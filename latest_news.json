        "article_text": "From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed \"the greatest show on Earth\".\nBut some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable.\nDanii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival \"is a big part of our culture\" it also has a very negative environmental impact \"from the events, to the textiles, to costumes\" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday.\nProducing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy.\nDanii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern.\nTo reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year.\nCarnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused.\n\"Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials,\" Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use.\nThe salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand.\nCarnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (\u00a3550), depending on size.\nDanii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. \"'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',\" Danni recalls people saying.\nCarnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.\nDanii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris \u2013 who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly\nLawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.\nThe two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.\nAliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: \"After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival.\"\nNow she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed \"Tipsy Tuesday\".\nThey also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.\nIn what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the \"King of Soca\" and a superstar in the carnival world.\n\"Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces,\" Kaleen explains.\nAfter sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.\n\"People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece',\" Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.\nBut costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.\nAt Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.\nThe organisers of the fete -  a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools \u2013 also hire \"bin detectives\" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.\nIt is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.\n\"Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass,\" says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.\nJoseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would \"add some layer of costs and more labour\". But he is adamant \"it worked\" and insists that the party spirit has not been dampened.\nThese green efforts are being welcomed by patrons such as Roland Riley, who hailed it as \"a good initiative by Fete with the Saints to go that route\".\nSign up here to receive our new weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

        "article_text": "The UK has been one of the most popular destinations for international students in recent years - but is its appeal starting to fade?\nHome Office figures show UK sponsored study visas dropped by 31% \u2013 from 600,024 in 2023 to 415,103 in 2024 - and with this, money many university cities rely on.\nUniversities UK, which represents 141 institutions, says measures to reduce net migration have \"created significant uncertainty around the UK's post-study work offer\".\nThe government says international students \"will always be welcome but the net migration levels seen in recent years have been completely unacceptable, and we have committed to reducing those numbers substantially\".\nCoventry in the West Midlands is particularly dependent on the international student economy. \nIn 2022-23, of universities with at least 10,000 students, Coventry University had the second highest percentage of international students in England outside London.\nThere were 16,285 non-UK students out of a total of 35,405, according to the most recent figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).\nJingwen Yuan, 30, spent seven years as a construction project manager in her native China, where she oversaw building projects that housed more people than are found in some UK cities. \nThe Coventry University alumnus has a masters degree in advanced engineering management and paid \u00a33,000 to stay in the UK on a graduate visa while looking for work - but has been unable to find a job.\n\"All of my bachelor degrees classmates from home have gone back to China,\" she says.\n\"My friend got \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000 from our government if she came back. And for us, if we choose to stay, we need to pay \u00a33,000 to the UK government. Can you see the difference?\"\n\"The one thing stopping more students coming here is recent changes in the visa,\" says Mohammed Abdullah Sayyed, 21, from India. \nStudent visa restrictions took effect in January 2024, meaning postgraduates lost the right to bring dependant family members to the UK and new students were prevented from switching to a work visa before the end of their courses.\nThere was an 85% drop in the number of sponsored study visas for dependants, from 143,276 in 2023 to 21,978 in 2024.\nMohammed says another factor is international students pay more than UK ones.\nCoventry University says tuition fees can vary depending on the course - but as of September 2024, most courses cost approximately \u00a316,800 \u2013 \u00a320,050 per year for international students. \nThat's compared to \u00a39,250 for domestic students, which will rise to \u00a39,535 in September.\nCoventry University says Brexit has had \"a profound impact\" on UK universities' ability to attract EU students. \nThe House of Commons Library states the number of EU students fell sharply after changes to visa requirements and funding rules in 2021-22. \nSince August 2021, new students from the EU generally have had to pay international fees and do not qualify for tuition fee loans.\nLaura Alonso is studying international relations at Coventry University. \nThe 21-year-old from Spain says: \"There's a lot of international people and international students, especially in Coventry, so you always feel welcome\".\nBut she believes the UK's withdrawal from the Erasmus+ programme put lots of Spanish students off studying there. \nThe Turing Scheme, which replaced it, funds UK participants to study or work abroad - but does not fund international students coming to the UK. \nWhilst the number of international visas has fallen by almost a third, the number of international students applying to study in the UK via The University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has increased.\nUCAS saw a 2.7% rise in international undergraduate applicants between 2024 and 2025\nHowever this does not represent the full picture, as UCAS figures do not account for students applying directly through colleges and universities, or postgraduate courses.\nThe overall fall in international students is impacting Coventry University's finances. It recently put hundreds of staff at risk of redundancy.\nSo it is little surprise the change is also being felt in the city's wider economy.\nCoventry University's analysis of Higher Education Policy Institute and Kaplan International's figures suggests international students generate about \u00a3651m a year for the city's economy.\nOne sign of a drop in overseas students is that several purpose-built student accommodation blocks are the subject of change-of-use planning proposals to convert them for residential use.\nThe volume of student accommodation being approved has attracted debate, with some residents objecting to planning applications. \nEstate agents report landlords selling up due to falling international student numbers.\n\nCoventry University says it is proud to widen accessibility to education: \"It would be odd to constrain our mission and values within national borders.\n\"Our long-term strategy of diversifying income to help counter the fact UK tuition fees have been frozen for several years has been successful and remains the right thing to do.\n\"The sustained growth in student numbers over a number of years allowed us to create many jobs and increased economic and social benefits. We are now having to rebalance the organisation based on changes outside of our control.\"\nThe government says its Immigration White Paper will set out \"a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system, linking immigration, skills and visa systems to grow our domestic workforce, end reliance on overseas labour and boost economic growth.\"\nVivienne Stern, CEO of Universities UK, says funding issues mean universities are reducing students' options - and the drop in international students is hurting communities.\n\"There are people in all sorts of walks of life who benefit from the fact that universities bring students in who spend money in shops and cafes - local businesses, getting their hair cut, taking taxis. \n\"It really contributes to economies right across the UK, and I think that's really special.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry.",

He's got a point to prove, that's the beauty of this year.\n\"Anyone who plays well in the Six Nations has a chance to tour in the summer.\n\"There are a few boys in our squad who are in the mix and he's one of them.\"\nJones came in as a scrum consultant for the tournament after being given permission by his Harlequins club.\nThe Wales scrum impressed against Ireland with props Nicky Smith and WillGriff John given starts.\nJones says he was shocked Smith, who joined Leicester from Ospreys for the 2024-25 season, had not regularly been selected previously by Wales with Gareth Thomas consistently starting. \nSmith has made just five starts in the previous 50 Tests for Wales.\n\"I don't know why he wasn't picked, because I wasn't here, but I'm glad to have him here,\" said Jones.\n\"He's been good for us. He made his Ospreys debut with me in 2014 and been around for a while. \n\"I always remember him as a young fella. He's always been strong, like gym-strong and I've always thought he was a really good player. \n\"Going to Leicester and seeing him again, if you're a Leicester prop, you have to have that scrummaging mentality and he's got it. \n\"He's been excellent. Gareth Thomas is a massive leader off the pitch for us and around the defence and they actually balance out pretty well.\"\nSale tight-head prop John, 32, was making his first Six Nations appearance and playing his first international for more than three years.\n\"He was excellent,\" said Jones.\n\"Will is someone I was aware about years ago, coming through and he did a good job with Sale. \n\"He came back to Wales to further his chances. It didn't work out but he's a big, strong boy, probably the strongest in the squad.\n\"So I'm pleased for him. He's a lovely kid. He's been around a bit now to find his mojo.\n\"We're in a good place scrum-wise. We're still getting relationships with them, which is a big thing in coaching.

I don't know how long it will take. We have a goal and we continue forward no matter what.\"\nWorking as a pundit for Match of the Day, Rooney's reaction to those comments was that Amorim should focus more on short-term aims that might keep him in his job.\n\"I think it's a little naive to say they're looking to win the Premier League because from where they are now, they're a long way off that,\" he said.\n\"I think he'll get time but it's not a free hit because he'll expect more from Manchester United than what we're seeing since he's been in.

To get further up the table, I think that's the next step for them.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFulham reach quarter-finals after shootout win over Man Utd\nRooney's comments about United carry huge weight given his achievements at the club.\nHe remains United's record goalscorer and won five league titles and the Champions League during a stellar period in which he was a central figure in Ferguson's last great side.\nHowever, he has a chequered record as a manager, initially doing well in a difficult situation at Derby, moving to Major League Soccer with DC United, but then lasting just 15 and 25 games in ill-fated spells at Birmingham and Plymouth.\nAmorim did not mention this when he responded to Rooney's comments. But, from personal experience, he knows talking about a team and managing one is two entirely different things.\n\"That (winning the Premier League) is the goal,\" said Amorim. \"To be naive is to think we are going to do it this season or be the best contender next season.\n\"I know in this moment, everybody knows everything. I was a pundit when I finished my [playing] career. I know it's really easy.\n\"Maybe it is not with me but our goal, as a club, is to win the Premier League like we did in the past with all the great glories and legends of this club.\n\"We are in a difficult moment.

After 16 days in hospital, they are still giving no prognosis.\nThe medical team has not spoken directly to journalists for over a week, and all updates are coming via Vatican officials.\nOn Sunday, they said the Pope no longer required \"non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy\". \nHe does not have a fever and was able to participate in mass in a chapel on the 10th floor of Rome's Gemelli hospital where he is being treated.\nThe Pope also received two visitors - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Parolin and his deputy Monsignor Pena Parra. They are the first to be mentioned by the Vatican in almost a week.\nThere are no details about the length of time the men spent with him or what was discussed.\nThe latest details do suggest that the Pope has rallied somewhat since Friday, when he suffered a second breathing \"crisis\" which doctors had worried might have a lasting impact. It was the second time the word \"crisis\" had been used since he was admitted to hospital on 14 February.\nBy Sunday, though, Vatican sources were more reassuring.\n\"The Pope woke, had breakfast with coffee, continued his therapy and read the newspapers as he usually does,\" they told journalists.\nIn his Sunday Angelus, the Pope prayed for peace, including in \"tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel\", adding: \"From here, war appears even more absurd.\"\nAlways outspoken against war, some of the Pope's previous comments on Ukraine have nevertheless created controversy. \nHe suggested that Russia's full-scale invasion was \"somehow provoked\" and on one occasion agreed that Kyiv should show \"the courage of the white flag\" and negotiate for peace.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has imposed\u00a0his long-threatened 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods, as well as a new 10% levy against China, citing the countries' failure to stop the export of chemicals used in the production of the powerful opioid fentanyl.\nThe US has long accused Chinese corporations of knowingly supplying groups involved in the creation of the drug. Beijing has hit back with tariffs of its own.\nThe White House has also accused Canada and Mexico of failing to prevent criminal gangs from smuggling fentanyl into the US.\nBeijing has hit back with a 15% tariff of its own, and Canada has announced 25% tariffs against $30bn worth of US goods, with an additional $125bn worth of products to be hit over the next 21 days. \nMexico is expected to respond later on Tuesday.\nFentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals. US regulators approved it for use in medical settings as a pain reliever in the 1960s, but it has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.\nOver 74,000 Americans died in 2023 after taking drug mixtures containing fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nIt is frequently mixed with other illicit drugs, leading many users to be unaware that the substances they are consuming contain fentanyl.\nAs little as a two milligram dose of fentanyl - roughly the size of a pencil tip - can be fatal.\nOver the past decade, the global fentanyl supply chain has expanded, making it harder for law enforcement and policymakers to control.\nChina is the primary source of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl.\nSince September, 7,793 lb (3,534kg) of fentanyl have been seized in the US, according to figures published by US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).\nAlmost all (98%) was intercepted at the southwest border with Mexico. Less than 1% was seized across the northern US border with Canada. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.\nAccording to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Mexican criminal organisations - including the Sinaloa Cartel - play a key role in producing and delivering fentanyl, methamphetamine and other illicit drugs into the US.\nThe chemicals used to make fentanyl are sourced from China by traffickers and turned into the finished product in labs in Mexico before being smuggled into the US.\nAccording to the DEA, the Sinaloa Cartel uses a variety of tactics to conceal shipments coming into Mexico, such as hiding the chemicals among legitimate commercial goods, mislabelling the containers, using front companies, and shipping through third party countries.\nThe Trump administration has accused the Mexican government of colluding with the drug cartels. Mexico's President Sheinbaum says the claims are \"slander.\"\nIn December, shortly after Trump had threatened Mexico with tariffs, the country's security forces announced their largest ever seizure of fentanyl - equivalent to around 20 million doses.\nIn response to the threat of tariffs from the US, on February 5th the Mexican government launched Operation Northern Border, deploying 10,000  national guard troops along the US-Mexico border.\nIn the latest government announcement on the operation, the Mexican government said that in the month since the operation launched, 55.9kg of fentanyl have been seized.\nIn 2019, China classified fentanyl as a controlled narcotic and later added some of the chemicals used to make it to the list.\nDespite this, the trade in other chemicals involved in the manufacturing of fentanyl - some of which can have legitimate purposes - remain uncontrolled, as those involved in the trade find new ways to evade the law.\nA review of several US indictments, which include details of undercover agents communicating with Chinese manufacturers, suggests that some chemical companies in China have been selling chemicals - including controlled ones - in the knowledge that they are intended to make fentanyl.\nDozens of indictments reviewed by BBC Verify detail instances where Chinese manufacturers have provided instructions on how to make fentanyl from products they sell, through encrypted platforms and cryptocurrency payments.\n\"So you have these massive loopholes where criminals engage in selling legal products, but they knowingly sell them to criminal entities,\" says Vanda Felbab-Brown, senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institute.\nIn a statement, China said it had some of the strictest drugs laws in the world and had conducted joint operations with the US in the past.\n\"The US needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue,\" it said.\nAnd while China remains the main source of the chemicals used to make fentanyl, the DEA has also identified India as an emerging major source for these chemicals.\nIn a US indictment from January 2025, two chemical companies in India were charged with supplying the chemicals used to make fentanyl to the US and Mexico.\nPresident Trump has accused Canada - alongside Mexico - of allowing \"vast numbers of people to come in and fentanyl to come in\" to the US.\nAccording to data from the US Customs and Border Patrol, only about 0.2% of all seizures of fentanyl entering the US are made at the Canadian border, almost all the rest is confiscated at the US border with Mexico.\nBut in January, Canada's financial intelligence agency reported that organised criminal groups in Canada are increasingly involved in the production of fentanyl by importing chemicals used to make it and lab equipment from China.\nThe trade in fentanyl takes place in both directions. \nIn the first 10 months of 2024, the Canadian border service reported seizing 10.8lb (4.9kg) of fentanyl entering from the US, while US Border Patrol intercepted 32.1lb (14.6kg) of fentanyl coming from Canada.\nIn December, the country pledged C$1.3bn ($900m; \u00a3700m) for combating fentanyl and enhancing border security.\nAnd on February 11th, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the appointment\u00a0 Kevin Brosseau, as Canada's fentanyl czar. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Gilder. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

US regulators approved it for use in medical settings as a pain reliever in the 1960s, but it has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.Over 74,000 Americans died in 2023 after taking drug mixtures containing fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).It is frequently mixed with other illicit drugs, leading many users to be unaware that the substances they are consuming contain fentanyl.As little as a two milligram dose of fentanyl - roughly the size of a pencil tip - can be fatal.Over the past decade, the global fentanyl supply chain has expanded, making it harder for law enforcement and policymakers to control.China is the primary source of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl.Most fentanyl enters the US via MexicoSince September, 7,793 lb (3,534kg) of fentanyl have been seized in the US, according to figures published by US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).Almost all (98%) was intercepted at the southwest border with Mexico. In the first 10 months of 2024, the Canadian border service reported seizing 10.8lb (4.9kg) of fentanyl entering from the US, while US Border Patrol intercepted 32.1lb (14.6kg) of fentanyl coming from Canada.In December, the country pledged C$1.3bn ($900m; \u00a3700m) for combating fentanyl and enhancing border security.And on February 11th, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the appointment\u00a0 Kevin Brosseau, as Canada's fentanyl czar. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.According to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Mexican criminal organisations - including the Sinaloa Cartel - play a key role in producing and delivering fentanyl, methamphetamine and other illicit drugs into the US.The chemicals used to make fentanyl are sourced from China by traffickers and turned into the finished product in labs in Mexico before being smuggled into the US.According to the DEA, the Sinaloa Cartel uses a variety of tactics to conceal shipments coming into Mexico, such as hiding the chemicals among legitimate commercial goods, mislabelling the containers, using front companies, and shipping through third party countries.The Trump administration has accused the Mexican government of colluding with the drug cartels.",

I want everyone at home to believe what's possible. We've been through so much as a sport, so much effort goes on behind the scenes and we're in Las Vegas - it's exciting. We should enjoy and embrace it.\"\nLike being in a washing machine - England's tough night in Vegas\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nWigan impress in Las Vegas with win over Warrington\nAt the iconic Allegiant Stadium, one of the world's most impressive sporting arenas and home to NFL side the Las Vegas Raiders, Radlinski's Wigan put on a show befitting their tag as World Club Champions, soundly beating Warrington Wolves in the event's opening match. \nEngland Women suffered a record defeat in their historic international against Australia. \nThere were victories too for Canberra Raiders and Penrith Panthers in the NRL matches.\nBut for even the most loyal travelling fans and the broader game, this was about much more than results.\n\"This is what this is all about, the opportunity to put the game in a new global territory in front of new audiences while also giving the players and the fans new experiences,\" said Rhodri Jones, the managing director of RL Commerical and one of those charged with building the English rugby league brand.\nMore than 45,000 people attended the Allegiant Stadium during the course of the four games - an increase of around 5,000 on last season's two matches\n\"I think we've grasped the opportunity with both hands, I don't think we could have done any more. \n\"Hopefully people at home have seen this has been an unbelievable event and hopefully it will be even better next year. \n\"The number of ticket sales is better than last year so that tells you that we have collectively made an impact.\"\nBut where does the game go from here? A number of English clubs have already expressed an interest in playing in next year's event, which has now been confirmed as again featuring Super League sides. \nIt is fairly easy to see why. Future options include building the World Club Challenge into the programme and expanding the number of games.\nBut while this has all undoubtedly been an exciting new departure for the fans already engaged in the sport, what impact this will all have on rugby league's future as a truly global sport remains unclear. \nWhat is certain is that rugby league has entered a bold new era.\nWigan fans travelled to Las Vegas to watch their team beat Warrington\nWarrington half-back George Williams walks down the red carpet as he is introduced to fans",

In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

The UK has committed \u00a37.8bn in military support during the same period.\nThe US decision to pause military aid came hours after Trump criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for saying the end of the war with Russia is \"very, very far away\".\nThe pair had an explosive spat in the Oval Office last Friday, with Trump telling Zelensky he was \"gambling with World War Three\" by refusing to consider a ceasefire without US security guarantees.\nZelensky left the White House before a proposed deal on sharing Ukrainian minerals with American companies could be signed.\nOn Monday, the White House announced it was \"reviewing\" the delivery of ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution\".\nThe order to pause all current American military aid to Ukraine takes effect immediately, and includes all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit and at depots in Poland.\nThe pause will affect more than $1bn (\u00a3790m) in arms and ammunition, including rockets, anti-tank weapons, and armoured vehicles of the kind Ukraine has relied on in its effort to repel Russian forces.\nThe pause in aid will heap more pressure on Zelensky to sign the minerals deal and agree to peace talks without the US security guarantees he has been seeking.\nRussia has tentatively welcomed the pause in US aid to Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a \"solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process\".\nFedir Venislavsky, a member of  the Ukrainian Parliament's defence committee, said his country had a weapons stockpile that would last six months \"without consistent help from the US\".\nIn an interview with Fox News, US Vice-President JD Vance said the door was open for Ukraine to return to negotiations if Zelensky was \"willing to seriously talk peace\".\nVance also drew criticism for saying that giving the US an \"economic upside in the future of Ukraine\" through the minerals deal was a better security guarantee for the country than \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". \nSo far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any eventual peace deal in Ukraine, although Sir Keir has previously said a \"number of countries\" have agreed to commit troops.\nVance did not specify which country he was referring to, but later insisted he did not \"mention the UK or France in the clip, both of whom have fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond\".\nConservative shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge had earlier accused Vance of ignoring the \"sacrifice\" of British and French troops, calling the comments \"deeply disrespectful\". \nReacting to the decision, Rayner told the BBC the Trump administration wanted Europe to step up and had been clear about its intentions to end the war in Ukraine.\nRayner said the prime minister was also \"laser-focused on getting peace\".\n\"He won't be derailed by announcements,\" Rayner told Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"He will continue that dialogue with our oldest and strongest ally, the US, and with European partners and with Ukraine.\"\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK and Europe must \"rearm faster\" following the US announcement.\nShe said: \"The news overnight that America is halting military aid to Ukraine is profoundly worrying.\"\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said the pause in aid between the US and Ukraine only helped Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nHe posted: \"I hope that Keir Starmer can use his new role to bring the two together and soon.\"\nLast week, Sir Keir met Trump at the White House, as the prime minister attempted the shape the American approach to ending the war in Ukraine.\nOver the weekend, Sir Keir hosted a summit of western leaders, as they scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under one proposal.\nBut apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.\nOn Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented a five-part plan to mobilise some \u20ac800bn (\u00a3660m) for Europe's defence and help provide \"immediate\" military support for Ukraine.\n\"This is a moment for Europe, and we are ready to step up,\" von der Leyen said.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine and are engaging with key allies in support of this effort. \n\"It is the right thing to do, and is in our interest to do so.\" ",

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the country\nEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.\nAt the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.\nBy rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.\nA little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. It has proved controversial and, anecdotally, the perception is that it has been a retrograde step.\nWhile the aim was to create an accurate reflection of a golfer's ability to take on any course in the world, many players believe the system is easy to abuse for those wanting to fuel their egos with a low handicap or for those desiring a higher one to be more competitive.\nBut is that a true reflection of how it is or a myth?  Certainly, there is a different view among those who administer the WHS, compared with those grumbling over a post round pint.\nEx-motorcycle gang member reaches Open with win\n67 million to one - Whitnell hits two holes-in-one\nBoom or bust? Golf in flux but is it really thriving?\nIt is an issue that affects millions of golfers across the world and England Golf, the UK's biggest federation, believes the system is working. Furthermore, this is being reflected by the recreational game's increasing popularity.\n\"The reality was, certainly up to the launch of WHS (in November 2020), that there was a decrease every year over a 10-year period with regards to people wanting to play - the numbers of people that played in competitions and then consequently, the number of people that were actually having handicaps,\" Jeremy Tomlinson, England Golf's chief executive told BBC Sport.\nUnder the old CONGU system that prevailed in Great Britain and Ireland, handicaps were effectively determined by performances predominantly in club competitions.\nNow it is easier for regular social golf to count. This includes shorter rounds over nine holes, performances in head-to-head matchplay and while playing with a partner.\nGolfers are able to submit 'general play' scores from rounds with their friends, provided they have specified before teeing off that they want their game to count for handicap purposes.\nThis means more rounds count towards determining a players ability. The best eight scores from your 20 most recent rounds are averaged to provide what is known as a handicap index.\nThis figure is then transportable to any golf course and is used to calculate how many shots you can deduct from your total score. The harder the course, the more shots you receive to reflect the level of difficulty.\nBut the system works on a level of trust. Some players want the lowest possible handicap to help make them eligible for elite amateur events while others desire a few extra shots to help them win swanky competition prizes.\nHandicaps can now be as high as 54 (previously 36) and the average in England is 19. \"The game's gone soft,\" is a regular moan among diehard members.\n\"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"That's probably because the old system lent, we believe, a lot more to towards the lower handicapper.\n\"But of course, there are just more people who have come in.\n\"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete.\"\nThere are 722,000 golfers affiliated to England Golf through clubs and the number is continuing to rise. Since November 2020, 38m handicap scores have been submitted to the federation's central database, with 10m in the last year alone.\nPlayers do not have to be a member of a club to gain a handicap, and the Woodhall Spa based organisation offers it's iGolf app as a means for an ever growing number of more nomadic golfers.\n\"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.\nNevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions. \"Griping is a big word, but I think that those complaining are frustrated that it is different,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"Golf has become a lot more inclusive in providing the opportunity for different people to win, and especially when their handicap is on the way down, while they're getting into golf and getting better and better.\"\nTomlinson added: \"The handicapping system is about integrity. It is more transparent than it's ever been because it is about the scores that you do. But there is a need for check and challenge.\"\nSitting next to the England Golf boss, Flint nodded agreement. He said: \"There is sometimes this thought that, oh, let's just ban the higher handicappers from competitions because they're always winning it.\n\"It's a myth. Clubs can use the terms of competition and have categories, so everyone can play the competition from an inclusivity point of view. Have a prize for the low handicaps as well as mid and high handicapper.\"\nSeveral county unions are now insisting that more scores from competitions, rather than general play, are used to calculate low handicaps when determining eligibility for elite tournaments and representative teams.\n\"We reserve the right to be able to review any handicap that has more than four general play scorecards,\" Tomlinson insisted. \"We have denied players entrance to some of our championships because they've had too many general play cards.\"\nTomlinson insists the authorities, including the R&A and United States Golf Association who brought in WHS, are keen to further the probity of the mechanism.\n\"The R&A are just about to bring out a specification within the system which will identify where they think manipulation's happening,\" he said.\n\"It's another tool that the club handicap committee can use to address that issue. It's not 100%, but it's something that will help.\n\"Ultimately, any system - if people want to manipulate it, they will. It's not the system that's at fault, it's the individuals.\"\nTomlinson believes he is presiding over a growing recreational sport that profited from the bounce golf received by being the first sport people could play after the 2020 Covid pandemic lockdown.\nAs the nation shut down, hundreds of clubs in the UK feared for their future.  Tomlinson sat in emergency meetings across all British sports. \"We were inundated with clubs saying we're going to rack and ruin,\" he recalled.\n\"Amazing. From that point onwards, people were starting to think about their health. Golf clubs became inundated with people writing to them wanting membership, wanting to have playing rights.\n\"And I promise you that the back four weeks of that initial lockdown, I went to those meetings and I hardly said a word because I was watching in my sport compared to sports like swimming, athletics, even cricket that were suffering immeasurably because they weren't able to open up their facilities.\n\"We were building something, and by 13 May when we came out of that lockdown, we'd almost got to zero with regard to our concerns up and down the country because almost every golf club was reporting in that they were filling up.\n\"And of course, by the end of that year, they were pretty much full with waiting lists. That's what happened to golf from from the pandemic.\"\nTomlinson believes his sport, at a recreational level, has been left far healthier as a result. More people are playing at every level, whether on traditional courses or at driving ranges, in simulators or at crazy golf courses.\nHe wants to exploit this enthusiasm to grow the sport by creating pathways from these fringe versions to actual courses, club memberships and handicap competitions.\nDespite anecdotal grumblings, the figures stack up to suggest such movement is occurring. \"And that's brilliant,\" he said.\n\"And to those crusty old golfers; we still love them. We still want to take care of them, but we need them to be a bit more progressive in their thinking.\"",

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",

        "article_text": "\"All the nerves we had that day just melted away because he was such a great person to be with.\"\nTim Baker recalls the moment that he presented the future King with the Royal Shrovetide football that he had painstakingly painted.\nIt was 2003, and King Charles III, who was Prince of Wales at the time, was starting the game or \"turning the ball up\", and like all those who are given this honour, the ball had been carefully painted with images that represented his life.\nMr Baker, 52, had been painting balls for the game since 1991 when he was asked by the game's secretary - who was also his milkman - to paint one for the future King.\nThe Royal Shrovetide Football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, is traditionally played on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday and has been held nearly every year since at least 1667.\nThe game sees thousands of players - in teams called the Up'Ards and Down'Ards - compete to move the ball to opposite ends of the town.\nNormally, Mr Baker said he would meet up for a chat with the person due to \"turn the ball up\" - but this was not possible with a senior member of the Royal Family - so he submitted drawings that were given the go-ahead.\n\"The current King is an accomplished artist, and one thing he asked was how we painted on a sphere,\" Mr Baker explained.\nTo begin with, he starts by measuring the ball, which is bigger than a normal football and heavier because it is filled with cork chippings.\nBuildings are particularly tricky to paint on a round surface, and everything needs to line up because the balls are hung up on display.\nRoyal Shrovetide is played over two days, and Mr Baker always paints the Wednesday ball - and this year it is for the farmer Brian Pegg and features a bull's head and a horse.\nHe said that some of the fine detailing can cause a headache, and each ball involves at least 50 hours of work. Within two hours of play, all this paintwork is gone.\n\"It's awful,\" he added. \"People will grab me by the collar or give me a nudge to say 'your paint has come off quick this year'.\n\"They'll tell you that, but there is nothing you can do.\"\nMr Baker said that he was not \"player material\" and had never played, but he was a fan who loved the history of game.\nHe works at the Historical Centre in Ashbourne, where Royal Shrovetide Football features heavily. \nOne of the repainted balls on display is one that was scored, or \"goaled\", in 1902, the year King Edward VII was crowned.\nIt is particularly special to Mr Baker because it was goaled by Joseph Burton his great-great-great-uncle.\nHe is much more relaxed about it all compared to when he was first asked to take on this role.\n\"I was extremely nervous to start with, because it is such an iconic item in Ashbourne,\" he added.\n\"I was not very old, and I had never done anything like this before.

Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Southern California is frequently shaken by earthquakes. How they feel to people living in Los Angeles has a lot to do with the sediment-filled basin the city sits upon.\nHollywood stars were just starting to arrive at their afterparties following the Oscars when the ground suddenly jolted. There were a few screams and high-rise buildings reportedly wobbled.\u00a0\nThe magnitude 3.9 earthquake that hit North Hollywood on 2 March 2025 was the latest in a number of jolts to have hit the area. The earthquake was measured to have occurred at a depth of around 9 miles (15km), but was felt in parts of the city several miles away. Another much smaller\u00a0magnitude 1.3 earthquake was detected almost in the same location a few hours later. No damage to buildings was reported.\nIt wasn't a terribly unusual event, by California's standards. The state is the\u00a0second-most seismically active\u00a0in\u00a0the United States behind Alaska, with Southern California experiencing an\u00a0earthquake on average every three minutes. In the week leading up to the post-Oscars quake, 36 earthquakes occured in the LA area, with most being under magnitude 2.0.\u00a0While most are too small to be felt, around\u00a015-20 events exceed magnitude 4.0 each year.\nThe most recent occured a little over an hour after sunset on 6 August 2024, when a sparsely populated belt of farmland near Bakersfield, Southern California, was shaken from a restful evening. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake, followed by hundreds of smaller aftershocks, shuddered through the area as a fault near the southern end of the Central Valley ruptured \u2013 the largest earthquake to hit Southern California in three years. The epicenter was about 17 miles (27km) south of Bakersfield and people reported shaking nearly 90 miles (145km) away in portions of Los Angeles and as far away as San Diego. Then, a few days later, another jolt rattled the Los Angeles area due to a rupture on a small section of the dangerous Puente Hills fault system. The resulting magnitude 4.4 earthquake had its epicentre just four miles northeast of the city's downtown area.\nAlthough there was minimal damage caused by both quakes in August 2024 and the less severe shake in Hollywood in March 2025, they highlighted just how the geology under California's largest city can alter the effects of fault movements in the area. The relatively shallow depth of the 6 August earthquake appeared to create more intense or prolonged shaking in some parts of the city, while others felt almost nothing at all.\nThere are various reasons for why this might be \u2013 including what people were doing at the time of the earthquake \u2013 but the enormous five-mile-deep (8km), sediment-filled basin that LA is built upon plays a surprising role in the effects felt above ground.\nWhile the ground feels steadfast at the surface, deeply buried bedrock can resemble a shattered window pane. These cracks, or faults, are where earthquakes occur. Faults are put under tremendous stress by the slow and steady movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.\nIn California, the North American plate and the Pacific Plate are grinding past each other along the infamous San Andreas fault, averaging about 30-50 millimeters (1-2 inches) every year. The movement is anything but fluid. Cracked rocks are rough and wedge against each other, sometimes staying stuck for thousands of years. Over time, stress created by the slow marching tectonic plates builds up and when the fault reaches its stress limit, it \"slips\" and ruptures, causing an earthquake. \u00a0\nA rupture begins at one location and travels in one direction along the fault, stretching up to hundreds of kilometers. The longest rupture ever recorded was a 994 mile (1,600km) portion of a fault that caused the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and resulting tsunami on Boxing Day 2004. \"The farther it goes, the longer [the earthquake] lasts, and the more energy that's released. So the longer the fault, the bigger the earthquake,\" explains seismologist Lucy Jones, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology and former seismologist with the US Geological Survey.\nDuring an earthquake, the stored energy saved within the sticky fault is released suddenly. Seismic waves radiate out from the rupture like the ripples created by throwing a rock into a pond, spreading in all directions through the surrounding rock and earth.\u00a0\nThe magnitude of an earthquake tells scientists about the length of the ruptured fault as well as the duration of shaking, says Jones. But the intensity of an earthquake \u2013 the ground motions we feel at a location \u2013 is shaped by how close we are to the epicenter, which direction the fault ruptured, and the geological layers under our feet.\nLos Angeles is located south of a giant a bend in the San Andreas fault where the plate boundary clearly changes direction. \"If you see it from the air, it's amazing,\" says Jones. \"It's so bizarre \u2013 you can look down and see the fault valley and then it just turns.\"\nAround the turn, the region is chock full of faults. Over millions of years, the faults churned and pushed slabs of bedrock into multiple mountain ranges and deep basins. Gravity, water and wind act like sandpaper, wearing down the mountains, and carrying debris into the basins. Over time, the basins have been filled with sediment.\nThe bowl-shaped basin of rock under Los Angeles is up to five miles (8km) deep, filled with a mixture of gravel, sand and clay. The contrast between the hard rock and softer sediment are big factors that cause some seismic weirdness for cities like Los Angeles.\nDuring an earthquake, seismic waves are modulated by geology, says John Vidale, professor of seismology at University of Southern California. \"The primary factor is just how hard is the ground and how deep is the structure that has soft [material] near the surface,\" he says. Seismic waves will move faster in denser material like rock, versus softer and less dense sediment.\nAs seismic waves travel through the basin, their behaviour changes when they encounter the loose sediment. \"[The wave] is now having to travel at a much slower speed, but it still has to carry the same amount of energy per unit time,\" said Jones. As the wave slogs through the sediment, the amplitude, or wave height, gets bigger.\nPut another way, imagine the Los Angeles basin as a giant bowl of jelly \u2013 the dense rocky mountains and underlying rock make up the bowl, while the sediment fill is represented by the gelatinous mixture. \"If you shake the bottom [of the bowl] a little bit, the top flops back and forth quite a bit,\" says Vidale. And atop this quivering mass of jelly is the megacity of Los Angeles.\nThis means the amplitude of the waves within a basin can be significantly bigger than those moving through rock. In one study, researchers using earthquake measurements in the Los Angeles region from the 1992 Landers earthquake found that seismic waves inside the Los Angeles basin were three to four times larger than sites outside the basin.\nIn addition to amplification, seismic waves can also reverberate within a sediment-filled basin. Think back to that shaking bowl of jelly and how the flopping top bounces off the sides of the bowl. Scientists from the Statewide California Earthquake Center simulated earthquakes in the Los Angeles region and found that the basin can trap seismic wave energy in a similar way. This reverberation can mean shaking can often go on for longer than the duration of the fault rupture itself, increasing the hazard for the city built on top.\nAs if that wasn't enough for Los Angeles, the close proximity of the San Bernadino and San Gabriel Basins to the Los Angeles Basins can create a funneling effect, directing seismic waves towards Los Angeles.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Will we ever be able to predict earthquakes?\n\u2022\u00a0The animals that can predict disasters\n\u2022\u00a0How your mobile phone can detect earthquakes\nEven within a basin, there can be differences in how the sediment interacts with seismic waves. \"There's variability in the shaking\u2026 there's variations in the geology,\" says Vidale. Sediment in the upper 330ft (100m) of the basin tends to be looser and less dense than the deeper, compacted sediment below. Sediment changes can also happen quickly at the surface. \"Old stream channels, for example, can be filled with a kind of wet, soft material,\" Vidale says. \"So, if you happen to be in an old stream channel, you'll get hit a lot harder than somebody even a quarter mile away that's on firmer ground.\"\nEven those in the same house can have different experiences, especially if the earthquake is on the smaller side. \"I'm in Pasadena, on the sediment in the San Gabriel Valley,\" say Jones. Despite both being in the house, she and her husband had different experiences of the earthquake on 6 August 2024. \"I felt it, my husband didn't,\" she says.\nWhile the city of Los Angeles ticks a lot of seismic hazard boxes, it is not the only urban center that needs to worry. Throughout human history, people have tended to build cities on flat ground near water bodies.\nIt just so happens that these sites tend to form above geologic basins and sometimes near faults.\u00a0\nWhile the US has a few famous cities built on basins \u2013 Seattle, Portland, and Salt Lake City \u2013 there are many others around the world that experience amplified seismic waves due to where they are situated. After the European settlers drained Lake Texcoco in the 1500s, Mexico City was built on the flat, old lake bottom. In 1985 and 2017, the city experienced significant damage from earthquakes that shook the basin sediments.\nThe desert megacity of Tehran in Iran also sits atop a geologic basin filled with river sediments, and there is growing concern about the risk of a major earthquake in the area.\nUnderstanding the earthquake risk is the first step in bolstering protection for a city against significant shaking. Enacting robust building codes can be another way to protect people and infrastructure, but it often takes a major event for stricter regulations to be implemented. After the devastating earthquake in 1985, for example, Mexico City enacted stringent building codes, and retrofitted older buildings.\u00a0\n\"The very first earthquake codes [in California] went in after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake,\" adds Jones. At that time, schools were built out of firesafe, unreinforced brick. \"Seventy schools were completely destroyed \u2013 luckily, it was at six o'clock at night,\" says Jones. The horror of collapsing schools spurred regulation, but initial codes were meagre. \"They basically just said, 'don't build unreinforced masonry in California'. \u00a0That was sort of the first basic code.\"\nToday, assessing earthquake risks is a lot more nuanced.\nIn the US, a team of seismologists, geoscientists and geophysicists have created a seismic hazard map, showing the chances of a damaging earthquake shaking in the next 100 years. In their latest version of the report, the team found that that nearly 75% of the US could experience damaging shaking. To help policymakers and engineers, the team included information on the implications for building and structural designs.\nWhile building codes can protect lives, scientists like Jones want building codes to go further. Designing buildings so they can be more easily repaired rather than needing to be demolished would cost an extra 1% in the construction phase, Jones estimates. \"We're calling it 'functional recovery',\" she says.\n\"We are trying to say that 'just not killing you' is an insufficient standard. The reality is, if your building's badly damaged and now has to be torn down after the earthquake, you've hurt your tenants, you've hurt your neighbors, you've hurt the local economy.\"\nFortunately, the buildings of Los Angeles rode out the latest quakes to rattle Southern California pretty well. But at some point, the city won't be so lucky.\n* This article was originally published on 18 August 2024.

        "article_text": "Most of the world found itself confined to their homes in March 2020 as Covid-19 spread at a blistering pace. Some countries didn't impose any lockdown restrictions \u2013 so was their decision the right one?\nIn March 2020, billions of people stared out through their windows at a world they no longer recognised. Suddenly confined to their homes, their lives had shrunk abruptly to four walls and computer screens.\nAround the world, national leaders appeared on television, telling them to stay put \u2013 only leave the house to buy essential supplies or for once-daily exercise, maybe. It was a last-ditch attempt to curb the spread of a terrifying virus that had already killed many thousands of people worldwide.\nIn London, theatre worker Tony Beckingham and his partner decided to use their daily exercise to cycle into the centre of the city one evening. \"We thought it'd be really fun to see no-one around,\" he says. It wasn't. Places the pair knew well, like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, perennially abuzz with people, were chillingly quiet. \"It was really upsetting \u2013 instantly,\" says Beckingham.\nThis deletion of the public from city streets, venues and businesses first began in China, where Covid-19 emerged. Quarantine orders were soon replicated in other countries after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. At no prior point in human history have people faced restrictions like this on such a scale.\nBut a handful of countries did things differently. Sweden, Taiwan, Uruguay, Iceland and a few others never enacted a lockdown that involved severe restrictions on the movement of people, such as legally binding stay-at-home orders applied across large swathes of the population. Those countries instead chose other measures, such as restrictions on large gatherings of people, extensive testing and quarantining infected people or travel restrictions.\nFive years later, the scientific studies and data have piled up, offering a detailed, long-term assessment of whether these countries were right to reject this most drastic of public health interventions.\nThe Swedish city of Gothenburg is a haven for dog-lovers, says HR administrator and blogger Anna Mc Manus, \"We have a very dog-friendly city here,\" she says. \"We even have a dog-friendly cinema.\" As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government had decided to buck the trend.\nShe heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. South Africa was one such country. This struck Mc Manus as terrible. At the time, she wrote a blog post in which she said, \"I am convinced that my government is acting in a secure and correct way\". However, she also expressed concern that her fellow Swedes were not always following the official public health guidelines around social distancing, such as limiting the number of people who could meet together in a group.\nMc Manus remembers taking frequent walks in beauty spots, but also that she and her colleagues continually wore masks to help prevent Covid-19 transmission at the veterinary hospital where she worked in 2020. Plus, she and her partner avoided restaurants and meeting up with lots of other people. Even now, Mc Manus says she is not sure what to make of Sweden's official strategy.\n\"I want to base it on facts \u2013 like how many people died,\" she says. \"Could we have saved a lot more people if we had had a lockdown?\"\nScientists have tried to answer that question. Ingeborg Forthun at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and researchers in other countries including Sweden published a study in May 2024 that compared excess deaths in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland during the first years of the pandemic.\nWhile Sweden avoided strict government imposed controls, instead relying mainly on voluntary behavioural changes from is citizens, the other three nations imposed strict lockdowns in the early stages of the pandemic. Norway, Finland and Denmark closed schools and most other aspects of public life while also asking people to work from home, but they stopped short of confining people to their homes in the way other countries such as the UK did.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found a noticeable spike in excess deaths in Sweden during the initial waves of the pandemic during the spring and winter of 2020, when Covid-19 was able to spread more freely than in neighbouring nations. But while excess mortality fell in the three other countries in 2020, it rose compared to Sweden in 2021 and 2022.\n\"The four countries have a comparable number of excess deaths when you account for the fact that population sizes differ,\" says Forthun. What lockdowns did affect, in part, was the timing of when spikes in excess deaths occurred. Of Norway's approach, Forthun adds: \"We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period.\" Whereas authorities in Sweden were criticised in 2020 over high numbers of deaths at care homes.\nSome economists have combined similar data with comparisons of economic performance indicators between the same four Nordic countries to argue that, overall, Sweden's approach was justified due to the relatively low economic costs. But such arguments are controversial and the lack of a lockdown in Sweden remains an area for heated debate among some.\nAnother study by a group of German economists \u2013 who modelled how a lockdown could have affected pandemic outcomes in Sweden \u2013 suggests that the substantial voluntary restraints enacted by people in the country appear to have replicated some of the effects of a lockdown anyway.\nOne Swedish epidemiologist, Nele Brusselaers, of the Karolinska Institute, has criticised her country's Covid-19 strategy. She moved to Belgium during the pandemic.\n\"I'm a medical doctor so of course I care about lives,\" she says. \"We want to save every single life.\" She says many of her fellow Swedes are \"still in denial\" about Covid-19 though some have come to question the lack of lockdown in recent years.\nBrusselaers, who lived in Sweden in 2020, notes how her posts about Covid-19 on social media resulted in fierce pushback from some who disagreed with her stance on lockdown as an appropriate strategy. \"You get so much hatred,\" she says. \"That's not something I was used to.\"\nEven today, some people find it hard to move past the hostility they faced on the topic of lockdowns. One university researcher approached by the BBC for this article said they were so traumatised by the abuse they received online in 2020 that they never intended to comment on Covid-19 control measures, or lockdowns, publicly again.\nFurthermore, some people who lived in countries without lockdowns, and who disagreed with their government's approach, are still reeling from the experience. Tanzania never had any Covid-19 lockdowns. The country's former President, John Magufuli, who dismissed lockdowns and other public health interventions, died in 2021. Magufuli's approach to the pandemic was \"unscientific\", says history lecturer Fadhili Mtani at the Muslim University of Morogoro in Tanzania. \"He advocated for traditional herbs and later he rejected vaccines.\"\nBut Mtani recalls visiting hospitals where members of his own family had passed away of an illness. \"I saw people suffocating in the hospitals,\" he says. \"The hospital said we should not say it's Covid.\" Official figures suggest around 840 people have died of Covid-19 in Tanzania since the start of the pandemic. Mtani says that the government has not made accurate statistics available, however. An international collaboration aimed at estimating the global excess deaths during the first two years of the pandemic has put the total number of deaths in Tanzania at somewhere between 102,000-188,000.\nMtani argues that Tanzania should have enforced a lockdown, though without placing excessive restrictions on the movement of workers. \"The majority of people are poor. To deny movement for them is to deny their existence,\" Mtani explains.\nMany scientists emphasise that lockdowns were crucial for saving lives in the early part of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, and also for limiting the pressure on health services. By March 2020, this pressure was already severe in the UK, says Adam Kucharski, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \"The NHS was overwhelmed,\" Kucharski explains, referring to the emotional testimony of doctors who have spoken to the UK's public inquiry into the government\u2019s Covid-19 response. \"It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point,\" adds Kucharski.\nKucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live together or with their parents compared to Sweden, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.\nHe also points to a 2021 study that attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. It reveals that certain aspects of national lockdowns might have been more impactful than others. The researchers found, for example, that banning gatherings of more than 10 people or closing schools and universities was especially effective, reducing transmission by more than 35% on average. Shutting restaurants and bars seemed to make slightly less difference to transmission, however.\nWhat's more, the researchers suggest that adding a strict stay-at-home order on top of such measures \"only had a small additional effect\" in terms of slowing down Covid-19 \u2013 estimated at below 17.5% on average.\nCountries that chose not to lock down severely may also have had more time to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19, or social and structural reasons as to why the Sars-CoV-2 virus was less likely to spread quickly there versus other nations. Even then, there are surprising comparisons to be made. Take Iceland and New Zealand, for instance. Both are wealthy island nations with relatively small populations but while New Zealand introduced a strict lockdown on 25 March 2020, Iceland never did.\n\"They [Iceland] had more of a mitigation strategy,\" says Leah Grout, a research data analyst specialising in public health at the Southern California University of Health Sciences. Grout was lead author on a research paper about the contrasting Covid-19 strategies and outcomes of these two countries. Iceland introduced a test and trace programme, in which infections and contacts between people were monitored so that individuals \u2013 rather than entire populations \u2013 were asked to observe quarantine for a time. This measure was also used in many countries that also applied lockdowns, when those lockdowns were lifted. Iceland had some restrictions on social gatherings and it did close its borders to some travellers, briefly.\n\"New Zealand had one of the lowest mortality rates globally with their approach,\" says Grout. \"Iceland also fared pretty well.\" Plus, the economic impacts on both countries were limited, she adds. Other researchers have made similar findings regarding New Zealand and Iceland.\nMore like this:\nMuch was written in 2020 about various countries' efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in retrospect, that seems much too early to come to any real conclusions. Uruguay was lauded at the time for apparently managing to keep Covid-19 at bay, despite never enacting a strict lockdown. The country's government enforced some forms of social distancing, including the closure of some gyms, and Uruguay's borders were also closed to certain travellers, for instance. But ports remained open and there was no stay-at-home order affecting the entire population.\nA study published in 2024 found that, while excess deaths were low in Uruguay during 2020, they actually rose substantially in 2021 and 2022. Excess deaths in 2021, for example, were nearly 19% above the expected figure, based on historical trends. The study's authors put this down mostly to the spread of Covid-19 but add that impacts from the pandemic on the ability to provide healthcare in other ways probably also played a role.\nSimilarly, Japan was able to keep mortality from Covid-19 to a relatively low level in the early part of the pandemic. By the summer of 2022, Covid-19 deaths had reached 36,200. Today, they stand at 130,000.\nSo, what happened in the interim? The Omicron variant. New, mutated forms of the early Sars-CoV-2 virus that spread worldwide in 2022 and 2023.\nSome researchers argue that Japan\u2019s approach proved to be the right one overall. \"Even without lockdown, suppression of epidemic curves has been largely successful,\" argues Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor in the graduate school of medicine at Kyoto University.\nHowever, as in other countries where legally binding lockdowns did not come into force, there is evidence that people in Japan changed their behaviour significantly anyway. One study of people's movements based on mobile phone data suggests that, when the Japanese government declared a nationwide state of emergency in April 2020, people in Tokyo reduced their outings from home roughly as much as people in the US who, conversely, faced legally binding lockdowns.\nDespite this, Yasuharu Tokuda, a clinical epidemiologist and director of the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, argues that a tougher approach might have been beneficial. \"Some patients could not be admitted to the hospital because of the lack of available beds,\" he says. \"If we have a strong viral pandemic, then we need to have a stricter lockdown in Japan.\" Research suggests that there might be resistance to such an idea among members of the public in Japan, however.\nIt is important to reflect on just how drastic a measure lockdown really is. Kucharski, for one, calls it a \"blunt\" tool. \"We should never have got to that point where we were in so much trouble, with so little visibility of what the pandemic was doing,\" he says. It was due to a lack of certainty over what would happen next, and a dearth of other interventions on the table, that the UK was more or less forced into lockdown, he suggests.\nMany have still not got over the effects of lockdown. In March 2020, Bill Allison, a former civil servant in Scotland, was in his mid-60s. He had many plans for his retirement \u2013 he wanted to see the world. Back then, Allison was also an avid pub-goer who frequently met up with his friends for a pint. Lockdown stopped him in his tracks. He says he followed the rules at all times but this left him feeling a profound sense of loneliness and isolation.\n\"I gathered up all the scraps of wood that I had and decided to see if I could make them into an electric guitar,\" he says. \"I would work late at night. There was nothing else to do, really.\" He found a guitar-making group online, through which he met people with similar interests. \"I made quite a lot of new friends.\"\nBut when the world gradually began to open up again, Allison was struck by a strong sense of what he had been missing and was hard to regain.\n\"The pub near me, it's nothing like as busy as it was before Covid,\" he says. \"I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before. I was discussing it with a few of my friends. [\u2026] We all feel very unhappy.\"\nSoon to turn 72, Allison says his pre-pandemic travel plans remain on hold. \"I'm kind of getting to the age where I don't really want to do a nine-hour flight to the other side of the world anymore. It's kind of knocked me back.\"\nCountless studies show that social isolation and loneliness affected thousands of people during the pandemic, and that this was a particularly acute problem during national lockdowns. There were negative impacts on single parents, also, who found it harder to earn an income while looking after their children. There were also concerns that the sudden loss of social interaction and access to education effected the development of young children, with some evidence pointing to an impact on their language skills. More than one billion children and students found themselves shut off from their usual methods of learning. Recently published research using data from 72 countries suggests that the closure of schools during the pandemic may have led to a decline in mathematics scores by an average of 14% \u2013 equivalent to seven months of learning.\nIn countries including the UK, lockdown was associated with a rise in domestic abuse. And, what's more, lockdowns had a huge impact on access to healthcare. Many people found their cancer screenings and treatments were cancelled or delayed, for example.\nAs for potential benefits of lockdowns not related to Covid-19 transmission, much was made of temporary reductions in air pollution and carbon emissions as a result of the restrictions imposed during the early stages of the pandemic. These turned out to be a temporary blip as greenhouse gas emissions resurged and air quality dipped once people emerged from their confinement.\nAuthorities in some countries that attempted to enforce strict lockdowns and a \"zero Covid\" policy were greeted with violent protests from members of the public. Some widely publicised cases of this emerged in China during 2022.\nThere is no getting away from the fact that a sweeping stay-at-home order is an extreme intervention, and one that comes with heaps of negative consequences. Governments in 2020 had to weigh up whether they could successfully enforce such a measure, and whether it was really worth it.\nUnless, of course, they had an alternative. The government in Taiwan, for example, never imposed a lockdown and instead relied on near-universal mask-wearing, border restrictions and intensive contact tracing, which involved access to lots of personal data. This included commuters' smart card information and mobile phone location data. Some of this monitoring was exhaustive.\n\"[Taiwan Centers for Disease Control] also set up a smartphone-based real-time locating system to track contacts' phone signals and alert local authorities if anyone left their designated location or switched off their phone. Authorities would contact or visit those who triggered an alert within 15 minutes in person,\" one paper notes.\nEssentially, Taiwan (and later South Korea, which to some extent mirrored Taiwan's approach) avoided lockdown through fine-grained monitoring and control of an entire population. Even in Taiwan, however, Covid-19 outbreaks caused problems. Initially, in the first half of 2021 and then again in 2022, cases surged as some preventative measures in the country, and the population itself, started to relax. Researchers note, though, that Covid-19 deaths became less common over time, as Taiwan's health authorities rolled out vaccines to the population.\nWhile these case studies of various countries show that it was clearly possible to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic without resorting to national lockdowns, the end results seem to depend on the attributes of specific countries, their populations, and their healthcare systems. Ultimately, the vast majority of nations did enact lockdowns at some point during 2020 or 2021 and it would be hard to suggest that they are all significantly worse off because of that intervention, specifically.\nStill, five years later, the harshness of lockdowns and their effects on millions if not billions of people has become clearer. Even some researchers who have found evidence that lockdowns saved lives have cautioned against turning to this measure in haste in the future. The longer-term effects on children, education and economies are still playing out and will likely not be fully understood for many years to come.\nWhatever governments decide to do, having a plan that they communicate in advance of any new pandemic will likely improve public acceptance of and adherence to any strict mitigations, says Grout. \"It needs to be super clear.\" That means everyone could know ahead of time what circumstances would trigger a lockdown.\nIn Gothenburg, Mc Manus remembers the debates she once had with her fellow Swedes over whether her country was doing the right thing in 2020. And how some people seemed cavalier or uninterested in observing social distancing guidelines at the time.\n\"You don't even talk about it anymore,\" she says, \"Thinking back, I feel like, as a society, did we really learn anything from this?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",

        "article_text": "The rise of second hand fashion app Vinted and people eager to find bargains has seen a rocketing rise in fashion sustainability - but one textile waste sorting centre said it has seen more garments than ever being discarded. \nSome 15,500 tonnes of clothing came through the doors at SWD Clothing site in Bolton, Greater Manchester, last year. \nThe estimated 60 million clothes come in from charity shops and local authority textile bins across the region, but there are fears a growing amount cannot be recycled.\nThe reason is thought to be the rise of so-called fast fashion, the mass production and sale of low quality and cheaply-made clothing closely following the latest trends.\nSWD Clothing said fast fashion is having a major impact on business because these garments are not designed to last as long as regular items and, by the same token, are not designed to be recycled.\nSo what happens to the clothes and what can we do to help promote better habits?\nMany people imagine most old clothes being recycled in the same way we recycle plastic but SWD said it is not that simple. Clothes listed as \"recycled polyester\" in the shops are most likely made up of recycled plastic bottles rather than old clothing.\nPeter Page, head of recycling and sustainability, said: \"It's very difficult because clothing is not designed to be recycled. It's designed to be bought, to be worn and then to be thrown away.\"\nHe explained that for textile recycling you mostly rely on single fibre materials but the use of synthetic materials in most fast fashion items makes that difficult.\nWorkers grade the clothing by quality, category and colour and the clothes need to be clean and dry to get reused or recycled.\nMr Page said that 75 per cent of the clothing that comes through the centre can be reused and is sold to wholesalers across the world.\nClothes that get sent for recycling are also used for carpet underlay, noise insulation or wiping cloths for the oil and gas industry, while new ideas are always being explored.\nThen, about three per cent of the clothes that are not fit for reuse or recycling are sent for incineration.\nSWD is getting busier every year, Mr Page said, but the quality of the clothes coming in makes it harder for them to reuse. \nQuite a lot. Among them, Valery Touchet started free classes to teach people how to sew and repurpose old clothes instead of throwing them out.\nMs Touchet said she had noticed the tradition of hand-me-down clothes she grew up with had changed to a culture of simply \"buying and throwing\".\n\"I just thought if I could educate people on how to reuse what they have already instead of buying new, that would help,\" she said.\nThe classes have brought together women from all different backgrounds, many who said they valued the \"sisterhood\" they had built as well as the new skills they have learned.\nMeanwhile, the Manchester Fashion Movement is helping to educate people about sustainable fashion by going into schools, hosting panel talks and organising pop-up exhibitions and fashion shows with an educational message.\nAlison Carlin said she wanted to \"champion local northern talent\" and send people away from her events \"with knowledge they can go on to discuss\". \nThrowing clothes into household waste bins means they are likely to end up in landfill.\nDisposing of clothes in a local authority textile bin located at recycling centres across the region or taking them to charity shops is the best way to prevent this.\nHowever, Dr Patsy Perry, reader in fashion marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) acknowledged how hard it is to be sustainable amid the temptation to buy new clothes advertised more vividly than ever online.\n\"The best thing we can do is wear what we already own,\" she said.\n\"Don't buy new things if you are only going to wear them once, and there are other solutions like charity shopping or even luxury resellers to explore.\"\nMs Touchet agreed, adding: \"Look through your wardrobe, there is always something [to recycle].\"\n\"If you don't know how to go about it, that's where I come in, to help you refashion, reuse them and repurpose. \n\"If it was a dress before we can turn it into a blouse, or a top and a skirt.\"\nA project by MMU has been collecting surplus clothing from across Greater Manchester, looking at whether the textiles are reusable, reusable but low quality, or non-reusable.\nMore than half the textiles in the sample were categorised as high-quality reusable, a small proportion were low quality but reusable, and less than a third were non reusable.\nAs part of the project, textiles that come through the Bolton sorting centre are being scanned to find out the material composition.\nThe hope is that the results will work out how many of the garments could be recycled into new textiles or other uses - in order to ensure fewer clothes go to waste.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

What can we do at home?Throwing clothes into household waste bins means they are likely to end up in landfill.Disposing of clothes in a local authority textile bin located at recycling centres across the region or taking them to charity shops is the best way to prevent this.However, Dr Patsy Perry, reader in fashion marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) acknowledged how hard it is to be sustainable amid the temptation to buy new clothes advertised more vividly than ever online. Among them, Valery Touchet started free classes to teach people how to sew and repurpose old clothes instead of throwing them out.Ms Touchet said she had noticed the tradition of hand-me-down clothes she grew up with had changed to a culture of simply \"buying and throwing\".",

        "article_text": "Rami Qattoush's mother beams with pride, as her nine-year-old son tentatively kicks a football for the first time since his injury.\nIt is a huge milestone in his recovery, since he travelled to Jordan last month after getting Israeli military approval to leave Gaza.\nRami dreams of playing football one day, like Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is still in pain and quickly tires, having to sit down on a plastic chair, exhausted from the effort.\nHis bandaged legs - one of them splinted - are badly scarred and withered.\nEvery step forward is hard.\nDoctors in Gaza had urged the family to agree to have both of his legs amputated. But his eight-year-old brother, Abdul Salam, had already lost his lower right leg due to his injuries and their mother, Islam, begged the surgeons to save Rami's limbs.\nWarning - This article contains distressing content\nThe boys had been fast asleep in the family's third-floor flat in Maghazi in central Gaza when, their mother says, an Israeli air strike targeted the building next door, raining rubble and shrapnel on the children.\nRami's 12-year-old brother, Mustafa, was killed, his body blown to pieces.\nHis heart, pierced with shrapnel, was only found two days later, Islam says. The family gave it a separate burial.\nThe UN says at least 14,500 children are reported to have been killed and many more badly wounded in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people. \nMedical evacuations from Gaza are critical, it says, because the healthcare system there has been devastated. Only 20 of the territory's 35 hospitals are partially functional and there are shortages of essential medicines and equipment.\nAn estimated 30,000 Gazans \u2013 like Rami and Abdul Salam \u2013 have been left with life-changing injuries which will require years of rehabilitation, according to the World Health Organization. \nIt has helped facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of patients since 1 February when the Rafah crossing with Egypt reopened for them. But it says that between 12,000 and 14,000 people \u2013 among them 4,500 children \u2013 still need to be brought out for treatment.\n\"The war has exacted a horrific toll on Gaza's children,\" the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) said when a ceasefire deal was announced in January.\nRami endured several surgical procedures without painkillers, anaesthesia or antibiotics, his mother told the BBC. His wounds became so infected that they were crawling with maggots. Doctors did not think his legs could be saved.\n\"Rami was in such pain, he was screaming 'God, you've taken my brother, now take me too!'\" Islam says.\nAnd then, in January, a rare chance came up - for Rami and his mother to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment at a specialised hospital for reconstructive surgery, run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Jordan's capital, Amman.\nIt is currently treating 13 children from Gaza, but has the capacity to take in dozens more.\n\"It's the only hospital I know of providing physical and mental rehabilitation for victims of war,\" says Marc Schakal, MSF programme manager for Jordan, Syria and Yemen. \"It's multi-disciplinary care, not just surgery.\"\nRami has a psychologist, surgeon and physiotherapist. He is also being fed, clothed, and taught at MSF's small \"School of the Future\", a bright prefabricated building in the grounds of the hospital. After missing so much education, he is a keen learner.\nBut he has also been missing his father Mohammed and his brother, Abdul Salam - who needs a prosthetic leg but wasn't able to leave Gaza with him.\nThey're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can.\n\"Gaza is beautiful,\" Rami told me. \"In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped.\"\nWith the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress.\n\"He arrived in a wheelchair,\" says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again. \n\"He's very motivated. He wants to get back to his friends and his family. He wants to make his dad proud.\"\nHe also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza.\nBut many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home.\nNot knowing if they will be allowed back into Gaza is another huge stress for all of the Palestinian patients on top of their trauma, according to psychologist Zainoun al-Sunna. \nSharing a hospital room with Rami is a withdrawn and traumatized five-year-old boy, Abdul Rahman al-Madhoun, who also needs surgery on his legs.\nHe was in his mother's arms when she was killed in an air strike in October 2023, along with his siblings. In hospital in Gaza, a nurse trying to cheer him up told him his mother had turned into a star.\n\"Since then, he looks up into the sky at night, looking for stars and talking to them,\" his aunt Sabah says. \"He doesn't talk to other people. But I hear him saying to the stars: 'Mummy I've eaten, Mummy I'm going to sleep now.'\"\nThe psychological injuries of the hospital patients are often tougher than the physical.\n\"Some will never recover,\" says hospital director Roshan Kumarasamy, who says that reconstructive surgery will be needed on patients from Gaza for years to come because of an \"unimaginably massive spectrum of injuries\".\nBut Rami is strong and determined. When he breaks down in tears thinking of Mustafa, he reassures me it's \"OK\".\nAnd when he and his mother manage to get through to his family in Gaza on a video call, Rami is eager to show them how he can now stand on his own two feet.\nHis father cheers him on, saying: \"Rami, you're a hero.\"\nAnd now his family have another reason to celebrate \u2013 Rami's brother, Abdul Salam, and his father have just been given permission by Israel to leave Gaza for Jordan as well. \nIn the weeks to come, he should be fitted with a new leg, allowing both injured boys to relearn how to walk.",

        "article_text": "Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza as it demands Hamas agree to a US plan for a ceasefire extension.\nThe first phase of a truce deal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US expired on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Hamas was refusing to accept a temporary extension proposed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.\nA Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was \"cheap blackmail\" and a \"coup\" on the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to intervene.\nThe ceasefire deal halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nThe internationally-mediated ceasefire plan - originally proposed by Joe Biden - envisages three stages. \nThe first phase came into force on 19 January and expired on Saturday.\nNegotiations on phase two, meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, were due to have started weeks ago, but have barely begun.\nPhase three is meant to result in the return of all remaining bodies of dead hostages and the reconstruction of Gaza, which is expected to take years. \nHamas has previously said it will not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from the mediators that phase two would eventually take place.\nAs the first phase of the deal expired on Saturday, Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed to Witkoff's proposal for the ceasefire to continue for about six weeks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods. \nIf, at the end of this period, negotiations reached a dead end, Israel would reserve the right to go back to war.\nWitkoff has not made his proposal public. According to Israel, it would begin with the release of half of all the remaining living and dead hostages.\nWitkoff is said by Israel to have proposed the temporary extension after becoming convinced that more time was needed to try to bridge the differences between Israel and Hamas on conditions for ending the war.\nA statement from Netanyahu's office said: \"With the end of Phase 1 of the hostage deal, and in light of Hamas's refusal to accept the Witkoff outline for continuing talks - to which Israel agreed - Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease.\n\"Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.\"\nThe Hamas spokesman said: \"Netanyahu's decision to stop aid going into Gaza once again shows the ugly face of the Israeli occupation... The international community must apply pressure on the Israeli government to stop starving our people.\"\n\nAid agencies confirmed that no aid trucks had been allowed into Gaza on Sunday morning. \n\"Humanitarian assistance has to continue to flow into Gaza. It's very essential. And we are calling all parties to make sure that they reach a solution,\" Antoine Renard from the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC.\nThousands of trucks entered the Gaza Strip each week since the ceasefire was agreed in mid-January. \nAid agencies have managed to store supplies, which means there is no immediate danger to the civilian population from this morning's Israeli decision.\nEgypt has called for the previously agreed upon ceasefire deal to be implemented in full.\nThe Egyptian foreign minister said his country would present a plan to rebuild Gaza without displacing its people at an emergency Arab summit on Tuesday.\nAlso on Sunday, medics said four people had been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza. The Israeli military said it had attacked people who were planting an explosive device in the north of the territory.\nThere are believed to be 24 hostages alive, with another 39 presumed to be dead.\nHamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage.\nIsrael responded with an air and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip,  during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to \"make India trade\".\nThe wildly popular financial influencer called herself the \"She-Wolf of the stock market\" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.\nLast month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain.\nThe regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education.\nIndia's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows.\nMany of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled \"investment gurus\" or \"financial influencers\" like Ms Patel, promising quick money.\nWith only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers.\nMost operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice.\nThe regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims.\nSebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes.\nThe regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration.\nSebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.\nAs markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.\nThousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals. \nSebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (\u00a310,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (\u00a39m) by selling courses.\nMs Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nWhile Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity.\nThe regulator has been both a \"selective\" and \"reluctant regulator\", Sucheta Dalal,  veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC.\n\"It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big.\"\nSumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy.\n\"Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation,\" he says.\nManish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed.\n\"Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken,\" Singh told the BBC.\nBalancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal. \nTechnology is inherently disruptive and the law is always \"playing catch-up\". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US.\n\"It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order,\" says Mr Agrawal. \nA Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations. \nThe challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.",

Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDevastating Arsenal can win Champions League - Sutton\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too.

        "article_text": "Being too hot or too cold can be bad for your health. So, what is the optimum temperature for your home?\nAs someone who feels the cold \u2013 but is reluctant to constantly turn up the thermostat \u2013 a hot water bottle and a thick fleece are two of my closest friends. And as relentless winter storms sweep the east coast of the US and Canada \u2013 and other countries across the globe are trawling through what feels like a very long winter \u2013 you might also be wondering: what is the best indoor temperature for your health and comfort? The answer, it turns out, is not straightforward.\nIn the 1860s, German physician Carl Wunderlich took the temperatures of around 25,000 people and found that the average was 37C (98.6F). This figure has been widely accepted ever since. However, new data suggests that this isn't strictly true. Body temperature can vary between individuals, with modern research suggesting that gender, metabolism, hormones, activity, age and menstruation all have an influence. So, with such variations to consider, is there an optimum temperature at which to keep your home?\nFor countries with temperate or colder climates, guidance from the World Health Organization states that a room temperature of 18C (64.4F) is safe enough to protect us from the harmful effects of cold. Being in a cold, damp or draughty environment has negative physical and mental health consequences, from worsening asthma and increased risk of heart disease, to anxiety and depression.\u00a0\n\"We recognise healthy homes are one of the key building blocks for good health. So that means homes that are accessible, safe, comfortable and warm help to protect our health, and support our communities to be healthy and resilient,\" says Rebecca Wilson, senior public health specialist at Public Health Wales in the UK, an organisation which advocates for improving links between homes and health.\nThe results of Public Health Wales's 2022 and 2023 winter surveys found that people were increasingly experiencing stress or anxiety in the three months leading up to winter due to rising heating costs (a jump from 57.2% to 66.5%). When the cold set in, more people set their thermostats to lower temperatures at home, and chose to heat specific rooms rather than the whole house \u2013 and, instead, turned to hot water bottles or blankets to stay warm.\n\"We know that all people who live in cold homes or face frugal poverty are affected. But the research does show that there's certain population groups such as older people, children, and people with disabilities and health conditions, who might be more impacted,\" says Wilson.\u00a0(Read more about how cold homes can affect health).\nEqually, overheating is also a health risk for those living in warmer climates, with an increased likelihood of heat exhaustion and heatstroke as the body desperately tries to cool itself, in turn putting stress on the heart and kidneys. Overheating can also exacerbate existing health conditions and negatively impact mental health, with links found to an increased suicide risk.\u00a0\nIt's a bleak picture. Research has shown a global link between both cold and heat exposure and mortality over the 21st Century, with experts calling for more public awareness of non-optimal temperatures as a health risk. This is becoming an increasing problem due to climate change and a longer duration and intensity of extreme weather events.\nExposure factors like occupation and socioeconomic status can play a role \u2013 outdoor manual workers often work through extreme temperatures and people living in poorer urban or rural areas may be subject to low quality, draughty housing, or in hot weather, have less access to cooling like air conditioning.\nBabies, young children and elderly people are also particularly vulnerable as they are less able to thermoregulate \u2013 meaning they are less able to maintain a core body temperature by balancing heat generation with heat loss.\u00a0\nFor example, according to The Lullaby Trust in the UK, the recommended room temperature for babies is slightly lower than average, at 16-20C (60-68F). If babies overheat, there is a risk of sudden infant death syndrome, so the charity advises using a thermometer to test the temperature of the room but also check your baby by feeling the back of their neck and chest to see if they are hot or sweaty.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0\nThe average body temperature of a newborn or a young child is slightly higher than an older child or adult, usually between 36.5 and 37.5C (97.7F and 99.5F). This is because their metabolism is more active, and their body surface area is larger in relation to their body weight. As their bodies grapple with thermoregulation, it takes longer for them to sweat, so their bodies hold more heat.\u00a0\nElderly people, on the other hand, may need their homes a little warmer as they tend to have a lower resting body temperature compared to young adults. Metabolic rate decreases with age, meaning it's harder for older people's bodies to produce heat. They are also more likely to be taking medication, or be suffering from a chronic illness \u2013 both of which can affect the body's ability to thermoregulate.\u00a0Diabetes, for example, can prevent the blood flowing normally to provide warmth. Even slightly cooler homes at 18C (65F) can lead to hypothermia.\nOne study observed that the physical performance of older women between the ages of 70 and 95 in a moderately cold environment at 15C (59F) and warmer at 25C (77F). Results showed that their physical ability significantly worsened within 45 minutes at the colder temperature \u2013 highlighting the potential safety risks for older adults living independently, such as balance problems and heightened risk of falling.\u00a0\nMen and women also have biological and hormonal differences, so our sensitivity to warmer and colder temperatures will differ too. Women tend to have more fat between their skin and muscles, so while the organs are kept warm, it prevents heat from reaching the skin and extremities (hands, feet and the tip of the nose). One study found that women's hands were almost 3C (5.4F) cooler than men's when exposed to cold \u2013 perhaps explaining where the phrase \"cold hands, warm heart\" comes from.\u00a0\nMenstruation also has a role to play, as core body temperature fluctuates throughout the cycle, hitting its highest point in the luteal phase after ovulation. And pregnancy and hormonal contraceptives containing progesterone can also increase core temperature. However, as women are typically smaller in build and have a lower resting metabolic rate than men, which reduces heat production when exposed to the cold, they can also feel the cold more, despite having a higher core body temperature.\nThe extent of the variation of thermal comfort between men and women is disputed. While some research indicates that it is marginal, one study from Finland suggests that it might be more significant. Take the office environment, for example. While it's unlikely that there's a temperature which pleases everyone due to our individual thermoregulation, overall the study found that women were often dissatisfied with the room temperature, feeling both uncomfortably colder and hotter than men. Another study of office temperatures in Japan showed a 3.1C (5.6F) difference in neutral temperature between female and male workers.\nHaving a safe temperature in the workplace is crucial both for health and productivity. Heat stress can reduce physical work capacity and motor-cognitive performances, and workers \u2013 both outdoor and those in poorly insulated office buildings \u2013 exposed to cold environments can be at risk of injury, cold stress and illness. In the UK, the law requires employers to provide a reasonable indoor temperature in the workplace. Regulations suggest this should be 16C (60F) or 13C (55F) if the work involves \"rigorous physical effort\". In the US, however, while the\u00a0Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00a0recommends a work temperature in the range of 20-24C (68-76F), it does not require employers to provide heat or air conditioning for workspaces.\u00a0\nIn the home, meanwhile, reaching an optimal core body temperature may not be a \"golden ticket\" to a perfect sleep, says Bill Wisden, a sleep expert and director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at Imperial College London, \"but it would help\".\nSleep, he says, is \"temporally related to the circadian rhythm of core body temperature and skin temperature\". In other words, a couple of hours before we go to sleep, our core body temperature begins to decrease when melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep cycle, is produced. Body temperature continues to drop throughout the night reaching a low point in the early morning before gradually warming up as the morning progresses.\nOne thing that can help you fall asleep is the \"hot bath effect\". Wisden says that having a hot bath before bedtime can help induce sleep. \"We've done physiological experiments with mice and found that if you warm the skin, that sends signals to the hypothalamus in the base of the brain \u2013 and that triggers an induction of sleep and a cooling of the body.\"\u00a0\nSo, getting under a thick duvet at night can help the body prepare the body for longer episodes of sleep or deeper sleep. Snuggling up like this \u2013 to warm the skin \u2013 is not unique to humans. Wisden adds: \"Pets, cats and dogs curl up \u2013 and some animals build a nest\u2026 that provides a kind of thermal insulation.\"\u00a0\nBut once you're fast asleep, a cool room temperature is ideal: between 16-18C (60-65F). While older adults might sleep more comfortably in a room that's a couple of degrees warmer, being in a room that's too warm can cause poor sleep quality. This can lead to waking up throughout the night, as well as a lack of non-REM sleep \u2013 the most restful stage of sleep. \"Being too hot during sleep is bad. It's exactly like a noise, or a sensation on your skin, or a pain. Being hot while you're asleep stimulates sensory perception and wakes you up,\" Wisden says.\u00a0\nUltimately, while we can be guided by research, it seems it may be impossible to find an optimal temperature that will please everyone. From age to gender, hormones to metabolism, there are many factors at play that might influence whether you prefer a hotter or colder room.\nSo, the battle of the thermostat rages on.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

This is becoming an increasing problem due to climate change and a longer duration and intensity of extreme weather events.Exposure factors like occupation and socioeconomic status can play a role \u2013 outdoor manual workers often work through extreme temperatures and people living in poorer urban or rural areas may be subject to low quality, draughty housing, or in hot weather, have less access to cooling like air conditioning.Babies, young children and elderly people are also particularly vulnerable as they are less able to thermoregulate \u2013 meaning they are less able to maintain a core body temperature by balancing heat generation with heat loss. While older adults might sleep more comfortably in a room that's a couple of degrees warmer, being in a room that's too warm can cause poor sleep quality.",

        "article_text": "\"China will fight to the bitter end of any trade war,\" the foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing declared, after China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on agricultural imports from the US.\nThis came within minutes of a new 10% US levy on Chinese imports that came into effect on Tuesday - which adds to existing tariffs both from Trump's first term and those announced last month.\nBut China's latest retaliatory measures are an opening swing, not a direct punch.\nIt shows some strength, and it has the potential to sting parts of the United States, but also leaves room to negotiate or escalate if necessary.\n\"We advise the US to put away its bullying face and return to the right track of dialogue and co-operation before it is too late,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian added.\nThis is the second round of tariffs the two countries have imposed on each other since February. But this time China is hitting Donald Trump where it has the potential to hurt - by targeting farmers, who are some of his core supporters.\nAlmost 78% of farming-dependent counties in the US endorsed Mr Trump in 2024.\nChina is one of their biggest customers for produce such as chicken, beef, pork and soybeans and now all those products will face a 10-15% tax which will come into effect on 10 March.\n\"The tariffs are broadly negative for US agricultural markets. It is going to have a bearish influence on prices. There are enough corn and soybean supplies in the world for China to make a switch, it is more of an issue for the US, because 30% of US soybeans still go to China,\" Ole Houe, of Ikon commodities, told Reuters news agency.\nBeijing may hope that this will apply some pressure on the Trump administration ahead of any potential negotiations.\nThe latest announcements raise the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world's top two economies and in various ministry statements, China is making two things very clear.\nFirstly, it is prepared to continue to fight.\n\"Pressure, coercion and threats are not the right way to deal with the Chinese side,\" said Mr Lin.\nBut secondly, it is also willing to talk.\nBeijing is not ramping up the rhetoric or the tariffs in the same way it did in 2018, during the last Trump administration. Back then it imposed a tariff of 25% on US soybeans.\n\"China's tariffs impact a limited number of US products, and remain below the 20% level. This is by design. China's government is signalling that they do not want to escalate, they want to de-escalate,\" according to Even Pay, an analyst with Trivium China.\nThe prospect of talks was raised last month. The White House said there would be a call between President Xi and Donald Trump. That never happened.\nSo will these talks take place and who will make the first move?\nChina is unlikely to want to go first. It will not want to be seen kowtowing to Washington.\nAnd in contrast to Canada and Mexico, Beijing has not announced new measures to target the flow of fentanyl. It simply repeated past statements that fentanyl is a \"US problem\" and that China has the strictest drug policies in the world.\nOn Tuesday, the State Council released a White Paper titled \"Controlling Fentanyl-related substances - China's contribution\".\nIt outlines the measures Beijing says it has already made to crack down on Fentanyl-related crimes and the precursor chemicals used to make the drug. It adds that it is \"diligently fulfilling international drug control obligations\".\nSo, while China hasn't picked up the phone to Washington, this document forms part of the country's message which appears to be saying - we are already doing what we can on fentanyl.\nDespite stating that China \"will not yield\", these latest tariffs are bound to sting.\nThe cumulative 20% tax on all Chinese goods comes on top of a slew of tariffs Trump imposed in his first term on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports. And China's population is already concerned about a sluggish economy.\nThousands of delegates are gathering in the capital this week to take part in an annual parliamentary session, most of which will focus on the economy.\nHouse prices are still falling, and youth unemployment remains stubbornly high. A potential trade war with the US could prompt more money worries for businesses and consumers across the country at a time when the Communist Party wants people to spend to help the economy to grow.\nBut Beijing will also see an opportunity as Donald Trump sows uncertainty among his international allies. \nIt can partly place the blame for any further economic woes at Washington's door and state that it's the fault of the US for starting a trade war.\nThe state media outlet Xinhua has in recent days released a series of parodies poking fun at a United States that is prepared to tax its allies and neighbours. The skits portray Washington as a bully echoing the words coming from the leaders of Canada and Mexico.\nAt the same time, China's Commerce Ministry has reiterated that it is prepared to work with other countries around the world to combat Mr Trump's tariffs.\nBeijing appears to be looking for potential allies in this trade war while also trying to cast Washington as a troublemaker who is prepared to target friends and foes alike.\nAll at a time when Donald Trump's \"America First\" doctrine has many in Europe and the UK wondering if the US-led world order is already in doubt.",

Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Canada is expected to react forcefully and immediately to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on its products. \nTrump has said he going ahead with putting a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, starting on Tuesday. \nLast month Trump put on pause his plans to levy a 25% tariff on most Canadian imports, with \"energy resources\" only facing a 10% rate.\nNow that that pause has ended, and the US is now set to steeply tax goods from one of its top trading partners, a trade war seems almost certain.\nCanadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters later on Monday: \"Let's be clear, if Trump is imposing tariffs, we're ready.\" \nShe said Ottawa planned to impose retaliatory tariffs against US imports of C$155bn ($107bn; \u00a3 84bn), with the first tranche of $30bn ready immediately to be levied on everyday goods like pasta, clothing and perfume.\nTariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.\nEconomists suggest that such a move could have devastating immediate impacts on Canada's economy - while also leading to higher prices for Americans.\n\"I won't sugarcoat it - our nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks,\" Trudeau said in a televised address to Canadians.\nCanada had worked to avoid a trade war. It has pledged more than C$1bn ($690m; \u00a3560m) to boost security at its shared border with the US - a key point of contention for Trump, who appears to be using tariffs as a negotiating tactic.\nTrudeau has said in the past that all options for responding were on the table - here are four of them, and their possible impacts.\nCanada has already fought one tariff \"war\" with Trump.\nDuring his first term, the US president slapped 10% tariffs on Canadian aluminium products and 25% tariffs on Canadian steel, citing national security concerns.\nOttawa retaliated by imposing tariffs on select goods, which were chosen to send a political  message to Trump and his allies.\nIt put levies on Florida orange juice, and whiskey and bourbon from Tennessee and Kentucky - the latter being the home of then-Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell.\nBoth countries ended up agreeing to lift the tariffs a year later. \nSenior Canadian officials recently told local media that if Trump imposed tariffs again, the immediate response would likely be targeted. \nAccording to US government data, 17% of US exports go to Canada. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the US.\nCanada stands to suffer a larger economic blow in any trade war with the US and this stark imbalance is why targeted tariffs are often the first and safest approach, said Peter Clark, a lawyer who previously worked on trade policy issues in Canada's federal finance department. \nBy targeting select goods, Canada can hit the US without widely punishing its own citizens, as tariffs can immediately raise prices for consumers at home.\nThis approach is also why officials are pushing a \"Buy Canadian\" campaign as a way to lessen the impact of a potential retaliation.\nBut pundits argue that Trump is less politically vulnerable this time, given that he cannot run for a third term in the White House. \n\"You won't have the same impact as last time,\" said Julian Karaguesian, an economics lecturer at McGill University in Montreal and a former finance counsellor at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC.\nAnother move Canada made in its first tariff war with its neighbour was to apply dollar-for-dollar tariffs.\nIt slapped identical tariffs on US aluminium and steel, and ensured the total dollar value of the American goods it taxed equalled the US tariffs on Canadian exports. That came up to around C$16.6bn at the time.\nThis time, the possible use of dollar-for-dollar tariffs could be much larger, with Canada posting a list of $30bn of potential goods it would tax \"until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against Canada\". The list is heavy on agricultural products, but also includes inedible items like dental floss and luggage.\nThat could be expanded to another C$110bn worth of goods.\nBut the more sweeping Trump's tariffs are, the more goods Canada could tax in response.\nNot all of Canada is on board with dollar-for-dollar tariffs. Scott Moe, leader of the mineral-rich province of Saskatchewan, has said that broad levies on US goods would \"rip this country apart\".\nMr Karaguesian said the promised US tariffs on Canadian goods could plunge the country into a recession. If Canada responded with dollar-for-dollar tariffs, it could lead to inflation.\nThis would result in \"stagflation,\" he said, referring to a combination of high unemployment and rising prices.\nMr Clark said that whatever decision Canada took, politics would likely be top of mind. Polls suggest a majority of Canadians support retaliation, and that many Canadian business leaders want targeted, dollar-for-dollar tariffs.\nCanadian politicians might be pushed to respond more forcefully if it means a boost in approval, Mr Clark said. \"We're talking about political decisions, which are not always rational.\"\nOne of the most valuable assets in Canada's arsenal is energy.\nNorth-eastern US states like Vermont, New York and Maine significantly rely on electricity sold to them by neighbouring Canadian provinces. British Columbia and Manitoba also supply energy to western and Midwestern regions of the US.\nAbout 30 states receive some of their electricity from Canada, according to Canadian government data.\nCanada is also the top supplier of crude oil to the US, making up 60% of total oil imports, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\nDoug Ford, Ontario's premier, has suggested that Canada cut off Americans' supply to pinch Americans at the petrol pump.\n\"The only thing that would really sting in the immediate to short-term is if energy prices went up, because Trump himself campaigned on bringing energy prices down very quickly,\" said Mr Karaguesian.\nBut the move would be contentious, especially with the oil-rich province of Alberta - which has refused to sign off on taxing its oil and gas exports, arguing that doing so would disproportionately hurt its economy.\nOther ideas have been floated.\nFord said that Ontario could pull American-made alcohol off shop shelves in the province, signalling a different approach in which different provincial premiers could define their own responses.\nAnother option is not retaliating - at least for now. For weeks, Canadian officials have been meeting their American counterparts in Washington DC in a bid to stave off any American tariffs in the first place.\nBut that seems unlikely, with Joly saying on Monday retaliatory tariffs would go into effect if the US imposed the 25% levies.\nCanada has also signalled that it could bring in a relief programme for businesses harmed by the possible tariffs, similar to those introduced during the Covid pandemic.\nSome argue, given the economic costs of retaliation, that Canada should instead focus on diversifying its trade relationships and increasing domestic production.\n\"We're a natural resource superpower,\" Mr Karaguesia said, adding that the country could use the tariffs as a push to harness that potential and sell its products elsewhere.",

        "article_text": "Antonelli is set to become the third-youngest driver in F1 history at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix from 14-16 March, behind Max Verstappen and Lance Stroll\nMercedes' rookie Formula 1 driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli rejects the idea that he is a replacement at the team for Lewis Hamilton.\nThe 18-year-old Italian is literally that - Mercedes chose Antonelli to make his debut this season after the seven-time champion informed them of his desire to move to Ferrari for 2025 before last season had even started.\nBut Antonelli's point is that he wants to make his own mark in F1.\n\"I don't feel like his replacement,\" Antonelli told BBC Sport. \"I just feel like a Mercedes F1 driver.\n\"But it's such a great opportunity. I am really grateful for the trust and opportunity Mercedes gave me. But at the same time, it is a big responsibility as well, because I am racing for Mercedes, top team, and so they've got some expectations as well, of course. I am just going to try to make the best out of this.\"\nStepping into the car vacated by the most successful F1 driver of all time, for a record-breaking team, appears daunting on paper. No pressure, as they might say.\nBut so far Antonelli seems to be taking it in his stride. He is, as his team-mate George Russell says, remarkably mature for an 18-year-old.\n\"I really want to start with a nice rhythm and build from there and be consistent,\" he says. \"And what I don't want to do is, like, big mistake. Because when you do a big mistake, you do a few steps back and then to recover it takes a little time.\"\nAntonelli is a name that has been doing the rounds in F1 for a while. He has for some time been regarded as one of the most prodigious talents in motorsport.\nHe joined Mercedes' youth programme at the age of 11 and was promoted to F1 after just one season in Formula 2.\nPeople who have worked with him have spoken in awed tones about the level of his talent, about how he could be the next big thing.\nAs such, the expectation was that he would make it to F1 before too long. But even he has been surprised by how quickly he has been parachuted into a top team.\n\"If you had asked me this four years ago, I would have said, 'this is crazy, not happening',\" he says. \"Maybe a bit later. If you think, not even four years ago, three and a half years ago, I was still in karting. Of course F1 was always my big dream but I wouldn't have imagined I would get here so quickly but I am super-happy and it is a dream come true.\"\nThis video can not be played\nAntonelli was 'really nervous' ahead of driving test\nHis promotion is a consequence of Hamilton's decision to leave Mercedes, which forced the hand of team principal Toto Wolff.\nWolff could still have farmed Antonelli out to another team to gain experience for a couple of years, as he did with Russell at Williams from 2019-21.\nIn the end, Wolff preferred to simply throw Antonelli in at the deep end, prepare him well with thousands of kilometres of testing in old cars, and trust his talent.\nWolff has said he expects mistakes, and that it is Mercedes' job to help Antonelli develop. And the driver - who crashed heavily on his second flying lap when given an outing in practice at last year's Italian Grand Prix - is aware of the responsibility.\n\"I want to have a clean run, nice rhythm, consistent,\" he says. \"But the mindset is going to be the same, going on track and try to win, try to be as fast as possible, try to get as best result as possible.\"\nAntonelli's talent is not the only reason he has stood out. There is also his name.\nHe is known universally in F1 as \"Kimi\", probably because his middle name carries obviously heavy resonance.\nBut although there is motorsport in the family - father Marco is a sports car racer - Antonelli says he was not named after Finnish 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen.\n\"Basically, my parents wanted to give me a second name that would fit well with the first name and the surname, but they didn't want a second Italian name,\" he says. \"They wanted something di\ufb00erent.\n\"A really good friend of ours, his name is Enrico Bertaggia, he has a background of racing. (Bertaggia was entered in eight grands prix for back-of-the-grid teams between 1989-92). He decided to name me Kimi. My parents said: 'Yeah, it sounds great.' And so I got named.\"\nAntonelli says he understands why everyone calls him Kimi, rather than his actual first name.\n\"It is more natural,\" he says. \"It is nice and short. Especially in the world of racing, it is such an iconic name.\n\"My best friends, my close friends, they all call me Andrea. Also my family.\"\nRemarkably, Antonelli was born five years after Fernando Alonso made his debut in F1 in 2001, and the two will be on the same grid as each other this year.\nAntonelli says it is \"a privilege\" to share the F1 grid with drivers such as Hamilton and Alonso.\nAnd there are other historical resonances about Antonelli. He says his hero growing up was three-time world champion Ayrton Senna, and coincidentally there is something of the legendary Brazilian in Antonelli's looks.\n\"Yeah, (people) told me that,\" he says. \"I don't really like being compared because I think you know every person has his own personality but he is my idol, he is my reference, so it would be cool just to achieve even little part of what he achieved in his whole career.\"\nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nNo-one can predict the score - Arteta\nEindhoven has been packed with carnival-goers in recent days but on Tuesday it was Arsenal enjoying their own party in the city, getting over their goalscoring crisis and setting a Champions League record in the process.\nMikel Arteta's side became the first team in Champions League history to score seven goals away from home in the knockout stages of the competition as they romped to a 7-1 win over PSV Eindhoven.\nIt was the most goals the Gunners have scored in a single game since beating Newcastle 7-3 in the Premier League 13 years ago.\nThe Arsenal manager said the win had given his players \"joy and confidence and belief\", but was not getting carried away when questions were put to him about the records that his team had broken.\n\"For sure, it's something that hasn't been done, so great to be part of that,\" Arteta said. \"But as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that.\n\"The happiest thing is we are in a very strong position to go to the next round, which is where we want to be.\n\"But there's still a job to do in London in a week's time.\"\nAfter failing to score in their past two games, a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest and 1-0 defeat by West Ham, Arteta may not have seen a victory like this coming. \n\"This will give them great confidence for the rest of the season. Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDevastating Arsenal can win Champions League - Sutton\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too. He took it well  and we're all there to support and I'm sure he will learn from that too.\"\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky travelled to Washington at the end of February expecting to sign a major deal with the US on the joint development of his country's mineral deposits. \nInstead, after an angry meeting with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, Zelensky was told to leave and the deal was left unsigned.\nThe Ukrainian president has since said he is still willing to sign it, and Trump has also indicated the deal could still be on the table. \nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine. \nThis includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.\nIt is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. \nOther elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.\nDeposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nFor instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nTrump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough.

        "article_text": "Martin Odegaard scored two of Arsenal's seven goals against PSV Eindhoven\nEindhoven has been packed with carnival-goers in recent days but on Tuesday it was Arsenal enjoying their own party in the city, getting over their goalscoring crisis and setting a Champions League record in the process.\nMikel Arteta's side became the first team in Champions League history to score seven goals away from home in the knockout stages of the competition as they romped to a 7-1 win over PSV Eindhoven.\nIt was the most goals the Gunners have scored in a single game since beating Newcastle 7-3 in the Premier League 13 years ago.\nThe Arsenal manager said the win had given his players \"joy and confidence and belief\", but was not getting carried away when questions were put to him about the records that his team had broken.\n\"For sure, it's something that hasn't been done, so great to be part of that,\" Arteta said. \"But as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that.\n\"The happiest thing is we are in a very strong position to go to the next round, which is where we want to be.\n\"But there's still a job to do in London in a week's time.\"\nAfter failing to score in their past two games, a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest and 1-0 defeat by West Ham, Arteta may not have seen a victory like this coming. \n\"This will give them great confidence for the rest of the season. Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too. He took it well  and we're all there to support and I'm sure he will learn from that too.\"\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

Welbeck finds a home at AlbionWith former clubs United and Arsenal struggling for goalscoring frontmen, they might both wish they still had the services of Welbeck.After 26 goals in his first four seasons at Brighton, Welbeck has hit eight in 25 this season.Among those eight have been some big ones.He netted in a 2-1 win over Manchester United in August, scored two winners at St James' Park this season and also got winning goals over Tottenham and Bournemouth. \"'Might be possible' - Could Welbeck win England recall?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Archive: Sweden v England - Euro 2012It might seem fanciful - but some are wondering if Welbeck's form could earn him an international recall.Welbeck scored 16 goals in 42 games for England, making his debut in 2011 against Ghana, the nation of his parents.",

        "article_text": "Located off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life \u2013 and adventurous travellers are welcome.\nFriday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades. \u00a0\nLocated off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (or Uaigh in Irish, meaning \"cave\") is approximately 15 minutes by boat from Cruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation \u2013 and modern-day pressures \u2013 further away.\nLast inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.\nI was spending a long weekend on Owey with the Wild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group \"somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible\".\nShe explained: \"It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming.\" she added.\nPaul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height of the Troubles.\u00a0\"My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,\" explained Cowan. \"The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].\"\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nHaving since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.\nDespite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.\nSeeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.\nOwey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.\nSix of our 14-strong group were staying in Owey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.\nPlan your trip:\nWhen to go: From March to September. It's difficult to get on and off the island when the weather is harsher during autumn and winter.\nWhere to stay: Owey Island Cottage Hostel offers self-catering accommodation for up to six people during the warmer months (booking is essential). There is a gas stove but no fridge. You can also free camp on the green space beside the pier, where there is a compost toilet for public use.\nWhat to do: Hike the island hills, climb the sea cliffs with Unique Ascent, wild swim in the clifftop lake, take a guided kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing.\nWhere to eat: There is nowhere on the island to buy food and drink so bring all provisions with you. Cruit Island Golf Club serves food and drink in a scenic setting.\nThe hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.\u00a0\nOne local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. \"Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,\" he said.\nAlongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. \"But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,\" he added.\nGallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare \u2013 and noisy \u2013 bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.\nThe hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.\nStay connected:\nDespite having no power lines, internet connection on Owey is excellent. However, there is no electricity to plug in a charger so bring a portable charger for your phone and other tech.\nThe car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the \"village centre\" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.\nFragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.\u00a0\nBy contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren \u2013 too rough to live on \u2013 with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.\nA highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.\nTo enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.\nPlunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed \u2013 engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town\n\u2022\u00a0The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'\n\u2022\u00a0Ireland's heartbreaking walk of forced emigration\n\u00a0\nOur last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals \u2013 who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend \u2013 joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.\nSitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition of the Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, \"We're winning aren't we?\".

        "article_text": "The shocking blow-up between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday continues to ripple across the globe, including through American voters who expressed frustration at one or both leaders.\nThe extraordinary scene saw Vice-President JD Vance accuse the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" to the US, while Trump urged him to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\". \nTrump also accused the Ukrainian president of \"gambling with World War Three\" as Zelensky pushed back at suggestions that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. Zelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early.\nWorld leaders and elected officials in the US have had much to say about the tense exchange, but so do American voters. We've asked five people what they think. \nThis South Carolina voter aligns himself with the Trump administration but he was frustrated by the Oval Office spat and wants the US to continue to back Ukraine. \nIt never should have happened. I blame both [Zelensky and Trump]. \nZelensky did come across as arrogant, frankly. I get he was trying to make his point but he doesn't know how to deal with Trump. [UK Prime Minister Keir] Starmer knows how to deal with Trump, [French Prime Minister Emmanuel] Macron knows how to deal with Trump, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin definitely knows how to deal with Trump, but [Zelensky] doesn't know how to handle Trump.\nSome of what Trump says is true. When he said Ukraine doesn't have the cards, [Zelensky] doesn't have the cards. \nBut Zelensky does have the cards in so far as saying that we will feel it in America shortly after Europe feels it, if Putin is appeased, because [Putin will] just reconstitute his forces and invade somebody else. \nThis Florida Democrat has repeatedly voted against Trump and said she was ashamed to call herself an American in the wake of the meeting. \nI had to pause it a couple of times to give myself a few moments to cool off. I saw Trump and Vance steamrolling President Zelensky and refusing to let him get a word in edgewise. \nThey were selfish, rude, callous, and displayed a complete lack of basic human empathy.\nIt's hard to stay optimistic about the outcome of this war, and I knew something like this was likely to happen after Trump was re-elected. \nI've been dreading this possibility since election day; however, I didn't anticipate Trump being this horrible about it. I'm terrified for Zelensky and Ukraine.\nIf more people had seen the full interaction between Trump and Zelensky, then this Pennsylvania voter says they would understand Trump's frustrations. \nThe majority of the American public is getting a sliver of what happened, I'm glad that was public but I wish people would watch the whole thing  because I think they'd have a very different point of view.\nThis war needs to end, but it's not going to end the way Zelensky wants it to end. It's a sad state of affairs.\nZelensky was expecting it to go a lot differently and I give Vance and Trump a lot of credit for handling it the way it did.\nPutin sitting there going, \"Damn, I better behave because Trump is holding no prisoners.\" \nThis New Jersey voter has backed both Republicans and Democrats in the past but was \"disgusted\" by how Trump and Vance handled themselves in the Oval Office. \nI was absolutely disgusted with it. Even if Zelensky and the Ukrainians were considered adversarial to us, you wouldn't talk to their head of state or head of government that way.\nI would go beyond sending more aid to Ukraine - I would go as far as saying we should send military assets: putting planes in the air or putting boots on the ground. \n[Putin] operates like a bully. The only way you're really going to get a bully to reconsider their actions is to stand up to them - you have to be willing to punch them in the mouth at some point in time. \nThis Indiana Trump voter wants to help Ukraine, but thinks there should be limit to US generosity to ensure Americans are taken care of too. \nI want to help them as much as we can but we can't keep giving, giving, giving.\nZelensky had good reason to want more, but I feel like he was in the wrong to ask for it in that manner. If he did it in private, it would have been the place for it.\nI didn't feel like Trump or Vance's reaction to it was wrong. It wasn't perfect, but I don't think it was a bad reaction per se. I hope there can be reconciliation after this, I want to help them end this war. \nBut if there isn't some middle ground they can find, I don't want to see the US to continue to spend and spend on a country that isn't ours when we have domestic problems.\nThis California voter was taken aback by the \"arrogant stance\" of Trump and Vance against Zelensky. \nAll it seemed like Trump and Vance wanted to do was \"make a deal\", in other words turn a profit from this conflict. Ukraine doesn't need trade partners. It needs allies, nations who aren't afraid to put some skin in this fight and fend off an invading enemy.\nThe world's leaders need to take in the full scope of this conflict and stop letting Vladimir Putin dictate the rules of engagement. \nThe war in Ukraine is not some limited regional border dispute. This is a case of full-blown invasion by one sovereign nation of another. \nThe war has gone on long enough for Ukraine to fight it without any other allies fighting alongside them in battle. Ukraine can't and shouldn't fight this war alone.\nThis Indiana voter supports the president but described Trump and Vance's behaviour as the wrong move. \nIn all my years alive, I've never seen anything like that before. I understand behind closed doors things like this happen, but the Oval Office is not where you're displaying your dirty laundry.\nI'm not a big fan of Zelensky but I found what happened in the Oval Office the other day is embarrassing.\nIt's getting muddled up between the personalities on display there but the fact of the matter is Russia invaded Ukraine not once but twice.\nRussia is the aggressor.\nI understand the administration wants to show the world what we're dealing with, but we're supposed to be the leader of the world and good leaders don't lose their cool at this level.\nI don't want to appear that I'm hostile of Trump, but I just think this style of leadership is not productive.",

I don't know how long it will take.

But, from personal experience, he knows talking about a team and managing one is two entirely different things.\n\"That (winning the Premier League) is the goal,\" said Amorim. \"To be naive is to think we are going to do it this season or be the best contender next season.\n\"I know in this moment, everybody knows everything. I was a pundit when I finished my [playing] career.

        "article_text": "Will Stuart has started England's last nine games and played 70 minutes in the win over Scotland last time out\nMen's Six Nations: England v Italy\nDate: Sunday 9 March Kick-off: 15:00 GMT  Venue: Allianz Stadium, Twickenham\nCoverage: Live audio commentary via the BBC Sport website and app\nWill Stuart knows his history.\nAway from the pitch, the England prop has just finished reading Tom Holland's Rubicon, a book on power and plotting in the Roman Empire. \nBeneath that on the bedside table is a biography of military genius Napoleon Bonaparte.\nIn Stuart's earphones has been a podcast detailing the brutality of the Eastern Front in World War Two.\nProfessionally, though he has been stewing over more recent events.\nEight months ago, Stuart was forced into his own retreat, coming under severe scrum pressure in two summer Tests in New Zealand.\nCoach Steve Borthwick publicly admitted he was looking for reinforcements in Stuart's tight-head prop position.\nThe 28-year-old was duly left off the list for the first set of central contracts in October.\nHis job security wasn't helped by a trio of front-row tyros \u2013 Afolabi Fasogbon, Billy Sela and Asher Opoku Fordjour \u2013 emerging out of England's Under-20 Rugby World Cup success either.\n\"In the summer I knew I hadn't done myself any kind of justice, that I hadn't put my hand forward,\" Stuart tells BBC Sport.\n\"There were open and honest conversations and I was under no illusion that performance-wise I had a lot of work to do.\n\"I just needed to get my head down, fly into club games, get better and try to cement myself more as a starting tight-head.\"\nIn typically understated fashion, he has done just that.\nHis club side Bath are well clear at the top of the Premiership, while he took on the southern-hemisphere's finest at the set-piece in the autumn and held his own. And, so far in the Six Nations, he has been one of England's big plus points.\nStuart and his front-row colleagues are in profit in the tournament, winning five scrum penalties and conceded three across their face-offs with Ireland, France and Scotland - a stat few would have predicted after their struggles in New Zealand.\n\"We have taken a step forward from last summer,\" he adds.\n\"We came into the autumn, we were very clean, good on our own ball, we were trying to be square and rock solid.\n\"Now there is a big onus on trying to take another step forward - to being dominant.\"\nStuart has been helped by the lingering effects of a 2022 elbow dislocation finally dissipating.\nBut that scrum supremacy is also closer thanks to a more collaborative approach in training.\nThis video can not be played\nSinging Adele & cracking jokes - Joe Marler\u2019s hilarious BBC Sport debut\nThe focus has shifted from scrapping for starting spots to laying waste to England's opponents.\n\"When you come in this environment you are competing with other lads to try to play,\" Stuart says.\n\"Scrums are very competitive, combative places and it can end up being messy and a bit of a 'man test', with stuff going on the floor. That is not really how you want to train.\n\"You want to train so that everyone gets better \u2013 keeping scrums off the deck and not wasting any reps. It was something that Coley [Dan Cole] spoke about in the summer. Ever since then we have been training very purposefully,\n\"It is still competitive, but you realise there is no point collapsing in a scrum in training when you are about to get sent backwards. It is about taking your medicine, keeping it up, being clean.\n\"It feels like the group has all bought into it. It feels like a big shift in that regard.\"\nIt is perhaps not a surprise this collective approach has brought the best out of Stuart.\nA 2022 elbow dislocation, suffered the week after scoring two tries against New Zealand, set back Stuart's international progress\nThere have been some big characters among England's biggest men in recent years, with Joe Marler, who retired in the autumn, the most notable. Vice-captain Ellis Genge speaks his mind to those inside and outside the camp, while former skipper Jamie George is still a key leader. Even Cole has his own podcast.\nStuart, who will end the Six Nations on 50 caps if he plays against Italy and Wales, prefers a lower profile.\n\"I am pretty awful,\" he smiles. \"How can I put this? I am not the most sociable person, I am a bit of a hermit.\n\"I live in a little village outside of Bath and it is very quiet, which is my set-up and how I like it.\"\nIt is getting difficult for him to escape the hubbub though.\nHis form, and Ireland tight-head Tadhg Furlong's injury run, has put him firmly into Lions contention.\nStuart would be a first-time tourist - his Lions memories don't stretch as far back as his books.\nHe remembers watching the 2013 trip to Australia at school and then, after turning professional, hearing Bath team-mate Jamie Roberts recount his experiences on repeat.\n\"He was always reminding everyone that he was the Lions man of the tour in 2009, he wouldn't stop going on about it,\" Stuart jokes. \"I think he made us watch his clips.\n\"I haven't really thought about it. After the last summer I just needed to knuckle down, game by game, and play well. I am just trying to stay along those lines.\"\nReading up on the past, while not reading too far into the future, has kept him well on course so far.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nJonas turned professional in 2017 and has won 16 fights, lost two and drawn one \nNatasha Jonas v Lauren Price\nVenue: Royal Albert Hall, London Date: Friday, 7 March\nCoverage: Follow live text commentary from 20:00 GMT and radio coverage from 21:00 on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds, BBC Sport website & app\nSetbacks lead to comebacks. Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

I want everyone at home to believe what's possible. We've been through so much as a sport, so much effort goes on behind the scenes and we're in Las Vegas - it's exciting. We should enjoy and embrace it.\"\nLike being in a washing machine - England's tough night in Vegas\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nWigan impress in Las Vegas with win over Warrington\nAt the iconic Allegiant Stadium, one of the world's most impressive sporting arenas and home to NFL side the Las Vegas Raiders, Radlinski's Wigan put on a show befitting their tag as World Club Champions, soundly beating Warrington Wolves in the event's opening match. \nEngland Women suffered a record defeat in their historic international against Australia. \nThere were victories too for Canberra Raiders and Penrith Panthers in the NRL matches.\nBut for even the most loyal travelling fans and the broader game, this was about much more than results.\n\"This is what this is all about, the opportunity to put the game in a new global territory in front of new audiences while also giving the players and the fans new experiences,\" said Rhodri Jones, the managing director of RL Commerical and one of those charged with building the English rugby league brand.\nMore than 45,000 people attended the Allegiant Stadium during the course of the four games - an increase of around 5,000 on last season's two matches\n\"I think we've grasped the opportunity with both hands, I don't think we could have done any more. \n\"Hopefully people at home have seen this has been an unbelievable event and hopefully it will be even better next year. \n\"The number of ticket sales is better than last year so that tells you that we have collectively made an impact.\"\nBut where does the game go from here? A number of English clubs have already expressed an interest in playing in next year's event, which has now been confirmed as again featuring Super League sides. \nIt is fairly easy to see why. Future options include building the World Club Challenge into the programme and expanding the number of games.\nBut while this has all undoubtedly been an exciting new departure for the fans already engaged in the sport, what impact this will all have on rugby league's future as a truly global sport remains unclear. \nWhat is certain is that rugby league has entered a bold new era.\nWigan fans travelled to Las Vegas to watch their team beat Warrington\nWarrington half-back George Williams walks down the red carpet as he is introduced to fans",

        "article_text": "The speaker of the house in New Zealand's parliament says he will not consider any further complaints from lawmakers over the use of the country's M\u0101ori name in proceedings.\n\"Aotearoa is regularly used as a name of New Zealand,\" Speaker Gerry Brownlee said in a ruling in Parliament on Tuesday. \nHis comments come after Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters asked Brownlee to bar the use of the name Aotearoa, and suggested a referendum would be needed for anyone to use it in parliament. \nWhile New Zealand is the legal name of the country and can only be changed by law, Aotearoa, which translates to \"land of the long white cloud\", has long been used when referring to New Zealand in M\u0101ori.\n\"It [Aotearoa] appears on our passports and it appears on our currency,\" Brownlee said on Tuesday. The name is also used in the M\u0101ori version of New Zealand's national anthem, which is commonly heard before the English version. \n\"If other members do not like certain words, they don't have to use them. But it's not a matter of order, and I don't expect to have further points of order raised about it,\" he added. \nMPs are allowed to use any of the country's three official languages - English, M\u0101ori and New Zealand sign language - when speaking in Parliament. \nThe objection by Peters, who is M\u0101ori, arose last month, when Green MP Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez March used it during a parliamentary session.\n\"Why is someone who applied to come to this country in 2006 allowed to ask a question of this Parliament that changes this country's name without the referendum and sanction of the New Zealand people?\" Peters asked.\nMen\u00e9ndez March is originally from Mexico but is a New Zealand citizen, as all MPs must be. \nShane Jones, another government minister who is a member of Peters' New Zealand First party and is also M\u0101ori, questioned \"the appropriateness of recent immigrants telling M\u0101ori what the name of our country should be?\"\nAt the time, Brownlee encouraged lawmakers to use the name Aotearoa New Zealand instead in order to avoid any confusion but said it was not a requirement. \nNot all M\u0101ori have the same connection to the name Aotearoa, which was originally used to describe New Zealand's North Island only. However, it is often used by non-M\u0101ori out of respect for indigenous people. \nWinston Peters said on Tuesday that he disagreed with Brownlee's ruling, Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported.\nHe added that he only had a problem with Aotearoa being used in Parliament, not of M\u0101ori in general, and that, if a question was addressed to him in future using the name, he would not answer. \nThe use of M\u0101ori in public has grown considerably across New Zealand in recent decades, following advocacy from indigenous leaders. \nA petition was launched in 2022 by the M\u0101ori Party, an official political party, to officially change the country's name to Aotearoa, which received more than 70,000 signatures.\n\"New Zealand is a Dutch name and has no connection to this whenua [land]. How many people in Aotearoa can even point to 'old' Zealand on a map?\" M\u0101ori Party Co-leader Rawiri Waititi said at the time. \nSince the current administration came into power in 2023, it has required that government departments prioritise their English names and communicate primarily in English, unless they are specifically related to M\u0101ori.\nAnother of the coalition's members, the Act party, is also seeking to redefine the terms of New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, which has been met with fierce opposition.

Clothes listed as \"recycled polyester\" in the shops are most likely made up of recycled plastic bottles rather than old clothing.\nPeter Page, head of recycling and sustainability, said: \"It's very difficult because clothing is not designed to be recycled. It's designed to be bought, to be worn and then to be thrown away.\"\nHe explained that for textile recycling you mostly rely on single fibre materials but the use of synthetic materials in most fast fashion items makes that difficult.\nWorkers grade the clothing by quality, category and colour and the clothes need to be clean and dry to get reused or recycled.\nMr Page said that 75 per cent of the clothing that comes through the centre can be reused and is sold to wholesalers across the world.\nClothes that get sent for recycling are also used for carpet underlay, noise insulation or wiping cloths for the oil and gas industry, while new ideas are always being explored.\nThen, about three per cent of the clothes that are not fit for reuse or recycling are sent for incineration.\nSWD is getting busier every year, Mr Page said, but the quality of the clothes coming in makes it harder for them to reuse. \nQuite a lot. Among them, Valery Touchet started free classes to teach people how to sew and repurpose old clothes instead of throwing them out.\nMs Touchet said she had noticed the tradition of hand-me-down clothes she grew up with had changed to a culture of simply \"buying and throwing\".\n\"I just thought if I could educate people on how to reuse what they have already instead of buying new, that would help,\" she said.\nThe classes have brought together women from all different backgrounds, many who said they valued the \"sisterhood\" they had built as well as the new skills they have learned.\nMeanwhile, the Manchester Fashion Movement is helping to educate people about sustainable fashion by going into schools, hosting panel talks and organising pop-up exhibitions and fashion shows with an educational message.\nAlison Carlin said she wanted to \"champion local northern talent\" and send people away from her events \"with knowledge they can go on to discuss\". \nThrowing clothes into household waste bins means they are likely to end up in landfill.\nDisposing of clothes in a local authority textile bin located at recycling centres across the region or taking them to charity shops is the best way to prevent this.\nHowever, Dr Patsy Perry, reader in fashion marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) acknowledged how hard it is to be sustainable amid the temptation to buy new clothes advertised more vividly than ever online.\n\"The best thing we can do is wear what we already own,\" she said.\n\"Don't buy new things if you are only going to wear them once, and there are other solutions like charity shopping or even luxury resellers to explore.\"\nMs Touchet agreed, adding: \"Look through your wardrobe, there is always something [to recycle].\"\n\"If you don't know how to go about it, that's where I come in, to help you refashion, reuse them and repurpose. \n\"If it was a dress before we can turn it into a blouse, or a top and a skirt.\"\nA project by MMU has been collecting surplus clothing from across Greater Manchester, looking at whether the textiles are reusable, reusable but low quality, or non-reusable.\nMore than half the textiles in the sample were categorised as high-quality reusable, a small proportion were low quality but reusable, and less than a third were non reusable.\nAs part of the project, textiles that come through the Bolton sorting centre are being scanned to find out the material composition.\nThe hope is that the results will work out how many of the garments could be recycled into new textiles or other uses - in order to ensure fewer clothes go to waste.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

        "article_text": "The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the country\nEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.\nAt the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.\nBy rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.\nA little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. It has proved controversial and, anecdotally, the perception is that it has been a retrograde step.\nWhile the aim was to create an accurate reflection of a golfer's ability to take on any course in the world, many players believe the system is easy to abuse for those wanting to fuel their egos with a low handicap or for those desiring a higher one to be more competitive.\nBut is that a true reflection of how it is or a myth?  Certainly, there is a different view among those who administer the WHS, compared with those grumbling over a post round pint.\nEx-motorcycle gang member reaches Open with win\n67 million to one - Whitnell hits two holes-in-one\nBoom or bust? Golf in flux but is it really thriving?\nIt is an issue that affects millions of golfers across the world and England Golf, the UK's biggest federation, believes the system is working. Furthermore, this is being reflected by the recreational game's increasing popularity.\n\"The reality was, certainly up to the launch of WHS (in November 2020), that there was a decrease every year over a 10-year period with regards to people wanting to play - the numbers of people that played in competitions and then consequently, the number of people that were actually having handicaps,\" Jeremy Tomlinson, England Golf's chief executive told BBC Sport.\nUnder the old CONGU system that prevailed in Great Britain and Ireland, handicaps were effectively determined by performances predominantly in club competitions.\nNow it is easier for regular social golf to count. This includes shorter rounds over nine holes, performances in head-to-head matchplay and while playing with a partner.\nGolfers are able to submit 'general play' scores from rounds with their friends, provided they have specified before teeing off that they want their game to count for handicap purposes.\nThis means more rounds count towards determining a players ability. The best eight scores from your 20 most recent rounds are averaged to provide what is known as a handicap index.\nThis figure is then transportable to any golf course and is used to calculate how many shots you can deduct from your total score. The harder the course, the more shots you receive to reflect the level of difficulty.\nBut the system works on a level of trust. Some players want the lowest possible handicap to help make them eligible for elite amateur events while others desire a few extra shots to help them win swanky competition prizes.\nHandicaps can now be as high as 54 (previously 36) and the average in England is 19. \"The game's gone soft,\" is a regular moan among diehard members.\n\"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"That's probably because the old system lent, we believe, a lot more to towards the lower handicapper.\n\"But of course, there are just more people who have come in.\n\"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete.\"\nThere are 722,000 golfers affiliated to England Golf through clubs and the number is continuing to rise. Since November 2020, 38m handicap scores have been submitted to the federation's central database, with 10m in the last year alone.\nPlayers do not have to be a member of a club to gain a handicap, and the Woodhall Spa based organisation offers it's iGolf app as a means for an ever growing number of more nomadic golfers.\n\"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.\nNevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions. \"Griping is a big word, but I think that those complaining are frustrated that it is different,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"Golf has become a lot more inclusive in providing the opportunity for different people to win, and especially when their handicap is on the way down, while they're getting into golf and getting better and better.\"\nTomlinson added: \"The handicapping system is about integrity. It is more transparent than it's ever been because it is about the scores that you do. But there is a need for check and challenge.\"\nSitting next to the England Golf boss, Flint nodded agreement. He said: \"There is sometimes this thought that, oh, let's just ban the higher handicappers from competitions because they're always winning it.\n\"It's a myth. Clubs can use the terms of competition and have categories, so everyone can play the competition from an inclusivity point of view. Have a prize for the low handicaps as well as mid and high handicapper.\"\nSeveral county unions are now insisting that more scores from competitions, rather than general play, are used to calculate low handicaps when determining eligibility for elite tournaments and representative teams.\n\"We reserve the right to be able to review any handicap that has more than four general play scorecards,\" Tomlinson insisted. \"We have denied players entrance to some of our championships because they've had too many general play cards.\"\nTomlinson insists the authorities, including the R&A and United States Golf Association who brought in WHS, are keen to further the probity of the mechanism.\n\"The R&A are just about to bring out a specification within the system which will identify where they think manipulation's happening,\" he said.\n\"It's another tool that the club handicap committee can use to address that issue. It's not 100%, but it's something that will help.\n\"Ultimately, any system - if people want to manipulate it, they will. It's not the system that's at fault, it's the individuals.\"\nTomlinson believes he is presiding over a growing recreational sport that profited from the bounce golf received by being the first sport people could play after the 2020 Covid pandemic lockdown.\nAs the nation shut down, hundreds of clubs in the UK feared for their future.  Tomlinson sat in emergency meetings across all British sports. \"We were inundated with clubs saying we're going to rack and ruin,\" he recalled.\n\"Amazing. From that point onwards, people were starting to think about their health. Golf clubs became inundated with people writing to them wanting membership, wanting to have playing rights.\n\"And I promise you that the back four weeks of that initial lockdown, I went to those meetings and I hardly said a word because I was watching in my sport compared to sports like swimming, athletics, even cricket that were suffering immeasurably because they weren't able to open up their facilities.\n\"We were building something, and by 13 May when we came out of that lockdown, we'd almost got to zero with regard to our concerns up and down the country because almost every golf club was reporting in that they were filling up.\n\"And of course, by the end of that year, they were pretty much full with waiting lists. That's what happened to golf from from the pandemic.\"\nTomlinson believes his sport, at a recreational level, has been left far healthier as a result. More people are playing at every level, whether on traditional courses or at driving ranges, in simulators or at crazy golf courses.\nHe wants to exploit this enthusiasm to grow the sport by creating pathways from these fringe versions to actual courses, club memberships and handicap competitions.\nDespite anecdotal grumblings, the figures stack up to suggest such movement is occurring. \"And that's brilliant,\" he said.\n\"And to those crusty old golfers; we still love them. We still want to take care of them, but we need them to be a bit more progressive in their thinking.\"",

'We love crusty old golfers but we want them to be a bit more progressive'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the countryIain CarterGolf correspondentPublished3 March 2025484 CommentsEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.At the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.By rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.A little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. \"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete. \"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said. \"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.Nevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions.",

        "article_text": "YouTube started out as an off-beat video sharing site. But at its 20th anniversary, the platform's content has fundamentally altered the way we think, feel and interact with each other.\nIn 2006, Time Magazine named its annual Person of the Year: you. \"Yes you,\" the magazine read. \"You control the Information Age. Welcome to your world.\" Its cover featured a mirror to reflect reader's image \u2013 emblazoned on a computer screen tuned to a site modelled after YouTube. It was just a year after YouTube's launch, but already, it had shifted our understanding of the role we would play in the coming era.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. It's gone from a novel tool to an unshakable pillar of technological infrastructure. Some 2.5 billion people log on every month. The company says people who watch YouTube on their TVs consume a billion hours of video a day, to say nothing of time spent on the app and website. But as much as YouTube changed how we use the internet, it's had an equally significant impact on our offline lives.\n\"Not long ago virtually no one took YouTube that seriously,\" journalist Mark Bergen writes in his book Like, Comment, Subscribe. \"But in so many ways, YouTube had set the stage for modern social media, making decisions throughout its history that shaped how attention, money, ideology, and everything else worked online.\"\nYouTube videos have occupied a massive share of our collective consciousness, dictating what brings us together, what drives us apart, what makes us laugh, cry and cringe. \"All the dynamics of social media \u2013 of attention, fame, disrupting old school media \u2013 have mostly grown because of the financial model YouTube built,\" Bergen tells the BBC. Human nature itself has shifted in the last 20 years, and as seen in these five videos, YouTube would become a nexus point for the way we see ourselves and each other.\nLong before the video stitching on TikTok or remixing on Instagram reels, there was Canon Rock, uploaded just 10 months after YouTube's founding. South Korean musician Jeong-Hyun Lim, known online as funtwo, sits in his bedroom with an electric guitar, his face hidden beneath a baseball cap and pixelated footage. A backing track plays the chords to Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D, and Lim joins in, his guitar work subdued in line with the 300-year-old piece. But Lim's playing \u00a0grows more intricate until, about 40 seconds in, he launches into a blazing solo, fingers gliding across the fretboard.\nThe reaction was explosive. As the video racked up hits, around 900 users sent direct video responses to Canon Rock \u2013 big numbers at a time when uploading videos meant plugging in a digital camera \u2013 and thousands more posted their own covers of the song. In 2007, YouTube user Impeto uploaded a compilation of dozens of Canon Rock videos edited into one continuous track, almost as though the whole internet was playing along together. Deft musicianship wasn't new to the web, but the user participation was.\nCanon Rock created a \"reciprocity between artists\" that opened the door for people to see each other as creative partners, says Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University in the US. By democratising the creative process, YouTube created a melting pot for different communities with different interests and skills to make the internet their own.\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our story on the YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know.\nIt helped inspire a new era of online collaboration, according to Jean Burgess, a digital media professor at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Videos like funtwo's weren't just a performance, Burgess says, they were an invitation, a \"showcasing of skill and the setting of standards for other players in the 'game' to attain or beat\".\nToday's video platforms bombard us with marketing partnerships and endless threads of political discourse. But the musicians behind Canon Rock represented a simpler time, where collaboration was not an economic or ideological proposition, but instead a space where online bedroom dwellers were learning to see each other as members of a global community, a project they were all embarking on together.\nEarly YouTube audiences will probably be familiar with the saga of Bree, better known by the username lonelygirl15. Her story began as a homeschooled girl posting simple videos about her daily life. But things took a bizarre turn when Bree discovered her family was involved with a strange religious cult. Over the weeks and months, the narrative grew more convoluted; Bree ultimately went on the run, investigating secret codes, eluding religious acolytes and fighting a sinister organisation.\nIt was all fiction, of course. But lonelygirl15's start was so mundane that many didn't question the story until the drama was too fantastic to ignore. \"Bree\" had an enigmatic realness \u2013 she was actively connecting with fans on MySpace and corresponding with journalists, and even the New York Times was still asking whether the series was truth or a hoax before the final episode. It sparked ferocious debate in online forums, with viewers picking apart everything from her narrative to the quality of her video production.\n\"[Lonelygirl15] seemed to captivate so many, drawing people who maybe didn\u2019t know what YouTube really was into the fold,\" says Duffy. \"The authenticity, the relatability, the vulnerability, the expressive sharing.\"\nBeyond satire, the series was a pointed effort to use the tropes and norms of social media to misguide the audience. It marked a major development on the internet, where some realised for the first time just how blurry the lines between fact and fiction had become, Duffy says.\nLonelygirl15 was a sea change for many users' relationships to each other, and it forced some people to examine the identities that they themselves were creating online, Bergen says. \"In some ways, the lonelygirl15 series was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"It was a clever commentary about the fact that authenticity doesn't really exist online \u2013 you're always a persona, even if you're not acting as one.\"\nIt raised questions about discerning truth on the web, and helped establish a new order where every post, no matter how innocuous, is subject to interrogation and distrust.\nIt's 2011. A young man sits in front of a map of the world. His hands and voice are shaky as he calls his father on the phone. The man is Randy Phillips, an airman in the US Air Force, and he is filming himself telling his dad that he is gay.\nPhillips ran a channel called \"AreYouSurprised\" detailing his life under the US's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy. In his previous videos, Phillips positioned the camera to keep his face just out of view, but hours after the 16-year policy was repealed, he was on full display. Phillips wasn't the only one. His post was an early example of the \"coming out\" video, a YouTube genre that became more and more influential as time went on.\n\"Watching real LGBTQ+ people share their own coming out journeys across platforms like YouTube definitely provided an opportunity for queer and transgender people all over the world to realise they were not alone,\" says Zach Eisenstein, director of communications at The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\u00a0\"When YouTube was just starting up, I was a teenager figuring out my own identity,\" he says. \"It helped me exponentially as I navigated my own coming out journey.\"\nThe offline world was in the throes of change. It would be four years until the US Supreme Court legalised gay marriage, but following a global economic recession that highlighted growing inequality and shifting political climates, social attitudes were becoming more inclusive.\nTyler Oakley, one of the first major openly gay personalities on the platform, launched the \"Coming Out\" challenge in 2011, encouraging his audience and fellow creators to proudly share their sexual orientations and experiences. YouTubers like Hannah Hart, Ingrid Nilsen and singer Troye Sivan garnered a collective 2.8 million views on their coming out videos. Olympic diver Tom Daley came out in a 2013 video, receiving support from his fans and fellow athletes.\n\"People find creators that speak to them, and very often watch them and get to know them and trust them and are influenced by them in a way that no other platform touches,\" says Ben Relles, former head of comedy at YouTube and cofounder of the YouTube channel Barely Political. The way we present ourselves differs between coworkers, family, friends and strangers, but YouTube circumvented those social links. LGBTQ+ creators leveraged the relationships \u00a0with their audiences to make it plain that people with different sexual identities did not just exist, they were no different than every other person.\n\"Through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the internet, social media has given people a unique ability to find safe and welcoming online communities \u2013 especially when they don\u2019t feel accepted in their in-person ones,\" Eisenstein says.\n\"This is for my 12-year-old self,\" begins Australian YouTuber Essena O'Neill in what she called her last ever YouTube video in 2015. Over the next 17 minutes, O'Neill broke down her decision to quit all social media and made a passionate plea to her followers to do the same. O'Neill's story took aim at the \"contrived\" reality of video and social media production, and its harmful effects on mental health. It was a sign of things to come.\n\"Running a channel is very much like running a treadmill,\" says Matt Koval, a filmmaker and YouTube's former head creator liaison. \"If you stop, if you get off the treadmill for a long period of time, your viewers are going to move on and start watching other people just by nature, and it can be difficult to come back.\" And many creators, even as far back as YouTube's early days, never did.\nQuitting videos have become a social media subgenre unto themselves in the past decade \u2013 people in the public eye realising that they've taken on too much, or that they need a break. But O'Neill's departure helped spark a broader conversation.\n\"People are so dismissive of influencers and creators,\" says Duffy. \"What creative workers experience really presages wider trends in the economy.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\nIt wasn't just creators facing burnout online. In the early days, social media was sold as utopian opportunity, a place where people would come together to share ideas beyond the constraints of traditional gatekeepers. But as time went by, a new discussion emerged about social media's potentially addictive qualities and negative effects on our time, attention and mental health.\nThanks in part to a push from creators like O'Neill, who offered their own experience as a model, conversations about our own relationships to the internet began to shift. Ten years later, we've reached the point the point that officials describe social media as a full on public health crisis \u2013 but that shift in thinking hasn't been enough to keep people off the internet. Social media usage on YouTube and elsewhere is higher than ever, and these days, O'Neill herself is back online.\nA spokesperson for Google, YouTube's parent company, says the platform works hard to ensure it's providing a healthy and fulfilling network, both for creators and users who just come to watch. \"Each YouTube creator has a different definition of success, and we have support mechanisms in place and continue to build a community that allows creators to thrive based on their individual needs and business aspirations,\" the spokesperson says. \"We want creators to make their videos in a healthy, sustainable way, and creating engaging content should always take priority over producing a certain quantity of videos.\" YouTube has invested in a number of efforts to promote mental health among its users and across the globe.\nMore people than ever were watching YouTube videos in the 2010s, with the site averaging one billion users a month by 2013, according to the company. But as YouTubers became more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, some of those feelings turned towards the platform itself.\nFor years, YouTube released an annual recap video looking back at the service's biggest cultural trends. What began as a one-and-a-half-minute round-up turned into big budget productions, bringing together a growing roster of notable creators and celebrities recreating viral moments set to remixed tracks of hit songs. It was a fairly well-received \u2013 until 2018.\nWithin a week, YouTube Rewind 2018 racked up over 10 million dislikes, making it the most-disliked YouTube post of all time. Critics panned the video, including the CEO of YouTube's own daughter, arguing the company was promoting a self-serving view of the platform geared towards its own corporate interests, one that glossed how people were actually using and responding to the service. \"The community, which was once celebrated by YouTube, no longer feels included in the culture YouTube wants to promote,\" reporter Julia Alexander wrote at the time. The speed and scope of the reaction was unlike anything the company had seen before.\n\"For a long time, YouTube has been pretty tolerant of its creators' and audiences' criticisms. I think that's the sort of atmosphere where it's totally permissible for the audience to get really mad at the company,\" says Bergen. But \"the company has never been great at reading the room\".\nDespite the criticism, YouTube maintains that it's an inclusive space built to allow its community to thrive and feel empowered. \"YouTube has not only democratized content, but democratized opportunity,\" a Google spokesperson says. \"At YouTube, we developed a comprehensive approach aimed to ensure we\u2019re a video streaming platform for high-quality content.\" That includes a set of robust community guidelines, the spokesperson says, one the company works to apply equally to all users in order to combat the spread of harmful content and build a healthy environment that lets users flourish.\nRewind 2018 revealed a festering hostility that grew in the online space. \"There was a marked shift,\" Duffy says. In the earliest days, discussions about YouTube centered around the idea that it promoted a culture of positivity. YouTube's original slogan was \"Broadcast Yourself\" \u2013 creators and users saw the website as a project they were all working on together. But as time wore on, an adversarial tone erupted on the platform, Duffy says, and many started to feel the YouTube they helped build had become too powerful.\nThe biggest change, perhaps, was how people understood the role they played on the platform; once they were creating YouTube, but now, they were just using it.\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

What are they thinking?\"\nHe also accused Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky of not wanting peace adding: \"America will not put up with it for much longer.\"\nFollowing a summit of western leaders over the weekend, the UK and France said they would produce a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be discussed with the US.\nAddressing MPs, Sir Keir said Britain would \"play a leading role\" in any agreed deal including, if necessary, deploying British troops in Ukraine to deter Russia from further attacks. \nTrump has so far not agreed to provide any security guarantees and has instead focused on a deal to open up Ukrainian minerals to US companies.\nHe has argued that the presence of American workers in the country would help discourage Russia from trying to encroach on Ukraine territory.\nAsked by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage if the minerals deal would provide \"enough of a security guarantee\", Sir Keir said the deal \"is not enough on its own\". \nThe prime minister received widespread backing from MPs across different parties, with Conservative former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly saying he had \"not put a foot wrong\" over the weekend. \nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she backed the PM's decision to fund an increase in defence spending by cutting the aid budget and added that she would support him to make further \"difficult choices - including on welfare\". \nSpeaking about the deployment of British troops, the prime minister said he did not take any such move \"lightly\" and promised MPs a vote if that happened. \nHe argued that backing Ukraine was not only \"the right thing to do\" but was also in British interests.\n\"If we do not achieve a lasting peace then the instability and insecurity that hits living standards of working people in Britain, that will only get worse and Putin's appetite for conflict and chaos, that will only grow.\"\nHe later said \"success was not guaranteed but I am not going to let up\". \nRussia has flatly rejected the idea of western troops being sent to Ukraine as part of any peace deal.\nSunday's summit in London came after an explosive spat between Trump and Zelensky at the White House last week.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump was \"no longer a reliable ally with respect to Russia\" and that it was time the UK reviewed its dependency on the US. \n\"I don't agree with him,\" replied Sir Keir, adding: \"The US and UK have the closest of relationships - our defence, security and intelligence are completely intertwined.\n\"A huge mistake at a time like this would be to suggest any weakening of that link is the way forward.\"\nLabour MP - and chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - Emily Thornberry questioned Sir Keir's decision to cut aid in order to bolster defence spending.\nShe said it was \"hard to believe\" there would be enough left in the budget to \"provide meaningful support\" and it could \"hobble\" the prime minister's attempt to show global leadership. \nAt the weekend, President Macron had suggested a partial, month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine, in which both would agree to a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure, but it would not cover ground fighting along the frontline in the east.\nEl\u00e9onore Caroit, a member of the French foreign affairs committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that President Macron's proposal sent a \"very strong message\" to Europe \"that if we want, we can do something\".\nBut Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC it was \"not a plan that we currently recognise\".\nHe added: \"Certainly there are a number of different options being discussed privately between the UK, France and our allies\u2026 What we are certainly doing is looking at what plan would bring peace as soon as we can, and what plan creates a lasting peace.\"\nThe prime minister hosted the London summit as allies scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.\nAt the summit, Sir Keir announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.\nThe plan involves including Ukraine in talks, continuing to supply it with military aid, boosting its defence capabilities and building a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal to end the fighting.\nThe UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under the proposals.\nBut apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.\nDefence Secretary John Healey will visit the US later this week to move discussions forward.\nIn other developments over the weekend:",

        "article_text": "Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says the writer's block she experienced after becoming pregnant with her first child was \"terrifying\".\n\"It's a really frightening place to be, because writing is the thing that gives me meaning,\" the acclaimed Nigerian author, 47, tells the BBC's Emma Barnett.\n\"I'm not sure that it was just entirely physiological but something changed, and I just could not get back into that magical place where I can write fiction.\"\nAdichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Last year, she had twin boys, now 11 months old.\nWhile she was pregnant, she had a \"very foggy feeling\" and \"couldn't think as clearly,\" she says.\n\"I'm a person for whom thinking clearly is so important, and so to be in that kind of place emotionally is very frightening,\" she says.\nAdichie is now releasing her first novel in more than a decade, Dream Count.\nThe book tells the story of four women navigating lives that aren't going to plan.\n\"I couldn't write for a while, and then I started writing again,\" she says.\nAdichie is known for work that explores themes including feminism, gender and immigration. The novelist's 2012 Ted Talk We Should All Be Feminists helped push her to greater prominence, and was even sampled by Beyonc\u00e9 on her 2013 song Flawless.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, she speaks about topics including parenthood, grief and artificial intelligence (AI).\nAdichie's beliefs about gender have led her to reflect on how she'd like to bring up her sons. \"I'm determined to raise good men,\" she says.\n\"I want to raise my boys to be emotionally comfortable, to be in touch with emotion, to not be afraid of emotion, and also to not be afraid of fear,\" she continues.\nCompared to girls, Adichie believes boys don't have many \"wholesome\" role models. \"This space is just occupied by noxious characters and ideas,\" she says.\nThe writer adds that she wants her sons to be \"the kind of boys that never start a fight but if you bring a fight to them, they will beat you up\".\nAs well as having her three children, since writing her last novel, Adichie has also lost both of her parents.\n\"Grief recedes but only in waves and then, at some point, it comes back,\" she says.\nAdichie was surprised by how physical grief felt. \"Your heart really is very heavy, you feel as though your body is somehow no longer able to carry the weight of your heart,\" she says.\nThe novelist says that grieving for her mother, who died suddenly on her father's birthday in 2021, had a role in shaping her new novel.\nWhen she started writing the book - after her mother died - \"I did not think I was writing about my mother,\" she says. But when she had nearly finished, she reread the manuscript and realised there was \"so much about mothers and daughters\" in it, even though she hadn't been conscious of this while writing.\n\"I felt very strongly that, in some ways, my mother had opened the door for me to get back into this magical place that means that I can write fiction,\" Adichie says. \"I kind of thought that she's comforting me, and it was actually deeply emotional for me to make that realisation.\"\nAs someone with a deep emotional connection to the creative process, it is perhaps unsurprising that when the conversation turns to AI, Adichie has a strong stance.\nThe author says that we should not refer to any written content produced by generative AI produces as stories and that the technology is going to make all of us, if we embrace it widely, \"increasingly stupid\".\nShe argues that AI could limit human creativity, something she says \"we should never think that we can somehow replace\".\nEven using AI for tasks like summarising work emails can be damaging, she says. \n\"The ability to summarise is something that requires a certain level of creativity and imagination and intelligence, and it just seems to me that if you're ceding that to something else, what are we going to let our brains do for us?\"\nWatch the full interview on BBC iPlayer - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: The Interview with Emma Barnett",

        "article_text": "YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to \"make India trade\".\nThe wildly popular financial influencer called herself the \"She-Wolf of the stock market\" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.\nLast month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain.\nThe regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education.\nIndia's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows.\nMany of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled \"investment gurus\" or \"financial influencers\" like Ms Patel, promising quick money.\nWith only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers.\nMost operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice.\nThe regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims.\nSebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes.\nThe regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration.\nSebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.\nAs markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.\nThousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals. \nSebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (\u00a310,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (\u00a39m) by selling courses.\nMs Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nWhile Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity.\nThe regulator has been both a \"selective\" and \"reluctant regulator\", Sucheta Dalal,  veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC.\n\"It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big.\"\nSumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy.\n\"Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation,\" he says.\nManish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed.\n\"Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken,\" Singh told the BBC.\nBalancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal. \nTechnology is inherently disruptive and the law is always \"playing catch-up\". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US.\n\"It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order,\" says Mr Agrawal. \nA Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations. \nThe challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.",

But why not in the future? \n\"People can say the Scottish league is a league of two teams, but it is a league of passion. Passion in football is everything.\n\"To play in empty stadiums and competitions where there is not that fire of the passion does not make any sense.\nRangers face big names of ambitious Fenerbahce - and Mourinho \nMourinho files lawsuit against Galatasaray\nRangers to face Fenerbahce in Europa League last 16\n\"Celtic and Rangers are two big clubs with incredible history also in Europe. I have lots of respect. They are big clubs with big fan bases, expectations. \n\"Celtic has a fantastic coach in Brendan [Rodgers]. Rangers has Ferguson now and I am not searching for a new job.\"\nMourinho is looking forward to facing Ferguson as the interim Ibrox boss prepares for his first European tie - and suggested his side have a tougher task than if Philippe Clement was still in charge.\nThe Belgian criticised Mourinho's style of football when the draw was made.\n\"I know his history as a football player for Scotland and for Rangers,\" the Portuguese said about the former captain of the national team.\n\"I don't know much about his career as a coach. I respect the emotional connection between him and his club. That is a very important thing, the connection between the fans and the coach.\n\"You can tell me he doesn't have much experience in Europe as a coach, but I prefer to go on the positive side.\n\"It will be much more difficult against him than the previous coach. The previous coach was more worried about philosophy. Ferguson will be more pragmatic. It will be hard for us but it will be hard for them.\"\n\nMourinho says Rangers fans still thank him for beating Celtic in the Uefa Cup final in 2003, when his Porto side won a thrilling game in Seville.\nIt was the Mourinho's first European final and 12 months later he led Porto to the Champions League title.\n\"It's true. Not so much here in Turkey, although maybe this week it will happen,\" he added. \n\"Especially in London, some Rangers fans come up to me. But of course that was a big final, my first European final.\n\"Part of my formation was in Scotland - I have friends blue and green.

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada, calling it a \"very dumb thing to do\" and vowed to conduct a \"relentless fight\" to protect its economy.\nTrump has imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.\nThe Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.\nBut Trump pushed even further in a post on Truth Social, saying: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nTrudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". \n\"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\"This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\"\nHe said that Canada's main goal remains to get the tariffs lifted so that they \"don't last a second longer than necessary\".\nTrump said he is protecting US jobs and manufacturing, and trying to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US president said his goal is to clamp down on the powerful opioid fentanyl; he has variously blamed the other countries for the drug's arrival in the US.\nResponding to the accusations, Trudeau said on Tuesday there was \"no justification\" for the new tariffs, because less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the US border comes from Canada. \nTrudeau's words were echoed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said there was \"no motive, no reason, no justification\" for Trump's move. Speaking on Tuesday, she too vowed to issue her own \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" - but said further details would be given on Sunday.\nTrump's tariffs are likely to push up prices for consumers in the US and abroad, said John Rogers, an economics professor at American International University.\nThe items most likely to be affected the soonest are food - the fruits, vegetables and other produce the US imports from Mexico - followed by the large amounts of oil and gas imported from Canada, Prof Rogers said.\n\"Prices could go up pretty soon\", Prof Rogers warned, though he was reluctant to say by exactly how much or how quickly. \n\"We are in pretty uncharted territory,\" he told the BBC.\nThe bigger concern for prof Rogers was the potential damage he said was being done to America's longstanding trade partners.\n\"This is kind of sticking your finger in the eye of your neighbour,\" he said, adding that, in a potential US-Canada-Mexico trade war, \"everybody is a loser\".\nThe three countries targeted are America's top trading partners, and the tit-for-tat measures also prompted fears of that very trade war. \n\"There's no way you can win a trade war. Everybody suffers, because everybody's just going to wind up paying higher prices and sacrificing quality,\" Prof Rogers said. \nTariffs are a tax on imports from other countries, designed to protect against cheaper competition from elsewhere, and boost businesses and jobs at home.\nCanada's retaliatory measures include a 25% reciprocal tariff that will be imposed on C$155bn (US$107bn; \u00a384bn) of American goods:\nCanada's Immigration Minister Marc Miller warned that as many as a million jobs in Canada were at risk if the tariffs were implemented, given how intertwined trade was between the two countries.\n\"We can't replace an economy that is responsible for 80% of our trade overnight and it's going to hurt,\" he said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency, a car manufacturing employee in the Canadian province of Ontario said people were indeed \"pretty scared\" of being laid off. \"I just bought my first house,\" Joel Soleski said. \"I might have to look for work elsewhere.\"\nThe sector is one that could be badly affected by the new tariffs regime in North America. Car parts may cross US-Canada border several times during the manufacturing process, and so might be taxed on multiple occasions.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto manufacturing industry, told reporters on Tuesday that he anticipates assembly plants will \"shut down on both sides of the border\" as a result of the tariffs.\nThe tariffs were called \"reckless\" by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whose president Candace Laing cautioned that the move would force both Canada and the US towards \"recession, job losses and economic disaster\".\nMs Laing warned they would also increase prices for Americans, and force US businesses to find alternate suppliers that she said \"are less reliable than Canadian ones\".\nCanadian provincial leaders have vowed their own responses. \nFord of Ontario mooted the possibility of cutting off Canadian electricity supplies and exports of high-grade nickel to the US, as well as putting an export levy of 25% on electricity sent to power homes in Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nCanada exports enough electricity to power some six million American homes.\nOntario and other provinces have also moved to remove US-made liquor off their shelves. In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said his province will ban American companies from bidding on provincial contracts, as will Ontario. \nFord also announced that a C$100m ($68m; \u00a355.1) contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet company Starlink will be cancelled.\nMeanwhile China - which now faces tariffs of 20% after Trump doubled an earlier levy - has vowed to fight any trade war to the \"bitter end\". It has announced its own counter-measures - including tariffs on a range of US agricultural and food products.",

        "article_text": "YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to \"make India trade\".\nThe wildly popular financial influencer called herself the \"She-Wolf of the stock market\" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.\nLast month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain.\nThe regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education.\nIndia's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows.\nMany of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled \"investment gurus\" or \"financial influencers\" like Ms Patel, promising quick money.\nWith only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers.\nMost operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice.\nThe regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims.\nSebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes.\nThe regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration.\nSebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.\nAs markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.\nThousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals. \nSebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (\u00a310,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (\u00a39m) by selling courses.\nMs Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nWhile Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity.\nThe regulator has been both a \"selective\" and \"reluctant regulator\", Sucheta Dalal,  veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC.\n\"It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big.\"\nSumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy.\n\"Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation,\" he says.\nManish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed.\n\"Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken,\" Singh told the BBC.\nBalancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal. \nTechnology is inherently disruptive and the law is always \"playing catch-up\". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US.\n\"It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order,\" says Mr Agrawal. \nA Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations. \nThe challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.",

        "article_text": "This year's show featured a bizarre James Bond tribute \u2013 while failing to duly honour visionary director David Lynch. That choice spoke to the awards' profound identity crisis.\nEarly on in Sunday's three-and-three-quarter hour Academy Awards ceremony, there was a tribute to the James Bond franchise, consisting of a Broadway dance routine from Margaret Qualley and three classic theme songs belted out by Lisa, Doja Cat and Raye. It was a strange segment, not just because no Bond films have been released in the past three years, but because the series' long-time custodians, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, have just handed over control of their family business to Amazon. Considering that so many of the evening's speeches praised cinema and the cinema-going experience, it was embarrassing that the Academy's 007 tribute coincided with the selling of one of cinema's most spectacular, big-screen-worthy assets to a streaming service.\nWouldn't a tribute to the late David Lynch have been more apposite? Lynch, who died in January, is regarded as one of modern American film's most singular visionaries \u2013 and he was a four-time Oscar nominee and an honorary Oscar winner to boot. Yet he merited just a few seconds in the In Memoriam montage. Later in the ceremony, though, there was time for a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, who is undoubtedly a legendary figure, but more in the music world than film. This sequence consisted of Queen Latifah's performance of Ease on Down the Road, a song from The Wiz (1978) which was produced but not written by Jones. With all due respect, do any film fans believe that The Wiz merits more attention than such Lynch masterpieces as The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive?\nPresumably the producers of the Oscars do \u2013 and that could be why the institution has such a profound identity crisis. Glance at the list of winners, and you'll see that this was probably the most radical celebration of innovative, low-budget cinema in Oscar history. And yet the cheesy and clich\u00e9d ceremony is lagging decades behind the tastes of its voters.\nThe biggest winners of the night were Anora and The Brutalist, two independent films made by auteurs with big ideas and tiny budgets. (Last year we had Barbenheimer. This year we had\u2026 Brutanora? The Anoralist? Maybe not.) Brady Corbet's defiantly serious period drama, The Brutalist, won the Oscars for score, cinematography and leading actor (Adrien Brody's rambling speech really should have had an interval, like the film itself). But the voters' favourite was Anora. Sean Baker's heart-tugging screwball tragicomedy won the Oscar for best picture as well as for director, original screenplay and editor \u2013 quite a haul for Baker, a boundary-pushing low-budget film-maker who did all three jobs himself.\nThe star of Anora, Mikey Madison, also won the best actress prize, making this an historic occasion in which two different Oscar acceptance speeches paid tribute to the sex worker community. The 25-year-old definitely deserved the Academy Award for her explosively dynamic yet sensitive performance, but she is almost a newcomer, so it was hard not to feel sorry for her closest rival, Demi Moore. In The Substance, Moore plays a middle-aged Hollywood actress who is usurped by her fresh-faced young doppelganger, so when Madison took to the stage to her accept her Oscar, and Moore was left in her seat, there was a cruel and eerie sense that the plot of The Substance was unfolding in real life.\nStill, The Substance won for make-up and hairstyling \u2013 not bad going for a delirious body-horror film from a French director. Jacques Audiard's trans gangster musical, Emilia Perez, won best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) and best song. And Walter Salles's political yet personal Brazilian drama, I'm Still Here, won best international film. There were technical awards for Dune: Part Two and Wicked, and an adapted screenplay prize for Conclave, but in most of the high-profile categories, this was an Oscars for the underdogs: an evening when leftfield artists like Baker won awards, and then spoke about the value of independent film-making and going to see films in cinemas.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The true-life history of The Brutalist\n \u2022 Why Emilia P\u00e9rez has caused upset in Mexico\n \u2022 The real meaning of the story of Wicked \u00a0\nKieran Culkin won best supporting actor for A Real Pain, as expected, and he swore in his acceptance speech, as expected. The best animated feature film was Flow, a cartoon made in Latvia using free, open-source software. And the best documentary feature was No Other Land, a documentary set on the occupied West Bank and made by an Israeli/Palestinian collective, which doesn't even have a US distributor. A few years ago, a film like Flow could never have toppled a Disney-Pixar cartoon as popular as Inside Out 2, but the Academy's drive to bring in a younger, more diverse set of voters is obviously having an effect.\nIf only the show had been affected, too. Instead, the proceedings could easily have been mistaken for a 1970s television variety show. The host was Conan O'Brien, following two years when Jimmy Kimmel was master of ceremonies, so that's three years in a row when the event took its self-satisfied tone from a late-night talk-show host delivering late-night talk-show wisecracks. O'Brien wasn't unfunny, exactly, and he made the odd sharply political comment, but essentially it was yet another evening in which a bored man in a bow tie made snide, roast-style jibes about films that deserve better. The Oscars are clearly in their \"safe pair of hands\" era when, in the wake of the notorious La La Land/ Moonlight envelope mix-up, and Will Smith's slapping of Chris Rock, the producers are intent on making everything as middle-of-the-road and predictable as possible. The show was slick and glitzy enough, with nothing actively obnoxious about it except for the insulting practice of cutting off the winners' speeches, while making time for O'Brien's skits. But the format is getting so tired that it's no longer fit for purpose.\nYou don't have to take my word for it. \"If you're still enjoying the show, you have something called Stockholm Syndrome,\" said O'Brien after about three hours. And if a show's host is joking about how much of an endurance test it is, then a major shake-up is required. What the ceremony needs now is even a fraction of the invention, daring and energy which are evident in the films it's honouring. Oscar winners have changed. Now it's time for Oscar night to change, too.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "The business of the North American Toy Fair, an annual showcase of the latest in silly putty, monster trucks and board games, is fun. But this year at the convention center in New York City, tariffs were killing the vibe.\nIn February, US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on products made in China by 10%. Then last week, with little warning, he announced an additional 10% border tax, which has now come into force on Tuesday, along with tariffs on Mexico and Canada. \nIn the toy industry, which estimates that about 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China, the rapid-fire announcements have stunned businesses, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to swallow a sudden 20% rise in cost.\nThe moves are the first of what Trump has threatened will be far wider action, making it a preview of the upheaval that could be coming for companies around the world.\n\"It's the first thing we talk about and the last thing we talk about,\" toymaker Jay Foreman said this weekend from his booth at the trade show, where classic hits such as Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and K'Nex were on display.\nHis business, Basic Fun!, makes 90% of its products in China and had been planning to counter the cost of the initial 10% tariff with a mix of higher prices for customers and lower profits, both for his firm and for his manufacturing partners. \nHe presented the strategy to his board on Wednesday, ahead of the toy show, only to have to rip it up the next day, after Trump's later announcement. \nHe will have to shoulder the tariff costs for products headed to stores this spring, he said, but is now expecting to raise prices for many items by at least 10% later in the year. \n\"The reality is that tariffs will raise the cost of toys for consumers,\" he said. \"If a customer says, 'Then I can't buy it', then I can't sell it, because I can't produce to lose money.\"\nTariffs are a tax on imports collected by the government at the border and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods.\nDuring Trump's first term, China was the main target of the measures, with more than $360bn worth of products sent to the US getting hit by the measures.\nAt the time, toys and many other consumer products were spared.\nBut Trump has now applied the duties across the board, hitting almost 15% of the imports into the US each year.\nHis actions have been overshadowed by tariffs on products made in Mexico and Canada - America's top two trade partners, which have long operated under a free trade agreement with the US. \nAnd they fall short of the \"up to 60%\" tariff that Trump called for on the campaign trail last year. \nBut with the latest move, businesses say the costs are getting too big to ignore.\nThe average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, with recent actions amounting to a rise roughly twice as large as the increase during Trump's first four-year term as president, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.\n\"10% - it's something we can somehow live with. 20% is a different ball game,\" said Yaron Barlev, chief operating officer of Clixo, a Brooklyn-based maker of magnetic building toys which started about five years ago and signed a deal last year to start selling its toys at Target later in 2025.\nWith manufacturing in China now under way to satisfy that order, his firm, which employs 18 people in the US, is expecting to have to shoulder the costs of the border duties, scrambling its plans for profits.  \nHe said he hoped Trump would offer some kind of reprieve for toys but was not feeling especially optimistic.\n\"It's much less predictable now than he used to be so I really don't know.\"\nTrump has said his actions will help boost manufacturing in the US, by making it less cost-effective to make products overseas. \nBut toymakers like Clixo, which had hoped to do its manufacturing in the US, say high costs and limited manufacturing capacity in the US make that idea unrealistic.\nMeanwhile, a string of weaker economic data has raised concerns that the uncertainty due to the tariff talk is starting to cause wider economic paralysis. \nBasic Fun!, which employs about 165 people and does roughly $200m in sales each year, had been looking to grow. But with the threat of tariffs bearing down, Mr Foreman recently put plans for acquisitions on hold, unsure how to calculate what a business would be worth in such a changeable environment. \n\"[A tariff] sounds good - 'Let's stick it to them!' But the ripple effect is unbelievable,\" Mr Foreman said.\nThe Toy Association, a business lobby group, says it is trying to make the case to the White House and Congress that toys should be exempt from tariffs, as they were before, warning that higher prices won't go unnoticed by a public already upset by the jump in prices in recent years.  \nPresident Greg Ahearn said his members are largely small businesses with profit margins barely as large as the tariffs that are getting under way. \n\"We think we have a very strong point to make and we're hoping they're going to be open to listening,\" he said. \nThe Toy Fair is his organisation's marquee event, drawing businesses from around the world who line New York's convention center with cheerful displays of blocks, high-contrast baby books and spiky coloured balls. But worry about tariffs pulsed through the gathering this year.\n\"It's killing our mojo,\" said Mr Ahearn, noting that it was his members' top concern.  \nFrom their booths, toymakers greeted questions about Trump's moves with head shakes, grimaces and disbelief. \n\"20% is a lot,\" said Ada Luo, sales director for Wonderful Party, a manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, which makes Christmas light necklaces, leis and New Year's hats. \"10% maybe... between the supplier and the buyer we can share, but 20%? We don't have a clue.\"",

I want everyone at home to believe what's possible. We've been through so much as a sport, so much effort goes on behind the scenes and we're in Las Vegas - it's exciting. We should enjoy and embrace it.\"\nLike being in a washing machine - England's tough night in Vegas\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nWigan impress in Las Vegas with win over Warrington\nAt the iconic Allegiant Stadium, one of the world's most impressive sporting arenas and home to NFL side the Las Vegas Raiders, Radlinski's Wigan put on a show befitting their tag as World Club Champions, soundly beating Warrington Wolves in the event's opening match. \nEngland Women suffered a record defeat in their historic international against Australia. \nThere were victories too for Canberra Raiders and Penrith Panthers in the NRL matches.\nBut for even the most loyal travelling fans and the broader game, this was about much more than results.\n\"This is what this is all about, the opportunity to put the game in a new global territory in front of new audiences while also giving the players and the fans new experiences,\" said Rhodri Jones, the managing director of RL Commerical and one of those charged with building the English rugby league brand.\nMore than 45,000 people attended the Allegiant Stadium during the course of the four games - an increase of around 5,000 on last season's two matches\n\"I think we've grasped the opportunity with both hands, I don't think we could have done any more. \n\"Hopefully people at home have seen this has been an unbelievable event and hopefully it will be even better next year. \n\"The number of ticket sales is better than last year so that tells you that we have collectively made an impact.\"\nBut where does the game go from here? A number of English clubs have already expressed an interest in playing in next year's event, which has now been confirmed as again featuring Super League sides. \nIt is fairly easy to see why. Future options include building the World Club Challenge into the programme and expanding the number of games.\nBut while this has all undoubtedly been an exciting new departure for the fans already engaged in the sport, what impact this will all have on rugby league's future as a truly global sport remains unclear. \nWhat is certain is that rugby league has entered a bold new era.\nWigan fans travelled to Las Vegas to watch their team beat Warrington\nWarrington half-back George Williams walks down the red carpet as he is introduced to fans",

        "article_text": "Douglas Adams's epic series of comic novels, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is loved by scientists and tech executives, including Elon Musk. In 1986, the author talked to the BBC about the unlikely origins of a wildly successful multimedia franchise.\nImagine waking up on what seems to be an ordinary morning on planet Earth, only to find out that the planet is scheduled to be demolished. That is where British writer Douglas Adams begins The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Over the next few decades, the story would take on a life of its own, spinning out into a sprawling franchise that now includes a bestselling book series, a television series, a feature film, stage shows, comic books and even a video game. It would also spark endless philosophical debates about the universe, and leave an indelible mark on pop culture. And it all began as a small BBC radio comedy.\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy revolves around the misadventures of Arthur Dent, an ordinary man from a sleepy English village who finds out that some bureaucratic aliens are about to obliterate the Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent and his friend, an alien-in-disguise named Ford Prefect, hitch a ride on a spaceship to escape the planet's destruction. Together with a motley crew comprising a two-headed space president, another Earth survivor and a depressed robot, they engage in hijinks across the galaxy while collecting research for an interplanetary encyclopedia, the eponymous Hitchhiker's Guide.\nWhile the story encompasses scientific intricacies and complex ideological layers, the idea of Hitchhiker's came to Adams in 1971 while he was \"lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck\", he told Terry Wogan on the latter's BBC chat show in 1986. Inebriated beneath the swirling stars, clutching a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to Europe, Adams decided that someone should devise a similar guidebook to the whole of the Milky Way.\nBy 1977, Adams had written for several radio shows, and was given the chance to pitch his own to the BBC. His first idea was for a six-episode anthology called The Ends of the Earth, in which each episode would have the Earth ending in a different way. Adams would eventually return to the idea of the guide as the story's focus. \"I never actually thought of myself as a science-fiction writer,\" he told Wogan. \"I thought myself primarily a comedy writer, and I became a science-fiction writer simply because I exaggerated so much.\"\nHitchhiker was the first radio comedy programme produced in stereo instead of in front of a live studio audience. The project was briefly listed as a radio drama, as the BBC only allowed dramas to be recorded in stereo. \"[Adams] knew the music, he knew the sound he wanted, he knew what the end of the world was going to sound like,\" producer Simon Brett told BBC Bookclub in 2000. Adams and Brett cast actors Simon Jones and Geoffrey McGivern as Dent and Prefect, with Peter Jones narrating the part of \"The Book\".\nThe programme was quietly launched late on a Wednesday night in March 1978, and received mixed reviews. One listener complained to the Radio Times, calling the episode \"fatuous, inane, childish, pointless, codswalloping drivel\". But it was also praised for its fascinating concept and its innovative and \"richly textured\" music and effects.\nBBC Enterprises turned down the chance to publish a novel based on the series, but Nick Webb, who was an editor at Pan Books, commissioned Adams to adapt his story. \"I thought [Hitchhiker's] was verbally witty and dexterous, and full of philosophical jokes \u2013 and I'm a sucker for philosophical jokes \u2013 but he had also a trick of sort of extrapolating something in a completely rational way, to a point of madness,\" Webb told BBC Bookclub. \"Then you would scratch your head and scratch your bum and think, 'Well, what exactly is the intellectual trick that has been played upon you?' Because inference-by-inference everything makes sense, but you get to a point of surreal absurdity.\"\nUltimately, Adams would write five Hitchhiker's books, along with two radio series and a television show. The franchise built a cult following \u2013 although its fans weren't always open about loving what was seen in the 1980s as an unfashionably geeky genre. \"People never like to admit it, actually,\" said Adams. \"Whenever I do book signing sessions\u2026 men come along and say, 'Would you sign this please, it's for my little boy?' And then you'd get little boys come along and say, 'Would you sign this please, it's for my father?'\"\nNonetheless, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy now has devotees all around the world, and the book has been translated into more than 30 languages. Dedicated fans celebrate Towel Day annually on 25 May as a tribute to Adams, who wrote: \"A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.\" In 1999, he founded a community forum called h2g2, also known as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition, where people could contribute entries to a real-time collection of titbits and vignettes about life on Earth.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nSome fans are drawn to Hitchhiker's particularly for its philosophical insights and applications to future technologies. Google's artificial intelligence research laboratory DeepMind was named in homage to Adams's Deep Thought, a supercomputer that, in the story, calculates the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. One of the series' best jokes is how unhelpful the answer is: it's the number 42.\nTesla founder Elon Musk has not been shy about his adoration for Adams, calling the writer the \"best philosopher ever\" and noting the story is \"so deep that people don't even understand\". The book helped the tech figure through an existential crisis as a teenager, he told journalist Alison van Diggelen in 2013. \"It highlighted an important point, which is that a lot of times the question is harder than the answer,\" he said. The story fuelled Musk's lofty ambitions for humanity's multiplanetary future, and in 2018 he launched a Tesla car into space with a copy of the novel in the glove compartment, and a sign on the dashboard featuring one of its key phrases: \"Don't panic!\" However, critics have argued that Musk misunderstands Adams' work, with Harvard historian Jill Lepore writing in The New Yorker that Hitchhiker's is a \"razor-sharp satiric indictment of imperialism\".\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Russia launched a giant space mirror\n\u2022 The classic novel rescued from the reject pile\n\u2022 The WW1 trauma that inspired The Lord of the Rings\nIn 2001, Adams died of a heart attack at the age of 49. At the time, he was working on the script for the first feature-length film of his story, which would be released posthumously in 2005. After Adams's death, the BBC commissioned four more series of the Hitchhiker's radio series. In 2009, author Eoin Colfer, with the support of Adams's estate, went on to pen a sixth book in the series, And Another Thing\u2026\nThe spirit of Adams's space comedy lives on in other forms of popular culture. Such motifs as the number 42 and \"Don't Panic\" can be found in various science-fiction works, including Doctor Who, Star Trek, Lost and The X-Files. The Hitchhiker's spirit lives on in technology, too, as Adams's fictional inventions continue to crop up in the real world. \"I'm not particularly worried about whether something you invent is actually going to happen or whatever,\" he said. \"I'm making fun of the people who are then going to use it.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine is ready to sign a deal with the US over his country's mineral deposits, days after he was told to leave the White House following a fiery exchange with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance. \nThe deal was expected to be signed during Zelensky's visit to Washington, but was put on hold after the meeting in front of journalists and TV cameras turned into a shouting match.\nThe relationship between the two leaders showed little sign of improving in the days afterwards, with the US announcing it was pausing all military aid to Ukraine. \nHours after that announcement, Zelensky posted a lengthy message on social media expressing his gratitude for American support for Ukraine, and saying his country was ready to sign the minerals deal at \"any time and in any convenient format\".\nIn a speech to Congress, Trump said he appreciated the message from Zelensky, but it is currently unclear if or when the deal will be signed.\nMultiple sources have told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the terms of the deal have not yet been finalised and could change from a previous version, which was published by Ukrainian media before Zelensky's meeting with Trump and Vance.  \nThat version of the deal envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction, which Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said would be managed by Kyiv and Washington on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the text, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nThe US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law, the agreement says.\nIn the days before the deal was supposed to be signed, disagreement over its terms formed part of a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but this demand was dropped from the version published online. \n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the US has given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nNo such guarantee has yet been made, although the published text says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nTrump has suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee, but responsibility for Ukraine's security would now fall to Europe. \nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump initially said Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals, but in the days after the spat in Washington he paused all US military aid to Ukraine. \nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at the meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead descended into a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is currently unclear when the deal might be signed.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's land mass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nBefore the deal was supposed to be signed, Vladimir Putin told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "This year's Oscars had it all - glamour, tears and the Wicked stars defying gravity. Here are some of the top moments from the biggest night in Hollywood.\nThere was an audible gasp from journalists in the winners' room when Mikey Madison was announced as the best actress winner. \nDemi Moore was the favourite for much of this campaign. Things did shift after Madison's Bafta win, but the race remained incredibly tight.\nIn the end, it was Madison's night. It marked an incredible moment for a 25-year-old actress who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nThe film tells the story of sex worker Anora, who has a whirlwind ill-fated romance with the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch.\nEdie Turquet, one of the young female dancers and strippers in the film, texted me to say it was \"insane\" that a film about sex workers could win best picture at the Oscars.\nShe added that she hoped it would \"shift or at least challenge\" perspectives of people towards her community.\nWe all knew it was coming but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande belting out Wicked's anthem Defying Gravity was even better than we could have hoped for.\nAs Erivo, in a white gown, hit that final iconic note, the audience stood in applause.\nThe co-stars performed a medley of songs, including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Grande sang to open the show wearing a gorgeous red sequined dress.\nEarlier in the night, Grande stunned on the red carpet with a champagne Schiaparelli gown, which leaned into her role as Glinda the Good Witch in the film.\n\"It's giving chandelier,\" one reporter said to me backstage.\nOn social media the big question was: \"How is she going to sit down in that dress?\"\nOn the red carpet, there was quite a moment when Halle Berry ran up to Adrien Brody and gave him a big kiss. \nIt recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.\nShe told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".\nSpeaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.\nThe Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".\nBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.\nInside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.\nReality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to... Brody.\nActor Adam Sandler was in on the ongoing jokes about his typically casual attire.\nEarly on in the night, host Conan O'Brien called him out, saying he was \"dressed like a guy playing video poker at 2am\".\n(For reference, Sandler was in the audience wearing a blue hoodie and shorts, an ensemble that looked more at home on the basketball court).\nFollowing a playful back and forth between the two, the actor walked into the aisle of the theatre and said he was \"leaving\" before going over to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and shouting his surname, in the way he previously did on Saturday Night Live.\nChalamet, ever good natured, laughed along.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, which killed 29 people. \nThe Grammys and Golden Globes both made the fires a central theme of the show.\nThe Academy Awards mentioned it only a handful of times, signalling Hollywood is moving on.\nThere was, however, one powerful moment, when O'Brien welcomed some of the firefighters who fought the blazes on stage. He called them \"heroes\", with the audience clapping and giving the emergency workers a standing ovation.\nO'Brien then said there are some jokes that even he isn't brave enough to tell - and asked some of the firefighters to read them out instead. \nLA Fire Captain Erik Scott read one joke off a teleprompter that said their hearts go out to everyone who lost their homes - including the makers of Joker 2.\nIt got a big laugh and O'Brien called it the best joke delivery of the night.\nIt was Zoe Salda\u00f1a's first Oscar, winning best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez - a musical about a transgender Mexican drug lord - and it marked one of the most powerful and emotional speeches of the night. \nShe broke down in tears immediately, crying out \"Mommy\", to her mother in the audience.\n\"I am floored by this honour,\" she wept, paying tribute to her fellow nominees for their \"loving and community\", saying \"I will pay it forward\".\nPraising the film's cast and crew, she got emotional as she talked about her family.\n\"Everything brave, outrageous and good I've ever done in my life is because of you,\" she said, praising her husband, his \"beautiful hair\" and their three sons.\n\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961 - I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands.\n\"I'm the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award and I know I won't be the last.\n\"Getting an award where I got to sing and speak in Spanish - this is for my grandmother.\"\nThe month-long saga to obtain a US visa by two Iranian filmmakers ended in the pair winning the best animated short film Academy Award - with them rushing to even make the ceremony in Hollywood. \nHossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani arrived at Los Angeles airport just hours before the Oscars award ceremony was due to begin.\nAfter their plane landed, they quickly changed outfits in a public restroom and made it with only moments to go before winning the award for their film, In the Shadow of the Cypress.\n\"It's not our fault we are so late,\" Sohani said to BBC News before the show. \"We couldn't get a visa. It's a difficult relationship\" between the US and Iran, she explained.\n\"Until yesterday we hadn't obtained our visa and now we are standing here with this statuette in our hands,\" said Molayemi in his acceptance speech.\n\"Speaking in front of this expectant audience is very hard for us,\" he added. \"Yes, if we preserve and remain faithful, miracles will happen.\"\nAs ever, politics reared its head during Sunday night's ceremony.\nHost O'Brien made a quip about how Anora was \"having a good night\", before saying: \"I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian.\"\nO'Brien must have been writing his monologue up to the very last minute, because the joke appeared to be a nod to the White House spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump.\nMeanwhile, the No Other Land documentary team descended on the red carpet wearing Palestinian scarves and Kufiya. Their film is set in the occupied West Bank. After they won for the film, the team took the stage and called out US policy in the region.\nKill Bill star Daryl Hannah also veered into politics while on stage. She referenced the war in Ukraine, saying \"Slava Ukraini\", the country's salute, as she presented an award.\nBut one person wasn't mentioned. \nHere in liberal Hollywood, you may have expected jokes and barbs toward Donald Trump - but his name didn't come up even once.",

It recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.She told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".Speaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.The Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".A Timoth\u00e9e and Kylie kissGetty ImagesBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.Inside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.Reality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to...

        "article_text": "Nicky Hayen's Club Brugge beat Aston Villa in the Champions League group stage this season\nAt the time it felt like a surprise appointment for semi-professional Haverfordwest County of the Cymru Premier.\nThree years on, and with the manager who joined them on New Year's Eve 2021 leading his current side into a Champions League knockout tie against Aston Villa, it seems scarcely believable.\nNicky Hayen was the first Belgian to manage in the Welsh Premier League and remains one of only a handful of non-British or non-Irish managers to do so.\nThe 44-year-old's ascent to the latter stages of Europe's top-tier competition with Club Brugge, who knocked out Europa League holders Atalanta in the play-offs, has been as rapid as it has been impressive.\nNow he is being touted as one of Europe's \"hottest properties\", and one pundit even suggested Hayen could be Arne Slot's replacement at Liverpool.\nFew of the 273 present at Bridge Meadow Stadium when Hayen recorded the biggest home win of his Haverfordwest tenure - a 6-1 thumping of Cefn Druids - would have predicted their manager would be in such conversation only a few years later.\nBut for Haverfordwest chairman Rob Edwards, who remains close friends with Hayen and shares regular messages with him, it comes as no surprise.\n\"The guy was a workaholic,\" recalls Edwards, whose house Hayen shared while living in west Wales.\n\"I would wake up at 8am and he'd be dressed, watching clips of opposition, doing analysis. I'd go to bed at 11pm and he'd be up, watching clips and doing analysis.\"\nClub Brugge took the lead before losing 3-1 at Manchester City in January\nHayen, a former defender who played more than 400 games in Belgium and the Netherlands, reached Wales largely via coaching, technical director and caretaker manager roles in Belgium and Saudi Arabia.\nHis major managerial breakthrough at Waasland-Beveren ended in Covid-impacted relegation to the Belgian second tier.\nHe connected with Edwards via a mutual contact in Belgium and, backed by a Uefa Pro Licence and stellar presentation, wowed the board during the interview stage. \n\"We just wanted to listen to every word he said,\" explains Edwards, who took over the club in 2020 and made Hayen his first managerial appointment the following year.\n\"We decided he was the person we wanted and did all we could to get him. Fortunately, he turned up.\"\nThe experience and professionalism Hayen brought to the part-timers had an immediate impact, taking them from second-bottom to the verge of the European play-offs in fewer than six months, implementing a possession-based, passing approach rarely witnessed in the Welsh top flight.\n\"You could see by the impact he had on the players,\" says Edwards. \"He didn't try to over-coach them - just give them very detailed stats about the opposition, very detailed analysis.\n\"He spent his time getting to know the players. He was very methodical. He asked about their welfare; he was worried about the mental side of the game as well.\n\"He managed to get a really amazing standard out of players we probably didn't realise had it in them.\n\"For me, it was a massive learning curve working with someone at that level, but he was very calm. He wasn't a shouter in the dressing room - he spoke and you listened.\n\"Despite not being the loudest, most aggressive, he had an aura - you just wanted to listen to him.\"\nIt is to Hayen's credit that he slipped seamlessly into life in the Pembrokeshire market town, despite having to leave his family in Belgium.\n\"There are 14,000 people who live in Haverfordwest. It's a beautiful part of the world but a bit of a culture shock,\" says Edwards.\n\"He wasn't really too concerned about what was around him. He was focused on the football. He embraced the culture and didn't try to change anything drastically. But he was just obsessed with football.\n\"He is a family man, doesn't drink, doesn't use social media. He just gets his head down. He deserves everything he gets.\"\nClub Brugge have won five of their 10 Champions League games this season\nEdwards knew the day would come, but he was hoping the club would get a little longer with Hayen at the helm.\nWhen, in the summer of 2022, an approach arrived from Club Brugge to take over their Under-23s, Club NXT, it proved impossible for Hayen to turn down.\n\"It was a little bit of a surprise,\" says Edwards. \"I wasn't expecting to have any dialogue with a club like Club Brugge.\"\nHayen stepped in as first-team assistant after Scott Parker was sacked in 2023, before getting his chance as interim manager when Ronny Deila left last March.\nThere, Hayen found former Sint-Truiden team-mate and ex-Liverpool and Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to confide in.\n\"When [Deila] stepped down with 10 games to go last season, Nicky stepped in and won nine of them and they came out of nowhere to win the league. That was a real statement,\" says Edwards.\nIt was during that run that Jan Mulder, the former Ajax and Anderlecht striker turned pundit, made a prediction for Hayen's future.\n\"Next year [he] will play a series of matches in the Champions League, attracting the attention of Madrid, Barcelona, \u200b\u200bBayern and Manchester,\" Mulder wrote in Humo, external in May 2024.\n\"Nasser Al-Khelaifi of Paris St-Germain also joins the fight for his signature at the last minute. Personally, I think that the great Nicky Hayen will replace Arne Slot from Zwolle as manager of Liverpool within two years.\"\nThe first part of Mulder's premonition has proven to be true - Hayen's Brugge beat Villa, Sporting and Sturm Graz in the group phase, as well as drawing with Juventus and Celtic.\nThe Belgian champions followed up by defeating Atalanta in both legs of their play-off for a 5-2 aggregate victory.\nPrior to that second leg in Italy, Hayen explained how before games he always talks to his mother, who passed away four years ago.\n\"What he has achieved in the Champions League is just incredible. Club Brugge over the years have had far better sides on paper, but he is getting an incredible tune out of them,\" says Edwards.\n\"He is a workaholic, fanatical and leads from the front. I guess that is why a lot of these younger players who are coming through are working so hard for him and having great success.\"\nHayen's brief tenure in Wales also set the platform for Haverfordwest's future. In 2023, under Tony Pennock, they qualified for Europe for the first time in 19 years and only the second time in their history, reaching the Europa Conference League second qualifying round.\n\"It's great for the club to be associated with someone like that,\" says Edwards. \n\"It seems like it is only the start for him. I would love for him to go on. I am sure there will be opportunities to manage even higher if he carries on.\n\"He is probably one of the hottest properties in Europe.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "This year's Oscars had it all - glamour, tears and the Wicked stars defying gravity. Here are some of the top moments from the biggest night in Hollywood.\nThere was an audible gasp from journalists in the winners' room when Mikey Madison was announced as the best actress winner. \nDemi Moore was the favourite for much of this campaign. Things did shift after Madison's Bafta win, but the race remained incredibly tight.\nIn the end, it was Madison's night. It marked an incredible moment for a 25-year-old actress who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nThe film tells the story of sex worker Anora, who has a whirlwind ill-fated romance with the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch.\nEdie Turquet, one of the young female dancers and strippers in the film, texted me to say it was \"insane\" that a film about sex workers could win best picture at the Oscars.\nShe added that she hoped it would \"shift or at least challenge\" perspectives of people towards her community.\nWe all knew it was coming but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande belting out Wicked's anthem Defying Gravity was even better than we could have hoped for.\nAs Erivo, in a white gown, hit that final iconic note, the audience stood in applause.\nThe co-stars performed a medley of songs, including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Grande sang to open the show wearing a gorgeous red sequined dress.\nEarlier in the night, Grande stunned on the red carpet with a champagne Schiaparelli gown, which leaned into her role as Glinda the Good Witch in the film.\n\"It's giving chandelier,\" one reporter said to me backstage.\nOn social media the big question was: \"How is she going to sit down in that dress?\"\nOn the red carpet, there was quite a moment when Halle Berry ran up to Adrien Brody and gave him a big kiss. \nIt recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.\nShe told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".\nSpeaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.\nThe Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".\nBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.\nInside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.\nReality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to... Brody.\nActor Adam Sandler was in on the ongoing jokes about his typically casual attire.\nEarly on in the night, host Conan O'Brien called him out, saying he was \"dressed like a guy playing video poker at 2am\".\n(For reference, Sandler was in the audience wearing a blue hoodie and shorts, an ensemble that looked more at home on the basketball court).\nFollowing a playful back and forth between the two, the actor walked into the aisle of the theatre and said he was \"leaving\" before going over to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and shouting his surname, in the way he previously did on Saturday Night Live.\nChalamet, ever good natured, laughed along.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, which killed 29 people. \nThe Grammys and Golden Globes both made the fires a central theme of the show.\nThe Academy Awards mentioned it only a handful of times, signalling Hollywood is moving on.\nThere was, however, one powerful moment, when O'Brien welcomed some of the firefighters who fought the blazes on stage.

        "summary": "\"'We couldn't get a visa'Getty ImagesThe month-long saga to obtain a US visa by two Iranian filmmakers ended in the pair winning the best animated short film Academy Award - with them rushing to even make the ceremony in Hollywood. It marked an incredible moment for a 25-year-old actress who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.This is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.The sex workers at the heart of AnoraThe film tells the story of sex worker Anora, who has a whirlwind ill-fated romance with the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch.Edie Turquet, one of the young female dancers and strippers in the film, texted me to say it was \"insane\" that a film about sex workers could win best picture at the Oscars.She added that she hoped it would \"shift or at least challenge\" perspectives of people towards her community.LIVE: Follow BBC coverage of the ceremonyRECAP: How the Oscars unfolded this yearWATCH: Highlights of the show in 180 secondsFASHION: See the best looks from the red carpetWINNERS: Full list of tonight's awardeesMORE: How to watch the winning filmsCynthia and Ariana defy gravityGetty ImagesWe all knew it was coming but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande belting out Wicked's anthem Defying Gravity was even better than we could have hoped for.As Erivo, in a white gown, hit that final iconic note, the audience stood in applause.The co-stars performed a medley of songs, including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Grande sang to open the show wearing a gorgeous red sequined dress.Getty ImagesEarlier in the night, Grande stunned on the red carpet with a champagne Schiaparelli gown, which leaned into her role as Glinda the Good Witch in the film. It recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.She told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".Speaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.The Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".A Timoth\u00e9e and Kylie kissGetty ImagesBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.Inside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.Reality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to...

        "article_text": "A magnitude 3.9 earthquake has hit Hollywood as some of the globe's top stars began celebrating after the Oscars. \nThe earthquake's epicentre was measured in North Hollywood, just miles from where the awards ceremony was hosted at the Dolby Theatre. \nThere were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The quake struck shortly after 22:00 local time as celebrities were gathering at the popular Vanity Fair afterparty. \nThose in the area reported a sudden jolt of energy, with some screaming and seeing high-rise buildings wobbling like jelly. \nThe US Geological Survey (USGS), which tracks such events, said the earthquake was felt miles across Los Angeles. \nThere was no tsunami alert issued as a result of the relatively minor earthquake.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department said that the earthquake was felt across downtown Los Angeles but the agency was not entering into \"Earthquake Mode\" over the incident. \nFor stronger earthquakes, first responders and officials do assessments of the area to ensure there is no structural damage to buildings and infrastructure. \nThe quake is among about 40 that have hit Southern California since the start of March - though nearly all of these were magnitude 1 earthquakes that aren't typically felt by residents, according to USGS data reviewed by the BBC. \nLast month, there was a magnitude 3.7 earthquake that struck the nearby Malibu area. In December, a strong magnitude 7 earthquake jolted northern California and caused a short tsunami alert for those in northern California and southern Oregon. \nBBC correspondents covering the Academy Awards in the heart of Hollywood reported fierce shaking and even some screams as the sudden jolt scared visitors. To some, it sounded like a bomb went off with the rumble. \nOne resident called it the biggest earthquake she'd felt and was surprised it was only a magnitude 3.9. \"I felt that in my bones,\" she remarked. \nThe BBC's Emma Vardy said she was retouching her makeup for some final Oscars filming when the quake struck. Her diamond earrings wobbled in the mirror and she realized the high-rise she was in was shaking.  \n\"I have felt a lot of quakes over the past two years in Los Angeles but currently, I am on the 15th floor of our media centre in Hollywood,\" she remarked. \"Feeling a building of that size move around like jelly is quite an experience.\" \nSam Granville and Emma Vardy contributed to this report.",

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who plays a New York stripper.\nSince publication of this article, Anora won best picture at the Oscars and Madison won best actress.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

        "article_text": "Since her debut in the 1976 remake of King Kong, Jessica Lange has never shied away from hard work.\nA double Oscar winner for 1982's Tootsie, and 1994's Blue Sky, she's starred in roles as eclectic as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Cape Fear, Rob Roy, Big Fish and Broken Flowers.\nOn television she played Joan Crawford in Feud, took home an Emmy for Grey Gardens and a stash of awards for one of the many roles she played in the American Horror Story franchise.\nBut she's also a familiar figure on the stage \u2013 in London and on Broadway \u2013 where she's appeared in classics A Streetcar Named Desire, The Glass Menagerie and Mother Play.\nAnd it's that ability to cross between stage and screen, classic plays and pulp fiction, which means that everything she attaches herself to is guaranteed a loyal audience.\nHer latest film is an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. The Pulitzer Prize winning play was written in 1940 but not staged until after O'Neill's death in 1956.\nA semi-autobiographical work dedicated to his wife, O'Neill described it as \"play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\"\n\"It has not been an easy project to get off the ground,\" Lange admits.\n\"This is a throwback to another kind of filmmaking and another kind of storytelling but in my mind this is the greatest American play ever written.\n\"It has this universality, this emotional depth. You'd be hard pressed not to relate to something in it, especially in the world we live in now.\"\nShe plays Mary Tyrone, the matriarch of an American family who's addicted to morphine since the birth of her sons, who struggles with loneliness and fears about her boys' health.\n\"Mary Tyrone is one of these parts which mean the world to me,\" says Lange.\n\"It may sound corny but I love her. It's thrilling as an actor to have a part like this.\"\nShe's played the role twice before on stage and it's the 2016 Broadway version, directed by Jonathan Kent, which has been brought to the screen. \nFilming wrapped in 2022 but it's only now that Lange and co-star Ed Harris have been able to premiere it in Dublin and Glasgow.\nShe arrived at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday just as Tim Roth, who appeared in the opening film Tornado, departed.\nThe two actors were in the 1995 film Rob Roy, she as Mary McGregor, wife of Liam Neeson's Rob Roy, and he as the villainous Archibald Cunningham.\nAnd while Roth's abiding memories were of his war with the Highland midgie, Lange recalls a much more pleasant experience.\n\"It was such a marvellous time, up in the Highlands where I'd never spent time before and it was extraordinarily beautiful,\" she says.\n\"I had the whole family here and the kids had a whole life of their own going on.\n\"It was a very special time and I liked the film.

New Zealand are a very good side but we played perfect cricket today.\n\"In such a short tournament you have to try and win every game that's in front of you. Australia have a rich history but it's about us.\"\nNew Zealand captain Mitchell Santner: \"It was a slower wicket than what we have come up against but we knew that coming in.\n\"If you had said we'd have to get 250, we'd have been happy. It spun more than we thought but their four quality spinners makes it pretty tough.\"\nFormer New Zealand wicketkeeper Katey Martin on BBC Test Match Special: \"New Zealand looked clueless against the spin and it was a challenging innings for Kane Williamson.\n\"It felt like they never got out of gear.

The S&P 500 closed 1.2% lower.\nAmerican retailers and carmakers were among the hardest hit, with electronics chain Best Buy's share price closing more than 13% lower.\nThe company had warned earlier on Tuesday that the tariffs would lead to higher prices for its shoppers. \n\"The giant wildcard obviously is how the consumers are going to react to the price increases in light of a lot of price increases potentially throughout the year,\" said Best Buy's chief financial officer Matt Bilunas.\nTrump said he was imposing the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in response to what he said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US.\nTrudeau called that justification \"completely bogus\" and warned that Canada's retaliatory measures would hurt. \nHe said Canada would first hit $30bn worth of products, and target the remaining $125bn over 21 days.\nAny fresh duties Canada imposes will be in place \"until the US trade action is withdrawn\", he said.\n\"Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight, not when our country and the wellbeing of every one in it is at stake,\" he said.\nAddressing Trump directly, he added: \"Donald, you're a very smart guy. But this is a very dumb thing to do.\"\nChina also swiftly announced its own counter-measures, which include 10-15% tariffs on some US agricultural goods including wheat, corn, beef and soybeans. China is the US's biggest buyer of these goods.\n\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.\nTrump said he would respond to retaliation with a plan, due in April, for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nThese would be tailor-made to each country and take into account areas such as the trade balance with the US and other taxes, such as VAT.\nTrump has also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on the EU, recently claiming that the bloc had been \"formed to screw the United States\".\nEurope has pledged to hit back, but no tariffs have been implemented yet.\nTrump is hoping that imposing tariffs on the goods that the US buys will force foreign companies to invest in America, boost tax revenues and grow the economy.\nHe has argued the tariffs - which are a tax paid by the business importing the product - will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs as foreign companies switch to production in America. \nBut tariffs also tend to trigger retaliation from targeted countries, disadvantaging domestic businesses looking to export goods, meaning the measures can ultimately hold back trade.\nAnalysts have warned that tariffs could lead to economic recessions, push up prices for US households and could also have a knock-on effect on consumers across the world, including in the UK.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said that regardless of whether the UK avoids tariffs, they will have a knock-on effect.\n\"I don't think it serves anyone well,\" she said. \"And it's absolutely the case that even if tariffs aren't applied to the UK, we will be affected by slowing global trade, by a slower [economic] growth and by higher inflation than otherwise would be the case.\"\nIf inflation rises, it could affect the pace at which interest rates are cut.\nCompanies could choose to absorb the cost of the extra tax. Chipotle said that the restaurant chain would take that route - for now.\n\"It is our intent today to hold pricing constant because we don't know if the tariffs are transitory, if they're going to be permanent, or how they will impact our business in the future,\" said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's corporate affairs chief.\nBut, like Best Buy, other US retailers warned that prices would rise. \nTarget's boss Brian Cornell said shoppers were likely to see increases over the next couple of days for foods such as avocados, bananas and strawberries.\nMexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US market each year.\nWalmart said it would try to keep prices \"as low as possible\".\n\"In the meantime, we encourage all parties to work towards finding common ground that will protect consumers from price hikes and continue to grow our economy,\" it said.\nCarmakers are also bracing for a hit.\nFord chief executive Jim Farley warned last month the business \"could handle two weeks of tariffs\".\nHe told Bloomberg: \"We could see billions of billions of dollars of pressure on the industry, lost jobs, lots of impacts to communities.\"",

        "article_text": "Are you warm, cool or neutral? How the retro trend of \"getting your colours done\" made a comeback with personalised colour analysis on social media \u2013 and how your perfect colours can \"spark careers, conversations and connections\".\nDo you have cool or medium undertones? Does red brighten your skin or dull you down?\u00a0Questions like these, that may not have crossed your mind before, are now prominent on social media, as users try to define their colour palettes.\u00a0Colour analysis, once considered niche, has seen a surge in popularity, with appointments booked months in advance and apps including TikTok and Instagram flooded with tutorials on how to determine which colours suit you.\u00a0\n\"Before I started offering online consultations, I had people fly in from around the world to see me,\" says Canadian image consultant and colour analyst Carol Brailey.\u00a0\nSince Brailey launched her business back in 2012, and has done thousands of consultations. \"It appeals to people from all walks of life,\" she tells the BBC. \"There's everyone from 17-year-olds to those in their 70s \u2013 I find people are tired of gravitating towards black clothing.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nOn TikTok, Brailey's client transformations have gained millions of views, as has the hashtag #ColorAnalysis, which is often accompanied by filters allowing users to find their palette. But although this technology is new, the practice has been around for decades.\u00a0\u00a0\nColour analysis enjoyed a spell of popularity in the 1980s and early-90s, when \"getting your colours done\" meant visiting a professional colour consultant in person, and being assigned a particular set of hues \u2013 often based on a system of seasons \u2013 that suited you. Broadly speaking, spring meant bright and fresh colours, summer cool and light, autumn was burnt oranges and mossy greens, and winter was deep jewel tones. This surge in interest was largely thanks to the bestselling books Color Me Beautiful by Carole Jackson (which sold more than 13 million copies worldwide) and Color Me a Season by Bernice Kentner.\nHowever, it was in the early-1900s that seasonal colour theory was born in the studio of Johannes Itten, a Swiss painter and art professor. Itten noticed that some of his students' portraits looked more vibrant than others, a difference he attributed to colour. By analysing colours that \"harmonised\" well together, he developed the seasonal analysis tool still used today, grouping people into summer, autumn, winter or spring.\u00a0\nBrailey puts the modern-day revival down to how visual we have become. \"Whether it's uploading Instagram pictures, recording TikTok content, or even Zoom meetings, we have become a very visual society.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter her consultations, it's not unusual to see tears, she says. \"People cry because they've never seen themselves look so vibrant. In my years of being in the industry, I have witnessed people's lives change, with promotions and new jobs, because it starts a confidence boost.\"\u00a0\nTabitha Lofts didn't cry after her colour consultation, but she did opt to have a total makeover, dyeing her hair, switching up her make-up routine, and introducing colours to her wardrobe that she hadn't previously worn.\u00a0\"I did the whole shebang\", she laughs, adding, \"I liked it, and I felt so different.\" Before her consultation, Tabitha thought she had a warm spring or summer palette, explaining, \"I was so sure that I was warm toned, because I burn in the Sun, but it was the complete opposite.\u00a0I learnt I'm cool toned, suit silver jewellery, and my favourite colours weren't my colours at all. Now I wear lots of cobalt blue, a shade I'd never worn before.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n- How one surprising image kick-started the 90s\n- How to transform your home with art\n- How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\nFor Lofts, who is a nutritionist and content creator, colour analysis was a way of building confidence.\u00a0\"I was quitting fake tan, as I was addicted, and relied on it to bring my outfits together,\" she says. \"It was confidence in a bottle, but I need to find it elsewhere.\" She described getting dressed and not \"understanding\" her skin tone, which is where she got the idea for the image consultation.\u00a0\"The results really changed my mind about my pale skin. I used to think about it with negative connotations and assumed it made me look icy, but now I know I can be warm, even without warm visuals.\"\u00a0\nTo those who are dismissive of colour analysis, Lofts admits it is not the be all and end all. \"Although I got a lot from it, I still wear colours that aren't in my palette. It's not a prescription.\"\u00a0\nGrowing up in Costa Rica, fashion designer and stylist Micah Lumsden has always gravitated towards bright colours, as she finds that wearing them lifts her mood. But it was an experience while at fashion school that made her want to better understand colour theory.\u00a0\"We were studying colour analysis, and my skin tone wasn't understood by my teachers. I got several back-up consultations from other students, but there were so many misconceptions about dark skin,\" she tells the BBC. \"Comments like, 'Every black person looks good in red,' as well as the idea that 'those with darker skin look good in every colour'.\"\u00a0\nIt was this lack of awareness that prompted Lumsden to launch styling consultancy Cocoa Styling. \"I started working with painters and make-up artists, the people who really understand colour theory.\"\u00a0She now has clients around the world, and has noticed more male clients on her books. \"Guys do care about fashion,\" she says. \"I used to see one man per 10 clients, but now it's one per five.\"\u00a0\nAs a stylist, she approaches wardrobes with colour at the forefront, rather than design. \"Most people will look good in a tailored blazer and T-shirt, but the personalisation of colour gives an outfit a special touch.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nColour analysis is often expensive, but Lumsden doesn't want that to be a deterrent. She's also sceptical of online colour-analysis filters being the answer. \"It's hard to give an unbiased reading of filters, and screens also reflect light.\"\nInstead, she suggests holding up items from around the home against your face, or going to a local craft store to buy felt patches. \"You can use blankets, cushions... whatever. Hold them up against your face in the mirror, and take a selfie. Once you've got a collection of selfies, place them next to each other and ask, do I look better with blue and purples? Or yellows and oranges? If it's the latter, you have a warm palette, if it's the former, you're probably cool.\"\u00a0\nWe know fashion runs in cycles, but many believe that knowing your personal palette could be a way to break up with fast fashion. \"Trends rotate so quickly, so knowing your best colours is a great way of harnessing what suits you and eliminating everything else,\" Ellie Richards tells the BBC. She's the founder of Nuude Studio in Queenstown, New Zealand, and approaches fashion through psychology. Colour, in her opinion, is the most important tool.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There is a science to clothes changing your mood, your behaviour and people's perception of you,\" she says. \"When you put on a colour that suits you, it's a powerful tool, because we're instantly more confident and aligned in personal identity.\"\u00a0\nThe easiest way to see colour psychology in action, she says, is in films and TV series. \"If we look at Euphoria, for example, Cassie (played by Sydney Sweeney) is often dressed in light blue to show an angel-like innocence, whereas Maddy (played by Alexa Demie) dresses in more dark maroon tones to signify her influence.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nLook at some of the trending colours of 2025, and black doesn't feature. Instead, we're seeing bold cardinal reds, striking marigolds and dusty-rose pinks. According to Richards, we've entered an era of being \"bold\".\u00a0\n\"The pandemic days of wearing grey sweats are over, and instead we've emerged seeking fun, playful looks.\" She cites social media as influencing our style, too. \"It's had a massive effect. On TikTok, creators need to stand out and they can do so by wearing bright, eye-catching colours. Those videos are seen by millions of people, and so it's normalised these bold looks.\"\nRichards is passionate about the benefits of colour analysis. \"A deep understanding of personal style and colour can spark careers, conversations and connections,\" she says, acknowledging that it can be a little daunting at first, but advising the curious to start by adding colour little by little.\u00a0\"One option is to wear muted shades of a colour, or accessories.\"\nDespite a colour consultation confirming that cobalt blue suits her best, Lofts still gravitates towards black. \"It's easy to wear,\" she says with a smile. \"But I'm trying to be more adventurous.\"\nAs a personal trainer, she sees plenty of online content pushing \"optimisation\" and \"being the best version of yourself\". She views colour analysis as part of that trend, but believes the most important thing is feeling comfortable in your own skin. \"Everyone is focused on self-improvement, and there's a vanity to it,\" she says. \"But it doesn't have to be serious. Experimenting with colour should be fun, playful, and free from judgement.\" She laughs. \"Even if you don't stick to your assigned palette.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The recently opened Pekoe Trail, which runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history.\nThe sun is bright and harsh on my face when I stop to admire the view \u2013 okay, to catch my breath \u2013 at the top of the steep path. How is it that just 20 minutes ago, the skies were grey and moody with the threat of an imminent downpour? In Sri Lanka's central highlands, the weather may be capricious but what remains unchanged is the sprawling expanse of tea estates in every direction.\u00a0\nThis region is where the bulk of soothing Ceylon tea comes from. And the recently opened Pekoe Trail, Sri Lanka's first long-distance hiking trail that runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history. This hiking trail, divided into 22 stages, begins in Sri Lanka's second largest city of Kandy, close to the area where Scotsman James Taylor first planted tea in the country in the mid-1800s. After a long and circuitous route, it finally ends in the hill town of Nuwara Eliya, whose cool climes and misty slopes are said to have reminded the British colonisers of Blighty (Britain).\u00a0\nThe trail has existed in patches since those initial days of tea cultivation in Sri Lanka, beginning as basic mud tracks that were used to transport the leaves to factories and then onward to domestic markets and Colombo port for export. For Pekoe Trail founder and sustainable tourism consultant Miguel Cunat, creating this multi-stage, multi-day hike was a labour of love, involving nearly 10 years of research and exploration.\n\"My initial objective was to promote Sri Lanka as a world-class hiking destination,\" says the Spaniard and long-time Sri Lanka resident, who was keen to put the small island back on the tourism map after a disastrous spell with Covid and the subsequent economic crisis. His efforts came to fruition with the official opening of the Pekoe Trail in late 2023, with initial funding from the European Union and USAID.\n\"The trails are fairly easy, at low elevation and open all through the year. In that sense, this hike is for everyone,\" he explains. That means everyone, including novice hikers such as myself, have the option to stay in a hotel near the trail and go out on exploratory day hikes within a single stage. I also come to understand later from my trail guides that most visitors choose to do this instead of attempting the trail in its entirety.\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nAnd although tea is the common thread stitching this story together, each stage has its own unique elements \u2013 a colonial-era cricket club here, a seasonal waterfall there, statues of brightly coloured village deities, Anglican churches with brilliant stained-glass windows, distant views of a sharp peak or clusters of wildflowers blooming in the midst of a barren stretch. Cathy Cruse, a 62-year-old Australian hiker who recently set a record by completing the entire trail in seven days, agrees, saying, \"You've got the tea plantations and then you're going into thick jungle and then pine forests, and then at one stage I thought I was walking through Australia, with all the tall eucalyptus trees.\"\nCunat's objective was also to bring tourist attention and money into the hinterlands and hill towns located away from the popular coastal destinations of Sri Lanka's south or the Buddhist Cultural Triangle of Anuradhapura, Sigiriya and Dambulla. Cruse, who is married to a Sri Lankan, says that she has visited Kandy and Nuwara Eliya several times but never had a chance \u2013 or indeed, a reason \u2013 to explore the more interior parts of the tea country.\nAs Cunat walked along the various trails, he also began to see a larger picture emerging from the network of villages and communities along the way. \"Along with nature, there is so much history and living heritage, with local fairs and festivals, and opportunities to see how [rural Sri Lankans] live and work,\" he says. And it is this aspect I most enjoy about my hikes \u2013 I am never too far from civilisation, be it a local temple or a tea factory, and I get to have regular interactions with friendly plantation workers and curious children everywhere. It is perhaps why Cruse stresses how safe the trail is for solo or women hikers. \"When I pick a trail, I'm looking for somewhere safe that a woman can tackle on her own and not feel intimidated. Not once did I ever feel nervous of my surroundings or my guides on the Pekoe Trail,\" she says.\nThe history of tea in Sri Lanka is inextricably linked with the Indian-Tamil plantation workers brought by the British. Their descendants \u2013 mostly women \u2013 still form the backbone of the lowest levels of tea production. Dressed in frayed button-down shirts and thick long skirts to protect from leeches, they spend their lives picking the finest leaves from the bushes. I see them walking up and down the tea estates, their hands nimble with years of practice, their necks bent with the load of the bamboo baskets tied to their heads, into which they carefully toss the leaves.\nThe best of 2025\nSri Lanka was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.\u00a0See the full list here.\nThe women beam in delight when I speak to them in Tamil. \"Tell me about India,\" third-generation tea picker Sathyavathy demands, when I stop to chat with her group during their mid-morning tea break in the Bogawantalawa area, known as the \"Golden Valley\" due to its fine quality of tea. \"Is it beautiful?\" Like many of her peers, she has distant family back in the small towns of Tamil Nadu in South India but has never visited the country.\nMy initial hikes take me through stages seven and eight near Hatton in the heart of the tea country, dotted with old factories that still process tea using dated technology, and boutique hotels repurposed from massive bungalows once meant for estate managers. My guide here is Dharsharuban Rathnasingham, a young man whose grandparents and mother used to work in these very tea plantations.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 The rise of the slow swimming holiday\n\u2022\u00a0 A hike through history on Britain's oldest road\n\u2022\u00a0 Sri Lanka's most beautiful train journey\nRuban \u2013 as he likes being called \u2013 is passionate about sharing the stories of his people, Indian Tamils who populate the villages and towns around the various stages of the Pekoe Trail. As we walk, he stops to point out the elements distinctive to tea plantation life, like the \"line rooms\", cramped barrack-style quarters where large families lived together (and still do, in some places); and the statues of fierce Tamil protector deities placed at major crossroads or beneath trees, often depicted riding a horse or wielding a scythe.\nFrom Hatton, I take the famed Colombo to Badulla train to Ella, from where I attempt to tackle stages 15 and 16 over the next several days, taking in the viewpoint known as Ella Rock and the picturesque nine-arch railway bridge. Here, the tea goes in and out of view, with some stretches taking me over active railway tracks and others on paths shaded by tall eucalyptus and pine trees. The Pekoe Trail may be long and even tough in parts, but it is never boring or monotonous.\nAs Cruse says, \"There were just so many 'wow' moments during the hike, where you come around a corner, and the whole valley would just be laid out below and I would have to stop and just stare.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

New Zealand are a very good side but we played perfect cricket today.\n\"In such a short tournament you have to try and win every game that's in front of you. Australia have a rich history but it's about us.\"\nNew Zealand captain Mitchell Santner: \"It was a slower wicket than what we have come up against but we knew that coming in.\n\"If you had said we'd have to get 250, we'd have been happy. It spun more than we thought but their four quality spinners makes it pretty tough.\"\nFormer New Zealand wicketkeeper Katey Martin on BBC Test Match Special: \"New Zealand looked clueless against the spin and it was a challenging innings for Kane Williamson.\n\"It felt like they never got out of gear.

The Pulitzer Prize winning play was written in 1940 but not staged until after O'Neill's death in 1956.\nA semi-autobiographical work dedicated to his wife, O'Neill described it as \"play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\"\n\"It has not been an easy project to get off the ground,\" Lange admits.\n\"This is a throwback to another kind of filmmaking and another kind of storytelling but in my mind this is the greatest American play ever written.\n\"It has this universality, this emotional depth. You'd be hard pressed not to relate to something in it, especially in the world we live in now.\"\nShe plays Mary Tyrone, the matriarch of an American family who's addicted to morphine since the birth of her sons, who struggles with loneliness and fears about her boys' health.\n\"Mary Tyrone is one of these parts which mean the world to me,\" says Lange.\n\"It may sound corny but I love her. It's thrilling as an actor to have a part like this.\"\nShe's played the role twice before on stage and it's the 2016 Broadway version, directed by Jonathan Kent, which has been brought to the screen. \nFilming wrapped in 2022 but it's only now that Lange and co-star Ed Harris have been able to premiere it in Dublin and Glasgow.\nShe arrived at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday just as Tim Roth, who appeared in the opening film Tornado, departed.\nThe two actors were in the 1995 film Rob Roy, she as Mary McGregor, wife of Liam Neeson's Rob Roy, and he as the villainous Archibald Cunningham.\nAnd while Roth's abiding memories were of his war with the Highland midgie, Lange recalls a much more pleasant experience.\n\"It was such a marvellous time, up in the Highlands where I'd never spent time before and it was extraordinarily beautiful,\" she says.\n\"I had the whole family here and the kids had a whole life of their own going on.\n\"It was a very special time and I liked the film. Some locations and some projects you think, 'oh Christ why did I bother doing that?' and others you think 'that was something very special'.\"\nHer next projects will also focus on women. She's set to star in the film adaptation of Joan Didion's 2005 memoir The Year of Magical Thinking.\nAnd she's also keen to explore an extraordinary chapter in the life of the German actress Marlene Dietrich.\nIt focuses on the period when she moved to America and took US citizenship and the programme will reunite her with Feud and American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy.\n\"At a certain age in the eyes of Hollywood you are finished,\" says Lange.\n\"We touched on this in Feud about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. This was the time in Dietrich's life, when she segued into this weird Las Vegas act and the story is about her meeting a young composer who helps her launch a whole new career as a performer.\"\nThat composer was Burt Bacharach and for five years their unlikely partnership revived her career.\n\"It's an interesting period,\" says Lange.\n\"It's also the time she goes back to Germany for the first time after the war, and takes her up to those years when she was living as a complete recluse in Paris.\"\nShe hopes the project will be up and running before the end of the year.\nHollywood may have a reputation for writing off its older women, but Jessica Lange, at 75, is still fighting their corner.",

        "article_text": "Meghan's new Netflix series in which she offers cooking and home tips arrives next week. She's just the latest high-profile woman to present herself as a lifestyle guru \u2013 and divide opinion in doing so.\nThe Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle show is finally arriving on Netflix on Tuesday, after being pushed back because of the Los Angeles fires. With Love, Meghan sees her picking flowers, cooking with friends, and looking radiant in a huge, glossy Californian home.\nThe move into such well-worn domestic-goddess territory saw Meghan instantly dubbed \"the millennial Martha Stewart of Montecito\" in The New York Times. But of course, this being Meghan \u2013 the subject of a vast amount of criticism in the British media specifically and on social media generally \u2013 backlash flared the minute the trailer was released. She's flaunting her wealth, said her critics: tone-deaf. She's becoming a trad wife: bad feminist. She's fake, she just wants to sell products, she's unbearably earnest\u2026\u00a0\nAnd yet, Meghan has her fans as much as her detractors, and it's likely that With Love, Meghan will be a ratings hit for the streamer, bringing people together: not always in the way the show intends perhaps, but by persuading both those who buy into the pretty-princess fantasy \u2013 and those who may \"hate-watch\" it \u2013 to tune in, agog. \"Everyone's invited to create wonder in every moment\" \u2013 as Meghan puts it.\nThe public's feelings towards domestic goddesses \u2013 those women who sell a lifestyle, and a very particular idealised version of womanhood \u2013 have always been complex, but they may have never been more conflicted than in 2025. \"Of course, the image of the idealised woman has changed over time, and even more rapidly in recent years\" says Dr Edith Hill, an Australian academic whose research is in social media, influencers and women's bodies online. These days, Hill tells the BBC, \"there is no one ''ideal' image of a woman online, as each community and sub-community has their own version of the perfect creator.\" This means that the most famous end up both loved and loathed: figures like Meghan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nara Smith walk the line between having devoted fanbases, and being scorned, castigated and even blamed for a wealth of societal ills.\nNara Smith is probably the most famous iteration of the most vexed contemporary version of the domestic goddess: the trad wife. Smith has 11.5 million followers on TikTok \u2013 that's a lot of people who want to watch videos from her home in Texas, where she raises kids and bakes their food from scratch. While wearing ballgowns. In a gorgeous kitchen. You could say it's aggressively aspirational \u2013 but it's also patently unrealistic. I doubt many people watching genuinely wish they too could make their toddlers homemade bubblegum while wearing a lime-green conical-bust gown. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\n\u2022 Ten of the best TV shows to watch this March\n\u2022 Why influencers are facing a pushback\nOf course, many women do find joy and satisfaction in the kitchen \u2013 or in other traditional domestic activities, such as hosting, home-making, arranging flowers, dressing in a feminine way\u2026 there's nothing inherently \"unfeminist\" with any of that. But the broader interest in trad wives \u2013 women who espouse traditional 1950s-style family values, and dedicate themselves wholly to keeping house and raising kids \u2013 has been seen by many as a worryingly retrograde step. Less domestic goddess, more domestic servitude, is the gist of the criticism. \"There is a certain undertone from some of the more traditional creators that does lean toward very stereotypical gender roles and strong religious ideals, that can lead to the oppression of women,\" says Hill. \"It would be naive to ignore the very close line that can be drawn between that content and women's oppression.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe recent obsession with trad wives may reflect a broader disenchantment with modern lifestyles: the anxiety that what equality of the sexes actually brought us is merely drudgery for all. When two parents have to work constantly in order to have enough money to live, and women also end updoing a \"second shift\" of housework and childcare, the old model of dividing the labour might look more appealing.\nArguably, we could more accurately place the source of the problem with capitalism, rather than feminism \"gone too far\". And it is unfortunately inevitable that full-time tradwiffery requires a partner who earns a lot of money, inevitably also bringing that traditional dynamic into play: domestic bliss predicated on man-as-breadwinner, woman-as-helpmeet.\nBut as much as there is endless hand-wringing in the media over the meaning of the trad-wife phenomenon, in some ways, it's nothing new: domestic goddesses have always been a source of fascination \u2013 dismissed as retrograde by some, and yet a source of aspiration, inspiration, and even compulsion for others. Because they don't just present a certain lifestyle: they often promise that you, scruffy disorganised frazzled ordinary woman, could be a domestic goddess too, if you just do what they say. Witness: the OG DG, Martha Stewart, who made a multi-million-dollar empire out of housekeeping tips.\nStewart made her name as a hard-grafting lifestyle guru who would tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it properly, whether putting up a shelf or planning a wedding. And part of the appeal of domestic goddesses has always been this illusion of control, of solution: do this, and have a better life.\nStewart started out running a catering business in 1975, before publishing the legendary 1982 glossy how-to guide, Entertaining. It was just the starting gun of the unstoppable Martha Stewart brand, that's since flogged everything from tea towels to CBD gummies; she's published more than 100 books offering brisk guidance on gardening, hosting, cooking and homemaking. And the news that Entertaining is to be republished this year surely supports the theory that we're in a retro domestic goddess moment.\nFollowing in Martha's footsteps came another US DG who inspires a devoted following: Ina Garten aka The Barefoot Contessa. Garten just published a memoir, Be Ready When the Luck Happens, designed to persuade people that her seemingly charmed career \u2013 from running a Hamptons food store so casually chic that it featured in a Nancy Meyers movie, to fronting scores of cookery books and TV shows since the 90s \u2013 was the result of hard work and good timing, a blend of effort and effortlessness.\nGarten's recipes also straddle effort and effortlessness: she specialises in rich, indulgent, bistro-style deliciousness, and offers detailed instruction as to exactly how to achieve it. But she's won fans for her catchphrase \"store-bought is fine\": a pinch of realism amid the lifestyle gloss.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd of course, not all domestic goddesses have been about perfection or spending hours in the kitchen \u2013 in fact, many have made a career out of proffering tips and tricks to make hosting and homemaking easier. Shirley Conran, the British journalist and author \u2013 also sometimes called the \"original\" domestic goddess \u2013\u00a0 promoted the idea of women \"having it all\", and famously informed women in her 1975 pop-feminism housework manual Superwoman that \"life is too short to stuff a mushroom\". Nara Smith clearly didn't get the memo.\nThe idea of Superwoman was to liberate women from the tyranny of housework and perfection, not to be trapped by it: a domestic goddess in the 70s was the woman who had it all \u2013 job, home, marriage, kids, good sex, control of their finances, and a general air of fabulousness. The title was not actually meant to be taken seriously: \"A Superwoman isn\u2019t a woman who can do anything, but a woman who avoids doing too much,\" Conran wrote.\nAnd missing the irony has often been an issue for DGs \u2013 not least for the deliciously tongue-in-cheek Nigella Lawson, who helped popularise the term. The curvaceous, flirtatious British chef also began her career with a book full of time-saving tips and anti-perfectionist reassurance: \"Never worry about what your guests will think of you,\" she wrote encouragingly in How to Eat. \"Just think of the food. What will taste good?\"\nBut her second book in 1998 was called How to Be a Domestic Goddess \u2013 a joke that was missed, she's long insisted, and a title that now makes her cringe. \"It was supposed to be ironic,\" she told the New York Times in 2019. Today, Lawson is a full-on national treasure in the UK, but at the start of her fame, and rather like today's trad wives, she was castigated by some critics who accused her of setting back feminism. She has since countered her critics by describing baking as feminist.\nA domestic goddess became a standard to live up to, and yet another reason for women to feel inadequate. And this is the contradiction at the heart of DGs, whether they\u2019re incredibly earnest (Meghan; Gwyneth) or winkingly ironic (Lawson): while many give off an air of effortlessness and espouse mantras of ease for most women most of the time, such domestic bliss is actually not easy. Or, indeed, affordable. \"We're not in the pursuit of perfection, we're in the pursuit of joy,\" declares Meghan in the trailer for her show.\u00a0 But it's hard not to feel like it would be a lot easier to pursue joy if you lived in a Californian mansion with help. To state the obvious, an enviable, idealised lifestyle is more readily available when you don't have to stress about the bills, and instead have the free time to, say, learn to fold a napkin like an Easter bunny.\nIt is also so obvious as to be almost banal to point out that DGs are mostly very wealthy. And fortune begets fortune: all this lifestyle content is, on some level, also an advert for the DGs' product lines, whether that's Meghan's company, As Ever, selling jams, Ina's cookware, or Gwyneth\u2019s Goop empire.\nFor some, the wholesome, homespun emphasis on making preserves or crafting your own table decorations is particularly grating precisely because these women are clearly monied and leisured enough to have time for all that. Yet for others, that's what's appealing, even soothing, about watching them: we may not have a spare four hours to bake, but we can watch a four-minute video of Nara Smith baking; we may not have the money to make like Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway at the opening of the eponymous novel, and buy the flowers ourselves, but we can watch Meghan pick out blooms in a fancy florist.\n\"The domesticity is presented to us as peaceful while also fulfilling,\" says Hill, on the appeal of this sort of content, which it is so easy to be cynical about. \"Many people can relate to wanting to nourish and nurture their families, but what this looks like in reality for everyone else is at complete odds to the image we're presented through these curated narratives.\"\nPerhaps this is the key: we mustn't mistake today's goddesses with mere mortals \u2013 consider them floating fictional constructs, higher(-earning) beings. And absolutely not a yardstick against which to measure ideal femininity. \"I think we can be inspired by these women and the lives they are presenting,\" say Hill, \"while also recognising it is wholly impossible to attain.\"\nWith Love, Meghan is on Netflix from 4 March\nHolly Williams's novel, The Start of Something, is out in paperback now\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

About a third are saying they might reduce their workforce as a result of these changes,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nMr McTague added the key issues with the bill were the government not helping small businesses to fund sick pay and the changes to day one dismissal rights.\n\"We're not sort of crying wolf, we're saying these will have really damaging effects and if the government wants the economy to grow they need small businesses on their side,\" he said.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

'Fire and rehire'Other amendments being tabled are expected to include the doubling of the penalty imposed on companies that engage in so-called \"fire and rehire'' practices.This means that if they fail to properly consult employees before dismissing and then rehiring them on less favourable terms, they could be forced to pay the worker 180 days' worth of pay in compensation up from the current 90-day penalty payment.The amendments also contain a commitment to extend sick pay to workers earning under \u00a3123 a week from the first day of their illness.They will be entitled to 80% of their average weekly earnings or statutory sick pay - which is currently \u00a3116.75 per week \u2013 whichever is lowest.Currently, to qualify for statutory sick pay, a worker must have been ill for three days in a row.There will also be changes to rules around trade union recognition and the ability of unions to take industrial action.The government is proposing that workers will have to give their employers 10 days' warning of any strike action \u2013 rather than the existing 14 days' notice.Currently, there can be a ballot for union recognition if 10% of the workforce is a member of a union.The government had been consulting on lowering it to 2% but the proposed amendment will not state a figure and will simply give the secretary of state the power to lower the 10% threshold.Mr Novak said the changes were about ''creating a modern economy that works for workers and business alike'' and that driving up standards \"will stop good employers from being undercut by the bad, and will mean more workers benefit from a union voice\".Several business groups have been critical of the government for not providing more detail about how the legislation will work in practice.They are unlikely to be satisfied by what is in the amendments.Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the majority of the trade association's members were \"very concerned\" about the Employment Rights Bill. About a third are saying they might reduce their workforce as a result of these changes,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.Mr McTague added the key issues with the bill were the government not helping small businesses to fund sick pay and the changes to day one dismissal rights. \"We're not sort of crying wolf, we're saying these will have really damaging effects and if the government wants the economy to grow they need small businesses on their side,\" he said.Low-paid workers to get 80% of salary in sick payHow will the changes to workers' rights  affect you?Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.",

We had to run into a store screaming that somebody was going to kill us.\"\nValkyrae, who has 3.4m followers on Instagram, said she hopes it's a \"learning for other streamers\".\n\"It only takes one person, so be careful.\"\nPosting on X, she also said what happened demonstrates the \"harsh reality women live in\" and hit out at online comments that it was staged to drive hits.\n\"Seeing accounts accusing my friends and I for faking this and blaming us instead of questioning the man's behaviour has been embarrassing to see.\n\"I've learned it doesn't matter how much I accomplish in this industry or how much I try to gain respect, some men will hate women and blame women no matter the situation.\"\nEmiru did not appear in the follow-up stream on Monday but posted on X afterwards. \n\"I wish I could say this was some kind of one-in-a-million incident, but the truth is, it is not,\" she said. \"This is what life is like for girls.\n\"I hope if anything, people see what happened and realise how much of a reality it is for women and content creators as a whole.\"\nBBC Newsbeat has contacted Pacific Park for comment. \nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.\nHe returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.\nBBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims. \nTrump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.\nThis is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.\nOn rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".\nInflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.\nThe 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.\nInflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.\nTrump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".\nPrices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.\nEgg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.\nThe USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (\u00a3780m) plan to help combat the issue.\nThe outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it. \nThe Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.\nTrump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.\nNo evidence has been provided for this figure.\nOn its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\nHowever, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.\nUS media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.\nSpeaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".\nThis is true.\nIn February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.\nThis is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.\nBy comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden. \nNumbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.\nContinuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".\nThere is no evidence for a figure this high.\nEncounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.\nIt is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.\nA report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.\nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.\nOn US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: \"We've spent perhaps $350bn\u2026 and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is.\"\nBBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included.\nThe US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.\nIt calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn.\nThe US Department of Defense has a higher figure of $182.8bn - taking into account a broader range of US military activity in Europe - but this is still considerably less than Trump's figure.\nWe have asked the White House where it comes from.\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.\nAdditional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

But today he reacted fantastic, playing focused, serious, saving one action that was a goal.\n\"Of course I know the difficulties in football and how we can have experiences and how we can get better and analyse everything deeply and try and correct it - that is my only target with the players.\n\"We corrected something from the match we played here.\"\nThis was Villa's first knockout tie in European football's premier competition since the 1982-83 quarter-finals - and Emery's side are certainly making up for lost time. \nClub Brugge, who wasted at least two good chances, will feel they did not deserve to lose 3-1, but Villa have given themselves a golden chance to go through to the last eight.\nEmery, however, is not getting carried away.\n\"We are not in the quarter-finals,\" the Spaniard was quick to point out.\n\"There's still 90 minutes to play. We're ready in case we need extra time and penalties because I know how difficult it is in each match.\n\"The players, I'm sure they have experiences before as well with matches like that and we have to respect the opponent always.\n\"They won against Atalanta 3-1 [in the knockout-round play-offs] and they compete very well.\n\"We need to watch the match again with the players to understand the difficulties we can face against teams in Europe.\n\"I am happy but calm, getting balance.\"\nAston Villa scored more goals in this match (three) than they had in their previous five meetings with Belgian sides in all competitions combined (two)",

Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump said he would cut funding for universities that allow what he called \"illegal\" protests and prosecute and deport foreign students who participate. \nOn his Truth Social social media platform, Trump said that \"all federal funding will STOP\" for schools that permit students to protest illegally. \nTrump's announcement comes less than a year after massive student protests against Israel's war in Gaza swept across US college campuses, including Columbia University in New York and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \nAmerican students will be expelled, Trump said. \nTrump did not specify what would constitute an \"illegal\" protest. Broadly speaking, the right to protest is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. \nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as Fire, swiftly condemned Trump's announcement. \n\"Colleges can and should respond to unlawful conduct, but the president does not have unilateral authority to revoke federal funds, even for colleges that allow 'illegal' protests,\" the statement said. \nThe group added that the move will \"cast an impermissible chill on student protests about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\". \nIn a separate announcement, the US Department of Education, General Services Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services said they would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of Columbia's federal contracts amid an ongoing investigation into compliance with Title VI, a federal law that bans discrimination based on ethnicity or ancestry. \nIn a statement, the education department said that it is considering stop work orders for $51.4m (\u00a340.19m) in contracts with the New York City-based university, and will review more than $5bn in grant commitments to the school. \n\"Americans have watched in horror for more than a year now, as Jewish students have been assaulted and harassed on elite university campuses - repeatedly overrun by antisemitic students and agitators,\" Trump's new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, said in a statement. \nMcMahon added that \"unlawful encampments and demonstrations have completely paralysed day-to-day campus operations, depriving Jewish students of learning opportunities to which they are entitled\". \nIn January, Trump signed an executive order that called for the removal of foreign students who participated in protests. \nThe order also directed government departments to make recommendations that could allow educational institutions to \"monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff\" and, if warranted, remove them. \nA White House fact sheet on the order specified that it seeks to \"protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities\". \nIn April 2024, student protests against the war in Gaza drew national attention after students at Columbia were arrested at a student encampment set up on campus. \nThousands of arrests were ultimately made at dozens of universities across the country. \nAt Columbia, the university authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building.\nFour months after protests rocked the campus, Columbia president Minouche Shafik resigned. \nEarlier this week, a federal task force announced it would visit 10 prominent US universities that have been the scene of anti-semitic incidents.

        "article_text": "Blue skies, picture-perfect flowers, intricately-prepared cakes and Californian sunshine streams through the windows. Oh, and another celeb turns up in the kitchen.\nIs that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.\nWe see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.\nIt's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").\nWhat you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.\n\"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,\" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.\nShe makes different types of pasta, crudit\u00e9s, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.\nThere are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt. \n\"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,\" Meghan explains. \"So I try to under salt.\"\nFriends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.\nIt's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.\nIt's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.\nWhether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.\nIt's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.\nInstead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.\nMeghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.\nAnd of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.\nIt's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.\nMeghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".\nThe hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.\nWe see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.\nMindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.\n\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.\n\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'\nMeghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".\nWe learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.\nThere's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.\n\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.\nThere are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.\nShe's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"\nAs a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here. \nIn the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".\nDoes this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.\nEverything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.\nThis series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided.

        "article_text": "The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the country\nEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.\nAt the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.\nBy rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.\nA little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. It has proved controversial and, anecdotally, the perception is that it has been a retrograde step.\nWhile the aim was to create an accurate reflection of a golfer's ability to take on any course in the world, many players believe the system is easy to abuse for those wanting to fuel their egos with a low handicap or for those desiring a higher one to be more competitive.\nBut is that a true reflection of how it is or a myth?  Certainly, there is a different view among those who administer the WHS, compared with those grumbling over a post round pint.\nEx-motorcycle gang member reaches Open with win\n67 million to one - Whitnell hits two holes-in-one\nBoom or bust? Golf in flux but is it really thriving?\nIt is an issue that affects millions of golfers across the world and England Golf, the UK's biggest federation, believes the system is working. Furthermore, this is being reflected by the recreational game's increasing popularity.\n\"The reality was, certainly up to the launch of WHS (in November 2020), that there was a decrease every year over a 10-year period with regards to people wanting to play - the numbers of people that played in competitions and then consequently, the number of people that were actually having handicaps,\" Jeremy Tomlinson, England Golf's chief executive told BBC Sport.\nUnder the old CONGU system that prevailed in Great Britain and Ireland, handicaps were effectively determined by performances predominantly in club competitions.\nNow it is easier for regular social golf to count. This includes shorter rounds over nine holes, performances in head-to-head matchplay and while playing with a partner.\nGolfers are able to submit 'general play' scores from rounds with their friends, provided they have specified before teeing off that they want their game to count for handicap purposes.\nThis means more rounds count towards determining a players ability. The best eight scores from your 20 most recent rounds are averaged to provide what is known as a handicap index.\nThis figure is then transportable to any golf course and is used to calculate how many shots you can deduct from your total score. The harder the course, the more shots you receive to reflect the level of difficulty.\nBut the system works on a level of trust. Some players want the lowest possible handicap to help make them eligible for elite amateur events while others desire a few extra shots to help them win swanky competition prizes.\nHandicaps can now be as high as 54 (previously 36) and the average in England is 19. \"The game's gone soft,\" is a regular moan among diehard members.\n\"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"That's probably because the old system lent, we believe, a lot more to towards the lower handicapper.\n\"But of course, there are just more people who have come in.\n\"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete.\"\nThere are 722,000 golfers affiliated to England Golf through clubs and the number is continuing to rise. Since November 2020, 38m handicap scores have been submitted to the federation's central database, with 10m in the last year alone.\nPlayers do not have to be a member of a club to gain a handicap, and the Woodhall Spa based organisation offers it's iGolf app as a means for an ever growing number of more nomadic golfers.\n\"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.\nNevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions. \"Griping is a big word, but I think that those complaining are frustrated that it is different,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"Golf has become a lot more inclusive in providing the opportunity for different people to win, and especially when their handicap is on the way down, while they're getting into golf and getting better and better.\"\nTomlinson added: \"The handicapping system is about integrity. It is more transparent than it's ever been because it is about the scores that you do. But there is a need for check and challenge.\"\nSitting next to the England Golf boss, Flint nodded agreement. He said: \"There is sometimes this thought that, oh, let's just ban the higher handicappers from competitions because they're always winning it.\n\"It's a myth. Clubs can use the terms of competition and have categories, so everyone can play the competition from an inclusivity point of view. Have a prize for the low handicaps as well as mid and high handicapper.\"\nSeveral county unions are now insisting that more scores from competitions, rather than general play, are used to calculate low handicaps when determining eligibility for elite tournaments and representative teams.\n\"We reserve the right to be able to review any handicap that has more than four general play scorecards,\" Tomlinson insisted. \"We have denied players entrance to some of our championships because they've had too many general play cards.\"\nTomlinson insists the authorities, including the R&A and United States Golf Association who brought in WHS, are keen to further the probity of the mechanism.\n\"The R&A are just about to bring out a specification within the system which will identify where they think manipulation's happening,\" he said.\n\"It's another tool that the club handicap committee can use to address that issue. It's not 100%, but it's something that will help.\n\"Ultimately, any system - if people want to manipulate it, they will. It's not the system that's at fault, it's the individuals.\"\nTomlinson believes he is presiding over a growing recreational sport that profited from the bounce golf received by being the first sport people could play after the 2020 Covid pandemic lockdown.\nAs the nation shut down, hundreds of clubs in the UK feared for their future.  Tomlinson sat in emergency meetings across all British sports. \"We were inundated with clubs saying we're going to rack and ruin,\" he recalled.\n\"Amazing. From that point onwards, people were starting to think about their health. Golf clubs became inundated with people writing to them wanting membership, wanting to have playing rights.\n\"And I promise you that the back four weeks of that initial lockdown, I went to those meetings and I hardly said a word because I was watching in my sport compared to sports like swimming, athletics, even cricket that were suffering immeasurably because they weren't able to open up their facilities.\n\"We were building something, and by 13 May when we came out of that lockdown, we'd almost got to zero with regard to our concerns up and down the country because almost every golf club was reporting in that they were filling up.\n\"And of course, by the end of that year, they were pretty much full with waiting lists. That's what happened to golf from from the pandemic.\"\nTomlinson believes his sport, at a recreational level, has been left far healthier as a result. More people are playing at every level, whether on traditional courses or at driving ranges, in simulators or at crazy golf courses.\nHe wants to exploit this enthusiasm to grow the sport by creating pathways from these fringe versions to actual courses, club memberships and handicap competitions.\nDespite anecdotal grumblings, the figures stack up to suggest such movement is occurring. \"And that's brilliant,\" he said.\n\"And to those crusty old golfers; we still love them. We still want to take care of them, but we need them to be a bit more progressive in their thinking.\"",

        "article_text": "A $53bn (\u00a341.4 billion) reconstruction plan to rival President Donald Trump's idea for the US to \"take over Gaza\" and move out more than two million Palestinians has been approved by Arab leaders at an emergency summit in the Egyptian capital Cairo.\n\"The Egypt plan is now an Arab plan,\" announced the secretary general of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit at the end of this hours-long gathering.\nWithout referring specifically to President Trump's ideas, he underlined that \"the Arab stance is to reject any displacement, whether it is voluntary or forced\".\nEgypt had produced a detailed blueprint, with a 91-page glossy document including images of leafy neighbourhoods and grand public buildings, to counter a US scheme labelled as a \"Middle East Riviera\" which shocked the Arab world and beyond.\nWhat sets this new plan apart is it is not just about property development; its banners are politics and the rights of Palestinians.\nIn his opening remarks, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi also called for a parallel plan alongside the physical reconstruction to move towards what is known as the two state solution \u2013 a Palestinian state alongside Israel. This is widely seen by Arab states, and many others, as the only lasting solution to this perpetual conflict, but it is firmly ruled out by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.\nThis new plan proposes that Gaza would be run, temporarily, by a \"Gaza management committee under the umbrella of the Palestinian government\" comprised of qualified technocrats.\nIt glosses over the issue of what role, if any, Hamas, will play. There is a vague reference to the \"obstacle\" of militant groups and said this issue would be resolved if the causes of the conflict with Israel were removed.\nSome Arab states are known to be calling for the complete dismantling of Hamas; others believe those decisions should be left up to the Palestinians. Hamas is said to have accepted it will not play a role in running Gaza but has made it clear that disarming is a red line.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described President Trump's plan as \"visionary\", has repeatedly ruled out any future role for Hamas, but also for the Palestinian Authority.\nThe other sensitive issue of security was dealt with by calling on the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers.\nAnd a major international conference will be held next month to raise the huge sums of money necessary for this rebuilding project.\nWealthy Gulf states appear willing to foot some of the colossal bill. But no one is ready to invest unless they are absolutely convinced buildings won't come crashing down in another war.\nA fragile ceasefire which now seems to be on the brink of collapse will only amplify that hesitation.\nThis new Arab plan to rebuild Gaza would unfold in three phases including an initial period of about six months, called the early recovery stage, to start clearing the massive amounts of rubble as well as unexploded ordinance. Two subsequent stages would last several years.\nDuring this time displaced Palestinians, said to number 1.5 million, would be housed in temporary containers. Photographs in the glossy brochure present them as well-built and designed housing units set in pretty landscaped areas.\nPresident Trump continues to wonder aloud \"Why wouldn't they want to move?\" His description of Gaza as a \"demolition site\" underlines how the territory lies in utter ruin. The UN says 90% of homes are damaged or destroyed. \nAll the basics of a life worth living, from schools and hospitals to sewage systems and electricity lines, are shredded.\nThe US President deepened the shock and anger around his ideas when he posted an AI-generated video of a golden Gaza on his Truth Social account which featured a shimmering statue of himself, his close ally Elon Musk enjoying snacks on the beach, and he and the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu sunning themselves, shirtless. All to a catchy tune, with lines like \"Trump Gaza is finally here\".\n\"They had President Trump in mind,\" remarked one Western diplomat who attended a briefing about Egypt's plan at the foreign ministry in Cairo. \"It's very glossy and very well-prepared.\"\nCairo's proposal is said to have drawn on a wide range of expertise, from World Bank professionals on sustainability, to Dubai developers on hotels.  \nThere are also lessons learned from other ravaged cities which rose from the ruins including Hiroshima, Beirut, and Berlin. And the proposed designs are also influenced by Egypt's own experience in developing its \"New Cairo\", its grand megaproject which has seen a new administrative capital rising from the desert \u2013 at great expense.\nThe American President has said he won't \"force\" his ideas on anyone but still insists his plan is the one \"that really works\".\nNow it is up to the Arab states and their allies to prove that their plan is the only plan.",

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",
