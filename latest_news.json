Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nWe are only two races into the 2025 Formula 1 season and there has already been a major driver change with Red Bull promoting Yuki Tsunoda to replace Liam Lawson.\nTsunoda competes at his home grand prix in Japan this weekend as team-mate to world champion Max Verstappen for the first time, with New Zealander Lawson demoted to Racing Bulls. \nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions on the Red Bull situation and more before the race in Suzuka.\nWhat would be a good season for Yuki Tsunoda after the recent driver switch? - David\nRed Bull's decision to demote Liam Lawson after just two races and put Yuki Tsunoda in the second Red Bull alongside Max Verstappen is nothing less than a career lifeline for Tsunoda.\nThe 24-year-old Japanese was staring at the likely end of his career this season.\nThat's because he owed his seat at the second Red Bull team to Honda, and it is moving to Aston Martin for 2026, where there is no seat available to Tsunoda and no realistic prospect of one.\nWithout Honda, the chances of Racing Bulls keeping Tsunoda for 2026 were slim, when there are other Red Bull juniors coming along the conveyor belt.\nSo a seat alongside Verstappen this year gives him the opportunity to show once and for all that he deserves a long-time place in F1.\nBut what level of performance would do that?\nThe fact remains that Red Bull have a minimum level of expectation for their second driver - and that's to be within about 0.3 seconds a lap of Verstappen on a consistent basis.\nThat's what Tsunoda needs to do to convince Red Bull that he deserves to be considered as a contender for a seat in 2026.\nAnd realistically if he does not do that, he is unlikely to convince anyone else that he is worth investing in either.\nThis video can not be played\nRed Bull's second seat dilemma - F1 Breakdown\nIf Max Verstappen leaves Red Bull are they in even greater trouble than just losing their star driver? It seems like they'd be losing the only person who can drive their car, a situation that's seemingly self-inflicted. Are they likely to be making their 2026 car more driveable to mitigate this risk? - Tom\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Lawson-Tsunoda driver swap is that it gives another perspective on the state Red Bull are in with their car.\nVerstappen believes it is the fourth quickest car in F1 at the moment - so behind the McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari. Although on average qualifying pace in the three sessions so far, it is actually second fastest behind the McLaren.\nBut it may be that it is only both of those things with Verstappen in it.\nThe issue for Red Bull is that they have one genius-level driver and one average one, in F1 terms - and that remains the case with Tsunoda in the second seat, or at least that's what most would believe right now.\nSo it's almost a case of split the difference between the drivers to judge the level of the car.\nThe bottom line seems to be that the new Red Bull is simply not that good a car, and certainly one which is unpredictable and does not generate confidence in a driver. Even Verstappen finds it difficult to drive - but he is so good that he is able to coax a good lap time out of it.\nVerstappen is regarded by most as the best driver in F1 at the moment - so if that's true, it stands to reason that the car would be worse with pretty much anyone else in it.\nIt seems Red Bull have chased peak aerodynamic performance at the expense of drivability - which is ironic, because that is exactly the opposite of the philosophy that Adrian Newey has championed throughout his career.\nLegendary designer Newey, who stopped working on Red Bull in F1 last April, and has just come to the end of his first month with Aston Martin, has always believed that it was better to have slightly less downforce that the driver can use all of, than more theoretical downforce that can't be accessed because the car is too \"peaky\". Or, as Lawson put it, the \"window\" is too narrow.\nLike all teams, Red Bull designed the best car they could for the new season. The question that hangs over them now is, do they know how to fix it?\nAfter another very dry sprint race in China I wonder again why F1 doesn't give the teams tyres that enables the drivers to race through a sprint. Surely the point of the sprint is it is fast, exciting and full of action? - Richard\nThis is a question about tyre management. The fact is that - with a few very limited exceptions - drivers have never been able to race flat out since Pirelli entered F1 as the tyre supplier in 2011.\nThat's not how their tyres work. Pirelli tyres have to be managed to stay within a temperature window.\nDrive them flat out and they overheat. And if they overheat, they rarely come back to optimum grip level. Sometimes this is even the case over a single qualifying lap.\nPirelli has been asked before to provide tyres that can be driven flat out, but so far it has not done so.\nThis video can not be played\nSwapped seats & shaky starts: What to know before Japanese Grand Prix\nIs this season a write-off for Aston Martin? - Carlos\nIt's not looking good so far, is it?\nOn average, the Aston Martin is the seventh fastest car over a single lap over the first three races of the season, including the China sprint. Only the Alpine, Sauber and Haas have been slower.\nIt's fair to say that Fernando Alonso has not had his best start to a season, and mistakes in qualifying at both races so far have hurt the team's ultimate potential.\nSo, it's not completely clear yet what the car's ceiling is.\nAston Martin came into this season with two main aims - to produce a more drivable car, and to prove that they could solve the correlation issues they have had between simulation and the real world and design upgrades that perform as expected.\nThe drivers say that it is more drivable than last year - it's just not that quick.\nIf they can prove their upgrades work, then the season will be at least a qualified success, regardless of the performance of the car to some extent.\nSo it is probably fair to wait for at least the first upgrade package - which would typically be expected around May some time - before forming any firm conclusions.\nHow to follow Japanese Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat's the future for F1 engines and why is it up for debate?\nIs there a circuit(s) you'd really want on the calendar that currently isn't on there? And at the expense of which current circuit(s)? I love Fuji and I'm not a fan of street circuits \u2013 RAP\nThe F1 calendar has a pretty good selection of circuits at the moment.\nThere are some obvious candidates in the United States - Road America and Laguna Seca are both great circuits. But then so is Austin, and both Miami and Las Vegas work for the sport on a financial level.\nBathurst in Australia is awesome - but not suitable for F1, sadly.\nAs for Fuji, great backdrop, when the clouds are not covering Mount Fuji, but as a circuit it is not a patch on Suzuka.\nThe one big miss in terms of the calendar is France. Somehow, it seems wrong not to have a grand prix in the country that gave birth to motorsport and hosted the first race with that title, even if Monaco is regarded as a sort of proxy French race.\nThe problem is that France's only circuits with licences for F1 are Paul Ricard and Magny-Cours. Uninspiring both.\nBut if the Sarthe circuit at Le Mans could be brought up to F1 standard and host a grand prix, that would be quite something.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "article_text": "Anthony Elanga believes he is benefiting from regular football at Nottingham Forest\nAnthony Elanga had left Manchester United in the past. On Tuesday, they trailed in his wake.\nAlejandro Garnacho and Patrick Dorgu could not keep up with the 22-year-old as he burst from the edge of his own area on to Ryan Yates' defensive header, collected the ball and ran 70 yards.\nThe Sweden winger still had the composure to find the bottom corner from 18 yards.\nA special moment - but he refused to celebrate against the club he joined as a 12-year-old. \nA 1-0 win maintained Forest's relentless quest to reach the Champions League and left them third in the Premier League, with a 10-point lead over Newcastle in sixth. \nBoss Nuno Espirito Santo admitted he had never seen a goal like it, while Forest captain Yates labelled his team-mate a \"midfielder's dream\".\n\"It is about attacking the space and getting to the opposite goal as quick as I can. I saw the space and I believe I'm one of the fastest players in the league,\" Elanga told TNT Sports while holding his man-of-the-match award.\n\"The finish is something I have been trying to work on. Left foot or right foot, I am quite comfortable with both feet this season.\n\"All you want to do is keep on improving. Coming here is about playing and developing. I appreciate Manchester United so much as I learned a lot there.\n\"I am enjoying my football and I want to keep on going.\"\nHis \u00a315m move to Nottingham Forest in 2023 was meant to bring that enjoyment back into his game. \nHe made 55 appearances, scoring four goals, for United but was jettisoned by Erik ten Hag, who felt the winger wasn't going to make the grade. That came after just five Premier League starts in 2022-23. \nInterestingly, though, current United boss Ruben Amorim played down the fact that Elanga was allowed to leave.\nHe said: \"We are talking about a lot of players who were at Manchester United who are doing right, but they had the chance here. At United, you don't have the time. I will not have the time. We have to get it right fast.\n\"They were here and here the pressure is too big sometimes. Sometimes you don't have time and you should have time for these kids to develop. \n\"For that you need a strong base. If you don't have it, we are not going to help our kids. They had their chances and sometimes the pressure playing for Manchester United is really big.\" \nThere are clearly no regrets from Elanga, though, whose six-goal return is a season's best. \n\"I made the right decision, 100%,\" Elanga told the Athletic in December. \"I have not really spoken about this, but at the time at United, I was very young and I was coming into a team that was struggling. \n\"Yes, there was the thought that 'I am playing for Manchester United'. But I also never felt as though I was improving. I was playing for the sake of playing when I did get the odd opportunity off the bench.\n\"Coming to Forest was so big for me, because suddenly I was regularly playing 90 minutes, while having the opportunity to improve. When I played, I felt like I had purpose; like I was playing and improving in the process. That was the biggest change for me.\n\"I feel as though I know the league inside-out now, because I have had the chance to learn. I have no regrets, because I am enjoying playing fantastic football with this team. We are in a really good place at the moment.\"\nThat place has only got better after a deserved win over United pushed them closer to a fairytale finale this season, with an FA Cup semi final against Manchester City part of it.\nWith eight games remaining, they are closing in on the Champions League. \nElanga has played his part with his goals and eight assists, for which he is joint-seventh in the Premier League standings. And he's quick: Before Tuesday's game, the stats showed he had spent 1.17% of his time on the pitch this season sprinting - a Premier League high.\nAfter Tuesday's goal, that figure will undoubtedly have improved. \nAs Nuno said of his matchwinner: \"He did it by himself. There is no better counter-attack. He is a special player.\"\nForest boost chances as Champions League race intensifies\nAlmost a saviour - is makeshift striker Maguire sign of Man Utd struggles?\nAnalysis by Simon Stone, chief football news reporter\nRalf Rangnick, arriving at Old Trafford to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in December 2021, quickly concluded Anthony Elanga had a bright future.\nRangnick clearly knew Elanga had pace - and felt his direct style was a threat to opposition defences, which in turn could create space for others.\nCrucially, he also felt Elanga was aware of the space around him and didn't forget his defensive duties, even if his preference was to go forward.\nThat he featured in 26 out of Rangnick's 29 games in charge says it all about the current Austria coach's view.\nSadly for Elanga, Erik ten Hag had a different outlook.\nThe Dutchman did not feel Elanga had the quality needed to be enough of an influence on his squad.\nThat meant he was jettisoned in 2023 after a single campaign under the Dutchman.\nThe problem was the attacking players who came in the same summer \u2013 Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund \u2013 have failed to deliver. The wide attacking players United already had \u2013 Antony, Amad Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho \u2013 were inconsistent at best, Anthony Martial was injured and Marcus Rashford's form fell off a cliff.\nTen Hag's assessment was probably right. United were third then, as Forest are third now. Maybe that is Elanga's level. What he really did not bargain for was the Old Trafford side hurtling backwards at such an alarming rate. Third to them now seems light years away.",

Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nMax Verstappen says it \"was not a mistake\" that he liked a comment on social media describing Red Bull's decision to demote Liam Lawson as \"a panic move\" and \"close to bullying\".\nThe remarks were made by Dutch former Formula 1 driver Giedo van der Garde, a friend of the Verstappen family, on Instagram, external after Red Bull moved New Zealander Lawson down to their second team Racing Bulls in a swap with Japan's Yuki Tsunoda just two races into the season.\nRed Bull's Verstappen said: \"I liked the comment, the text, so I guess that speaks for itself, right?\"\nThe four-time champion refused to expand in public on his feelings about the decision, but added: \"Everything has been shared with the team, how I think about everything.\n\"Sometimes it's not necessary, you know, to always share and say everything in public. I think it's better [not to].\"\nFellow F1 drivers Oscar Piastri, Pierre Gasly - himself the victim of a mid-season driver swap by Red Bull - and Nico Hulkenberg also liked the post.\nRed Bull's decision to drop Lawson was a U-turn after they preferred him over Tsunoda last winter when they paid off Sergio Perez two years before the end of his contract.\nThat was despite Lawson having raced in only 11 grands prix over two seasons compared with Tsunoda's four years of experience.\nFerrari driver Lewis Hamilton described the dropping of Lawson as \"pretty harsh\".\nVerstappen said Red Bull had to \"take a good look at ourselves and just keep on working and keep on improving the car\".\nHamilton has 'absolute 100% faith' in Ferrari\nWhat's it like being a replacement F1 driver?\nTsunoda told to be 'as close to Verstappen as possible'\nLawson struggled to come to terms with the wayward handling of the Red Bull car.\nHe qualified 18th for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, and last for both the sprint and main grand prix in China, and failed to make significant progress in any of the races.\nRed Bull demoted him because they felt he was in a spiral from which he could not recover.\nVerstappen explained the characteristics that had led Lawson to struggle.\n\"It's hard because, I mean, for me, this is the only car that I know, right?\" Verstappen said. \n\"But I think from what I see out there, it is a little bit more nervous, a little bit more, I would say, unstable in different corner phases, maybe.

        "article_text": "The US has been unable to meaningfully respond to the Myanmar earthquake due to the Trump administration's decision to slash foreign aid, according to three former senior US officials.\nOne former US Agency for International Development (USAID) mission director for Myanmar told the BBC that \"America has been on the sidelines\" after the disaster.\n\"The US basically was not there for the rescue-window period,\" said another official. All three suggested the deep cuts to aid probably cost lives.\nA 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, leaving at least 2,700 people dead, more than 4,500 injured and hundreds still missing, according to the country's military. Those figures are expected to rise.\nThe former USAID officials said the agency mobilised Disaster Assistance Response Teams (Darts) from the US after previous major earthquakes. Comprised of highly trained rescuers, sniffer dogs and specialist equipment, the teams are immediately made ready then dispatched when the affected country requests them.\nA typical deployment, like that sent to the Turkey-Syria earthquake in 2023, could comprise some 200 people - the majority of them rescue workers. US teams are often the biggest of all foreign assistance groups on the ground.\nThe US Department of State said on Monday a US team based in the region was on its way to Myanmar. It is believed to comprise three people who are advisers, not rescuers. \nThe state department also said it was donating $2m (\u00a31.6m) to humanitarian assistance organisations to support earthquake-affected communities. This figure is significantly smaller than previous US government donations during disasters, according to the former officials.\nPresident Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk is finalising the shutdown of USAID after weeks spent dismantling the agency and placing staff on administrative leave. Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".\nOn Friday, after the earthquake struck, the White House attempted to mobilise a Dart team, according to Andrew Natsios, who served as USAID administrator in George W Bush's administration. But, he said, it couldn't because key officials were on administrative leave.\n\"The problem is they fired most of the 500 people that make up the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, so obviously there are no people [from the bureau] to be on the Dart team to be sent - and the people have to be trained and be familiar with disaster relief operations,\" he said.\nStaff at the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance received letters of termination the day the earthquake struck, said Chris Milligan, who served as USAID Mission Director in Myanmar from 2012 to 2016.\n\"The employees\u2026 were told to go home by one o'clock. Everyone was told. All employees in that building were told to go home at one o'clock, and then they were told later to come back,\" said Mr Milligan.\n\"It shows the lack of management and the confusion that there was an earthquake earlier, and they didn't have the foresight to say 'Okay, let's retain these people'.\"\nTwo of the former USAID officials said the administration couldn't deploy US search and rescue teams, sniffer dogs and specialist equipment to Myanmar because logistics contracts to transport them from Virginia and California had been cancelled as part of the cuts, led by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\n\"It is the first time that I can think of that the US has simply not responded meaningfully to a major disaster,\" said Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) from 2013 to 2016.\nHe said for the last few decades, with every disaster on this scale, the US would be the largest and most capable team on the ground.\n\"You've got 75 to 100 people, the dogs and it's a pretty substantial lift [which] you've got to get there, operating and excavating piles, within the first really four days.\"\n\"The US basically was not there for the rescue window, period. And it's too late,\" said Mr Konyndyk.\nIt's unlikely the agency could reactivate logistics contracts in time for a Dart team to Myanmar in time to save lives, he said. \"If you wanted to issue new ones, the people who could issue new contracts and do the tenders for that, they've all been fired,\" explained Mr Konyndak.\nThe US state department rejects the notion that the cuts have impacted disaster relief in Myanmar.\nThe department had partners it worked with \"that may not require us to be physically present\", spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said on Monday.\n\"With the reform that the government is going through with the lead of President Trump\u2026 certain things won't necessarily look the same.  But the success in the work and our impact will still be there,\" she said.\nHowever, Mr Konyndyk described the claim as \"fantasy land\".\n\"You can't pull people out of a building virtually, you can't excavate, you can't do live rescues from a collapsed building without boots on the ground,\" he said.\nChris Milligan, the former USAID mission director for Myanmar, said the rescue capacity available in the United States would double the capacity already on the ground in Myanmar.\n\"This is the new normal. This is what it looks like when the United States sits on the international sidelines, when the United States is a weaker international player, when it cedes the space to other global players like China,\" said Mr Milligan.\nThe state department told the BBC it did not intend to deploy a Dart team to Myanmar, adding it was continuing many existing lifesaving programs and strategic investments that \"strengthen our partners and our own country\".\nA state department spokesperson said: \"USAID has contracts in place with Urban Search and Rescue Teams to assist in responding to disasters.\"\n\"[A] USAID team of humanitarian experts based in the region are traveling to Burma to assess additional needs,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\"A Dart is essentially a coordination mechanism. We are able to coordinate with our partners for this specific response without a Dart. Every response is different,\" added the spokesperson.\nAdditional reporting by Alex Lederman",

        "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/d4f6/live/3b43abe0-1089-11f0-ac9f-c37d6fd89579.jpg",
        "article_text": "Is it simply the modern language of football? Or just \"jargon\" dressing up the game's time-honoured glossary of terms in fancy new clothes?\nFrom a \"low block\" to a \"high press\", football's phrase book has gained countless new entries in recent years that have become part of the conversations before, during and after games.\nThese words alone spark debate from supporters to players past and present, from the cynics who dismiss them, to the newer generation who embrace them as an integral part of the football experience.\nBBC Sport pundits Pat Nevin and Chris Sutton, who have to decide which to use or avoid, have outspoken views on the subject.\nFormer Scotland forward Nevin says: \"I think it's just jargon used in every industry. It is showing someone you're in a little cosy club. You are saying 'we know about these things' and it makes you sound a bit cleverer.\n\"It is saying 'we're in the club, we're in the know - you're not'. I never use them, or if I do I immediately apologise or flag it up. \n\"For instance, I might say a team is defending really deep, then add 'or as they say in the modern parlance, a low block'.\"\nSutton said: \"It's just the evolution of the game. They're just different words aren't they? I'm not one who gets too stuck in the past - but there might be one I take real umbrage with.\"\nSo what are these modern terms? And what do they really mean?\nThe official description, according to statisticians Opta and data firm Second Spectrum, is when \"a defensive team has recently lost the ball and has not had time to re-organise its defensive shape. [The team] is out of position, and is either pressing or actively moving to get back into a stable defensive position\".\nNevin: \"The gold standard of the new jargon. It says you probably don't know what you're talking about, but you want people to think you are.\n\"I have never used it, other than facetiously. There should be a ban on it. Let's invoke a three-strike-and-out transitions law. \n\"Use it once as a co-commentator and you get a stern look, twice a yellow card, then three times you're on your way.\n\"What does it mean? You've given the ball away again. That's it.\n\"When coaches say they have to work on transitions, they should just not give the ball away and be better.\"\nSutton: \"I've always thought transition is when you win the ball back. It's a change isn't it? It's what the word means. Change from defending to attacking.\"\nA \"low block\", as defined by Opta, is the starting position of your team from your own goal.\nInterestingly, Nottingham Forest - third in the Premier League and heading towards the Champions League - are currently second-lowest with a starting position of 39.6 metres, sandwiched in between Southampton (39.8 metres) and Ipswich Town (39.4 metres) who are both almost certainly heading back to the Championship.\nNevin: \"Nottingham Forest suggests an exception and a successful strategy, but my overall definition is it means you're not good enough as a team, you can't get the ball out, so you defend deep.\n\"There you go - it's defending deep. It's just easier to say 'we're playing in a low block' rather than admit you're not good enough to play out so we have to sit back and play on the break.\n\"It's a fairly modern, generational thing. You can spot it a mile away. You can't wear a big sticker saying 'I've got my coaching badges' but this is almost telling people you've read the manuals and you've got your badges.\"\nSutton: \"It's the new phrase for defending your own box or defending deeply. I don't know where some of these phrases come from.\"\nThis is a defensive tactic where a team places its defenders higher up the pitch. Much focus has been placed on the \"high line\" Ange Postecoglou employs at Tottenham Hotspur, but the current highest line in the top flight is Manchester City at 45.9 metres.\nNevin: \"This is the one I'm absolutely fine with, because it is descriptive and perfectly explains what is happening to someone who may not know football very well. \n\"It's probably much older than the rest of the cliches and I would say it would have been used when I played.\"\nSutton: \"Fine by me. Making sure the distance between defenders and midfield isn't too great, teams can't play through out and you look to catch careless forwards offside. \n\"If you use this phrase, listeners or viewers will understand exactly what you mean.\"\nThis means defending high up the pitch to force the opposition into mistakes.\nNevin: \"New jargon. Been done for years. It's not a new Pep Guardiola thing. 'The Crazy Gang' at Wimbledon used to do it when I played and were brilliant at it.\n\"The old phrase was 'closing down'. You close the opposition down and get right in their faces high up the pitch. It's been rebranded as some new concept but every team used to do it.\n\"The recent great Barcelona sides were the high watermark, but it started in the 1970s when Johan Cruyff used to do it with Ajax. I did it for the first time in under-15s football at Celtic Boys Club.\n\"When I played, we usually did with a sign, which could be anything, but the favourite sign was 'when you see that big useless centre-back get the ball, all go in to try and make him give the ball away'.\"\nSutton: \"If someone talked to me about a 'high press' when I was playing, I would have thought they were telling me to iron my shirt.\n\"It's closing down and I suspect Herbert Chapman's great Arsenal side in the 1930s was doing this.\n\"It's a classic from people who think football didn't exist before 2010 and the '60s, '70s and '80s never happened. Do they think players of that era just stood around in a rigid 4-4-2 and didn't run or close down?\"\nWimbledon - pioneers of the high press?\nThis is when teams try to win the ball back quickly after conceding possession, to avoid being hit on the counter-attack by their opponents and potentially starting an attack of their own.\nNevin: \"It's not one I've come across too much but you press up to try and retrieve the ball immediately. Seems simple enough.\"\nSutton: \"I used this phrase north of the border and got absolutely rinsed by my fellow pundits. \n\"I meant when you won the ball back high up quickly by shutting down the opposition. Just another version of the press, and you're then on the counter-attack.\"\nHigh turnovers, as measured by Opta metrics, are \"the number of possessions that start in open play and begin 40 metres or less from the opponent's goal\".\nNevin: \"Of limited use. Winning the ball back high up the pitch.\"\nSutton: \"When someone mentions 'turnovers' to me I think of the apple things you used to buy in shops. \n\"You hear all this stats-based stuff now and it's basically winning the ball in the opposition half, that's all.\"\nSpurs boss Postecoglou called this \"the most useless statistic in world football. Seriously, it could fall off your backside, fall to somebody on the halfway line who scores and it's an assist. It doesn't impress me\".\nThe Opta definition is simple - the player who passes the ball to the player who scores.\nNevin: \"I like assists because I got far more assists than goals in my playing career, but Ange makes a great point. I used to keep a record of them. I agree with Ange, but as a phrase people do know what it means.\n\"I was always a bit miffed on the other side of that argument when I beat seven men, drew the keeper and passed it to John Aldridge to tap in at Tranmere.\"\nSutton: \"I take Ange's point. There could be a proper assist but what if the ball hits you on the backside? Is that really an assist? \n\"And what about when a player lets the ball run through his legs, or draws a defender out of position. That's one for the nerds and laptop crunchers.\"\nUsually the assist maker, Nevin celebrates a rare goal instead\nThis is measured by simply adding assists and goals.\nNevin: \"I hate the wording but I'm OK with the concept. I think the new purveyors of football parlance need to up their game a bit here. It needs a better phrase. Very simplistic this one, but I'm fine with what it stands for.\"\nSutton: \"It used to just be goals, but now this has been added. Next throw-ins and corners will be in there, all sorts of things. I think people do get what it means, though.\"\nTypically a striker (often wearing number nine) dropping deeper into midfield to link play, disturb the opponents' defence and make space for others, rather than playing in the traditional forward's role.\nNevin: \"I'm absolutely OK with this. The first time it was used to me was in 1982 at the European Under-18 championships when I was with Scotland. We won it in Finland and I was player of the tournament. We beat Czechoslovakia in the final so I was very happy with it.\n\"The coaches were Andy Roxburgh and Walter Smith. Andy ended up becoming Uefa's first technical director. He used a phrase 'unreal nine' or 'false nine'. It simply means no-one playing as as a traditional centre forward. It is a false striker.\n\"We rotated it with Scotland between myself, Ally Dick of Spurs and Gary Mackay of Hearts. We had two wide attackers and a false nine but all three of us could do all three jobs.\"\nSutton: \"What is the difference between a 'false nine' and 'number 10'? Think of Roberto Firmino at Liverpool. Someone who is essentially a forward who drops deep to show for the ball and link everything.\n\"At Blackburn when we won the title, we played 4-4-2 but a striker would drop deep when the opposition had the ball to attach themselves to a midfielder. Is that the same thing?\"\nThree phrases for the price of one. Effectively a defensive midfielder - or two - used by some teams to act as a shield for defence and link the whole side together. As the word means, \"a central point\".\nNevin: \"It's just a new name for the deep-lying central midfield player. In South America they would call that a 'five'. It is trying to pigeonhole all of them into one simple term.\n\"Chelsea play with two pivots, two 'sixes'. It's 4-3-3 with two deep-lying midfield players. It was used with Scotland when I played. Graeme Souness could do that easily and brilliantly.\n\"Chelsea do it all the time with Moises Caicedo and they have Enzo Fernandez, Romeo Lavia and are asking Reece James to do it as well.\"\nSutton: \"I don't know where this 'pivot' thing came from. It was a defensive midfielder, then a holding midfielder - and now we've got pivot.\n\"The 'pivots' I played with were Neil Lennon at Celtic and David Batty at Blackburn. Strong defensive holding midfield players.\"\nA full-back who moved into a more central possession when their team has the ball. Can be an extra midfielder and helps both attacking and defensive strategies.\nNevin: \"Stevie Clarke and myself did this at Chelsea. It can be described, as it used to be, as an underlapping full-back, someone stepping into midfield. [Inverted full--back] is an upgrade linguistically and one I don't mind.\n\"When I hear hybrid full-back, I can just say I won't be using that one and never will.\"\nSutton: \"I always think about left-footers playing on the right and vice-versa here, enabling them to step inside into midfield. We had Mark Bowen at Norwich City but we used to just call them attacking full-backs.\n\"As for hybrid' - that just makes me think of cars.\"\nThis is taken to mean the spaces between the edge of the penalty box towards the 'D' on either side of the area.\nNevin: \"Instantly droppable. Nonsensical. It only exists when a little gap opens up, basically just looking for a space between the striker and the midfielder. I don't think it's a very helpful phrase and is pretty meaningless.\"\nSutton: \"An absolute no-no. It's simply wrong. What a load of nonsense.\n\"How can you have a half-space? A space is a space is a space. If I dig a hole it's a hole. It is not a half-hole.\nThis phrase is believed to have originated in American football to describe an area of the field that forms around the quarterback on passing plays.\nNevin: \"Pockets of space is telling people to find space, It's just new words for the same thing.\"\nSutton: \"I get this a bit more. I think that's allowed. You can also call it a zone.\n\"I think this is the space in between the opposition defence and midfield, in the wider channels when teams play with three forwards and the highest forward will drop into spaces.\n\"As a description people will understand what you're talking about.\"\nBayern Munich and Germany's Thomas Muller has been bestowed with his own positional term\nThis is used to describe spaces between lines line of forwards and midfield players or midfield players and defenders.\nNevin: \"Teams never stand in straight lines, which is the silliness of all of this. If the formation has what you might call 'lines', you're trying to find the gaps and spaces between those lines.\n\"The last thing you do is go there between the line. You have to arrive when the ball arrives in there. That's the skill Cole Palmer is the best at it in the Premier League. Never stand there - always arrive there.\"\nSutton: \"I don't know who thought of this. Teams don't just line up in straight lines in a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2. \n\"The term itself presumably means you try to play through these so-called 'lines', mainly between the midfield and attack.\"\nAnd one to watch out for...\nThis was coined by, and has been used for, Bayern Munich's Germany attacker Thomas Muller and translates to \"space investigator\".\nMuller described himself as \"an interpreter of space\".\nNevin: \"I'll leave the German to others.\"\nSutton: \"Does what it says on the tin.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTonali's goal - a cross?

        "article_text": "Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet has barely been acknowledged in art history. But not only did she help her stepfather Claude, she created her own fine works \u2013 often of the same scenes as him.\nHaystack at Giverny, Poplars at the Water's Edge, Morning on the Seine. These painting titles bring only one name to mind \u2013 the great Claude Monet, whose flickering evocations of light and atmosphere are the cornerstone of Impressionism.\u00a0\nBut\u00a0while Monet painted\u00a0these very subjects, the paintings\u00a0belong to the oeuvre of his stepdaughter, and subsequently daughter-in-law, Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet (1865\u20131947). She learned to paint at Monet's shoulder, and exhibited and sold her work through the leading Parisian dealers of the time. Her finest paintings suggest an artist of such flair that you wonder how she has slipped from history's grasp.\u00a0\nA new exhibition and accompanying monograph \u2013 the artist's first \u2013 seeks to restore her reputation.\u00a0Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet in the Light\u00a0at The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana, brings together 40 of her paintings, along with sketchbooks, photographs and letters, establishing not just her impressionist credentials, but her role as Monet's assistant and companion on\u00a0plein air\u00a0painting expeditions \u2013 the only one of his children, blood-related or otherwise, whose passion for painting mirrored his own.\nThe difficulty of extracting Hosched\u00e9-Monet from history has been compounded by the fact that few of her 300-ish works are in public collections. In her native France, the former Mus\u00e9e Municipal de Vernon, near the Normandy village of Giverny, where the Monet family lived for decades, holds the largest number \u2013 eight paintings and one pastel \u2013 and was\u00a0valiantly renamed the Mus\u00e9e Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet last year to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Impressionism. Meanwhile Paris's Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (widely regarded as the best collection of Impressionist art)\u00a0has only a further two \u2013 neither of which, at the time of writing, is on display.\nThere are no Hosched\u00e9-Monet paintings in British public collections at all, and in the US, only one, The Weeping Willows on the Lily Pond at Giverny (c 1893-7) at the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio. The Indiana exhibition is the artist's first solo show on US soil, in fact, and an indication that her reputation is finally growing.\n\"While Hosched\u00e9-Monet's work remains relatively unknown and somewhat underappreciated in the marketplace, it is clear that she is gaining more recognition with collectors and institutions,\" says Julia Leveille, head of modern-day auctions at Sotheby's New York.\" Strong prices have been set for her work at auction recently, and we are excited to see where her market goes from here.\"\nHosched\u00e9-Monet was the daughter of Eugene Hosched\u00e9, a wealthy businessman and connoisseur of avant-garde painting. \u00c9douard Manet, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt and of course Monet were regular guests at his beautiful homes on the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and at his estate at Montgeron, on the city's edge.\u00a0\nHosched\u00e9-Monet was 11 when she first met Claude Monet in 1876. The then-35-year-old had been commissioned by her father to paint a quartet of panels for the dining room at Montgeron. Hosched\u00e9 was an important early patron of Monet's \u2013 in fact, it was he who bought Impression, Sunrise (1872), the painting that gave Impressionism its name.\u00a0\n\"I remember his arrival. He was introduced to me as a great artist, and he had long hair,\" she recollected in autobiographical notes she wrote towards the end of her life, which her brother Jean-Pierre then used as a basis for a personal and intimate account of Monet's life and family at Giverny. \" That struck me, and I immediately had sympathy for him because we could tell he was fond of children.\"\nIn her notes, Hosched\u00e9-Monet also singled out Monet's Springtime or The Reader (1872) as the painting she loved most in her father's considerable collection. She was \"deeply struck\", she said, by the touches of sunlight on the skirt of the woman \u2013\u00a0Monet's first wife, Camille.\nThe six months Monet spent at Montgeron in 1876 led to a magnificent set of paintings that includes the much-loved Turkeys and Willows at the River's Edge, though they did not remain in Hosched\u00e9's possession for long. Dire financial pressures forced him to sell most of his collection in 1878, along with both of his homes.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Monet changed the way we see London\n\u2022 The overlooked painting that unlocked Impressionism\n\u2022 The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\nMonet brought Hosched\u00e9, his wife Alice and their six children (Marthe, Blanche, Suzanne, Jacques, Germaine, and Jean-Pierre) to live with him, Camille and their two sons Jean, 11, and newborn Michel, at his home in V\u00e9theuil, northwest of Paris.\nCamille's\u00a0health deteriorated post-partum,\u00a0however, and in 1879 she died, after which Alice and Monet entered into \"what we believe was a domestic partnership,\" says Haley Pierce, co-curator of Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet in the Light. But they didn\u2019t marry until 1892, after Hosched\u00e9 had passed away. [Hosched\u00e9] had been estranged from the family for a while at this point.\"\nJuvenalia aside, the earliest works in the show date from 1882, when the newly-merged family rented a house in the seaside resort of Pourville, near Dieppe. Monet's painting Cliff Walk at Pourville features the then-17-year-old Hosched\u00e9-Monet with her elder sister, Marthe, and Hosched\u00e9-Monet filled a sketchbook with her own sunlit views.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn spring 1883, Monet moved the family to Giverny, where Hosched\u00e9-Monet began to paint in earnest. Delighted by her enthusiasm, he began taking her with him on his outdoor\u00a0painting expeditions. According to the biography of Hosched\u00e9-Monet's which her brother Jean-Pierre also wrote, \"she helped him in all circumstances\u2026 transporting his canvases and easel as well as her own. She did it all with the help of a wheelbarrow, following elusive paths, across fields and meadows sometimes drenched in dew. That was the case, for example, with his morning views of the Seine. Here again, she would help her stepfather by taking up the oars of the canoe.\"\nMonet also suggested exhibitions she might enjoy. In 1891, for instance, he asked his friend Gustave Geffroy, an influential critic, to obtain a pass for her to the Salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and later that year, took her with him to dine at the home of the British artist James McNeill Whistler in London (they were visiting her brother Jacques in Lymington) and to see the famous Peacock Room that Whistler created for shipping magnate Frederick Leyland's mansion near Hyde Park.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nMonet's 1887 painting In the Woods at Giverny: Blanche Hosched\u00e9 at Her Easel with Suzanne Hosched\u00e9 Reading, confirms that he and Hosched\u00e9 set up their easels within spitting distance of each other, or even, if she is the figure in the white dress at an easel in John Singer Sargent's oil sketch, Monet in his Bateau Atelier (also 1887), squashed together in the floating studio which Monet designed to paint while drifting along the river.\nUnsurprisingly, then, Hosched\u00e9-Monet's paintings often share her mentor's visual vocabulary: Shadows on the Meadow (Giverny, the Ajoux plain) matches his Spring Landscape at Giverny (1894) for instance, and\u00a0The Small Grainstacks (Les Moyettes) (c 1894) his\u00a0Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (1890-91). Julie Manet, daughter of the impressionist Berthe Morisot and Manet's brother Eug\u00e8ne, would also describe two of Blanche's paintings of \"trees reflected in the Epte [that] are very like Monsieur Monet's painting\" while visiting Giverny in 1893.\u00a0\nAs Hosched\u00e9-Monet's great-nephew, the art historian Philippe Piguet, further explains, \"her touch is more emphatic, out of concern for capturing what she saw on her canvas rather than what she felt\" \u2013 meaning that Hosched\u00e9-Monet's paintings can be described as more solid or direct in their rendering and composition, and less atmospheric, as compared to Monet. She also preferred to paint a subject from varying viewpoints, he adds, rather than, as Monet did, at different times of day.\nConsider her painting Haystack at Giverny alongside the Monet Haystacks at Giverny (1893) that was\u00a0sold at Sotheby's last year. \"They're at the same or approximate location, but she has distinctly chosen a different view,\" says Pierce. \"Her painting is also more solid. She has less interest in the quality of atmosphere, and more in really getting down her subject. Her compositions are very well thought out.\"\nBy now, Hosched\u00e9-Monet was blooming. The previous year, the US artist Theodore Robinson noted in his diary: \"I saw some things by Mlle Blanche, she has improved greatly since I saw her work last \u2013 a spring landscape, sold to [the Chicago millionaire] Potter Palmer quite charming.\" Her rapid progress excited Monet, too: away in Norway in 1895, he wrote to Alice, \"I can't wait to see what she has done in my absence, especially from what you tell me\".\u00a0\nIn 1897, Hosched\u00e9-Monet married Jean and they moved to Rouen, but returned to Giverny at weekends. For a time, her upward trajectory continued \u2013 in 1905, she began exhibiting with the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in Paris, and in 1907 the Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Rouennais \u2013 but when Jean had a serious fall in 1912, she gave up painting to care for him.\nWhen Jean died two years later, Hosched\u00e9-Monet returned to live at Giverny, where the recently widowed Monet was panic-stricken that he was losing his sight and finding it difficult to work. Her decision delighted his friends. Geffroy told her he was \"happy for him and happy for you. Your mutual misfortune makes your reunion stronger.\"\nHer reassuring presence gave Monet the strength he required to begin the monumental compositions of water lilies that occupied his final years and which he hoped would create\u00a0\"the illusion of an endless whole\". The exhibition includes a photograph of him working on these \"Grand Decorations\", as he called them, with Hosched\u00e9 Monet at his side.\u00a0\nMonet's close friend, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, later wrote that she had prepared the canvas grounds, but Hosched\u00e9-Monet refuted the claim. \"Contrary to what has been said and what has been written, I didn't make a brushstroke on [Monet's] canvases. It would have been a sacrilege.\" She also described Monet's death in 1926: \"It was the soul of the house who left\u2026 Everything here was illuminated by him.\"\nWith Michel's approval, Hosched\u00e9-Monet remained at Giverny for the rest of her life, caring for the house and studio, and tending to Monet's beloved gardens. She resumed painting again almost immediately, and in 1927\u00a0had her first solo exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Critics took great interest in her renaissance,\u00a0with one from newspaper Le Peuple proclaiming her \"more than the heiress of a great name\".\nImpressionism lost its grip on the art world almost as soon as Monet died, but Hosched\u00e9-Monet always remained loyal to her mentor's painting style. We might see her as the comet's tail of that hugely influential artistic movement, though perhaps her greatest contribution to it was her steadfast support. \"Without her, Claude Monet would have lived in an isolation that would have killed him,\" wrote the art dealer Ren\u00e9 Gimpel. \"It was she who kept him alive for us, posterity must not forget her.\"\nBlanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet in the Light is at the The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana until 15 June.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0\nsign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.For more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on \nFacebook, \nX and \nInstagram\n.",

        "article_text": "A growing confrontation between Israel and Turkey over influence in Syria is posing a serious challenge for Syria's fragile new government.\nOn Wednesday night, Israel bombed several military targets in Syria, including two airports \u2013 Hama military airport and the T4 base near Homs.\nSyria's foreign ministry said the bombardment virtually destroyed the Hama base.  A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured.\nThe air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey.\nShortly afterwards, Israel's foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel's defence minister warned Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country.\nAnkara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa's new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria's T4 and Aleppo airbases.\nSome analysts compared Israel's intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation.\nRelations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide.\nThat regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria.\nAfter the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region.\nBut foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.\nSyria's new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel.  Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country.\nHe has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.\nHis top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.\nBut Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.\nOnce an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.\nSince he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.\nIt has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.\nIsraeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.\nEarlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.\nAnother four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.\nSince then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.\nCharles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".\nSince the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria, the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".\nMany Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.\nSome say that view is now changing.\n\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"\nSyria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.\nAhmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.\nAt least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.\nThose former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.\nSyrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.\nBut outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil.",

A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured.The air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey.Shortly afterwards, Israel's foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel's defence minister warned Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country.Ankara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa's new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria's T4 and Aleppo airbases.Some analysts compared Israel's intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation.Relations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide.That regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria.After the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region.But foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.Syria's new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel. Israel attacks on Syria bases a warning sign for Turkey2 hours agoShareSaveLucy WilliamsonBBC Middle East correspondentShareSaveEPAIsrael has repeatedly carried out air strikes on Syrian bases since the fall of AssadA growing confrontation between Israel and Turkey over influence in Syria is posing a serious challenge for Syria's fragile new government.On Wednesday night, Israel bombed several military targets in Syria, including two airports \u2013 Hama military airport and the T4 base near Homs.Syria's foreign ministry said the bombardment virtually destroyed the Hama base. Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country.He has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.His top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.But Israel has not made that easy. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.Ahmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.At least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.Those former armed forces were once backed by Iran.",

        "article_text": "Paul Mescal and Barry Keoghan have been confirmed as part of the all-star line-up who will play members of the Beatles in four major new films about the band.\nNormal People and Gladiator II actor Mescal will portray Sir Paul McCartney, while Saltburn star Keoghan will step into Ringo Starr's shoes.\nThe acting supergroup will also feature Harris Dickinson, who was most recently seen opposite Nicole Kidman in Babygirl, as John Lennon.\nAnd Joseph Quinn will go from Marvel's Fantastic Four to the Fab Four, playing George Harrison in the big-screen quadrilogy, which will be directed by Sir Sam Mendes.\nThe Oscar-winning director was joined by the four actors for the announcement at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas on Monday.\nEach film will focus on a different member of the legendary group.\n\"Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys,\" Sir Sam told the event. \"They intersect in different ways - sometimes overlapping, sometimes not.\n\"They're four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply. But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history.\"\nThe films will be released \"in proximity\" to each other in April 2028.\nThe director explained: \"I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right.\"\nPaul Mescal, 29, shot to fame in the BBC's Normal People in 2020. He went on to star in acclaimed films Aftersun, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and All of Us Strangers,  and he played the lead in the Gladiator sequel. As well as portraying Sir Paul McCartney, the Irish star is about to be seen as another British creative genius, William Shakespeare, in the film adaptation of award-winning novel Hamnet.\nHarris Dickinson has become a star thanks to Maleficent, The King's Man, Triangle of Sadness and Where the Crawdads Sing, before playing Kidman's love interest in Babygirl. The 28-year-old Brit also received a Bafta TV Award nomination for A Murder at the End of the World, and is among the bookmakers' favourites to be the next James Bond.\nBarry Keoghan bears perhaps the closest resemblance to his Beatle - drummer Ringo. The Irish actor is the oldest of the acting quartet at 32, and is one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, having been nominated for an Oscar for The Banshees of Inisherin before leading the cast of cult hit Saltburn.\nJoseph Quinn played Eddie Munson in the fourth season of Netflix's Stranger Things, was in A Quiet Place: Day One, and appeared alongside Mescal in Gladiator II. Before appearing as guitarist Harrison, the 31-year-old Londoner will be seen as Johnny Storm/Human Torch in The Fantastic Four: First Steps and two Avengers films.\nAlthough several previous movies like Backbeat, Nowhere Boy and I Wanna Hold Your Hand have depicted The Beatles, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.\nSir Sam called the films the \"first bingeable theatrical experience\", adding: \"Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house.\"\nOn stage, Dickinson, Mescal, Keoghan and Quinn recited from the band's song Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: \"It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill, you're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.\"\nThey then gave a Beatles-style synchronised bow.\nFormed in 1960, the original band transformed youth culture and changed the course of musical history.\nRestlessly imaginative and experimental, they had an uncanny ability to communicate sophisticated musical ideas to a mass audience, on albums including Revolver, Sgt Pepper's and The White Album. \nDespite splitting in 1970, the quartet remain the biggest-selling band of all time.\nOnly two members survive.

He goes and says thank you for all the hard work that all the sports science guys, physios and everybody involved in the recovery have done for him to be able to be in the condition that he is.\n\"I think he lifted the stadium, the energy and great to have him back.\"\nArsenal have struggled to break teams down in Saka's absence and that has been made worse with season-ending injuries to Havertz and Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus that derailed their Premier League title bid.\nThe pattern of them having lots of possession and not creating goalscoring opportunities is one supporters have seen a lot this season, and was shown again in the first half before makeshift striker Mikel Merino scored the 37th-minute opener.\nCheered by fans when his name was read out, Saka received a standing ovation when he warmed up for the first time and again when he returned to the pitch for the first time since December.\nArsenal supporters, and the club, know how important he is, and with the Champions League the only trophy left available to them this season, they need him to have any chance of getting past European champions Real Madrid in the last eight.\nThe stats back up the impact Saka has when he is in the side too. \nIn the 16 Premier League games when he was available before his injury, the Gunners scored 34 goals at a rate of 2.1 per game.\nIn the 13 he subsequently missed, they scored 19 at a rate of 1.5 per match.\nTheir points per game dropped from 2.1 to 1.9 in the time he was sidelined, while the expected goals also dropped from 1.9 to 1.2 per match and big chances per game also falling from 3.4 to 2.4 without him.\n\"It's clear to see Arsenal's fall away in the Premier League [since his injury]. There is a huge reliance on Saka and, while he has been out, they have hugely missed him.\" former Brighton striker Glenn Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"He is back now and just in time for Real Madrid next week. It's a huge game and he will have that firmly in his sights.\n\"I think the return of Saka not only lifts the players but the whole place. Arsenal have needed a lift in all honesty.\"\nThe win over Fulham moved them to within nine points of league leaders Liverpool but the Gunners have played a game more and Murray admitted Saka's absence has been a huge reason for that.\n\"They have seen the Premier League title drifting away from them in recent weeks, they've not had a number nine and have been without their 'starboy' Saka,\" he added.\n\"There feels like there's been a lift in belief around the Emirates. Even if he is not at full tilt immediately he will bring so much to those around him.\n\"Saka is the difference maker. He just knows where to be, what to do. This time he arrives right on time at the back post to nudge the ball into an empty net.\"\nSaka scores seven minutes into return as Arsenal beat Fulham\nIt seems unlikely centre-back Gabriel is going to recover from a suspected hamstring injury in six days to play in a European quarter-final.\nHe is a key player for Arteta at both ends of the pitch and it will be a huge blow to Arsenal if ruled out of the Real Madrid tie.\nThe 27-year-old has scored three goals and has three assists in 28 Premier League games this season and no defender has scored more goals than the Brazilian's 17 since his debut against Fulham in September 2020.\nGabriel's injury will be assessed as Arteta confirmed: \"Gabi felt something in his hamstring.\n\"We don't know how big that is and with Jurrien as well. He was already struggling very early in the game. He managed to continue, at some point he couldn't, so that's the downside to it.\"\nArsenal's win percentage suffers when Gabriel is out of the team. The team's win percentage is 63.50% from the 159 games he has played since his Premier League debut compared to 40.90% in the 22 games he has missed in the league during that time.\nGabriel has been one of Arsenal's best performers in a challenging season and team-mate Declan Rice acknowledged his value to their Champions League chances.\n\"I don't know what's happened, I hope he's OK because he's been arguably our best player this season and we need him for big matches and big occasions.\" added Rice.\nDespite the setbacks and not being able to name a settled line-up for the majority of this campaign, Arteta said he was looking forward to future challenges. \n\"The good thing is that it's been like this the whole season.\" he added. \n\"You see [Gabriel] Martinelli today, you say we missed him three months. You see Bukayo four months, Kai four months, Gabi Jesus, almost the whole season. \n\"How we have managed to be where we are with all those injuries, Ben White hasn't participated at all this season.\n\"It's what it is.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's politics have shifted considerably over his decades in the public sphere. But one thing he has been consistent on, since the 1980s, is his belief that tariffs are an effective means of boosting the US economy.\nNow, he's staking his presidency on his being right.\nAt his Rose Garden event at the White House, surrounded by friends, conservative politicians and cabinet secretaries, Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on a broad range of countries \u2013 allies, competitors and adversaries alike.\nIn a speech that was equal parts celebration and self-congratulation, regularly punctuated by applause from the crowd, the president recalled his longtime support of tariffs, as well as his early criticism of free trade agreements like Nafta and the World Trade Organization.\nThe president acknowledged that he will face pushback in the coming days from \"globalists\" and \"special interests\", but he urged Americans to trust his instincts.\n\"Never forget, every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong,\" he said.\nNow, in a second term in which he is surrounded by like-minded advisers and is the dominant force in a Republican Party that controls both chambers of Congress, Trump is in a position to turn his vision of a new America-focused trade policy into reality. These policies, he said, had made the United States into a wealthy nation more than a century ago and would again.\n\"For years, hard working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense,\" he said. \"With today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again - greater than ever before.\"\nIt is still an enormous risk for this president to take.\nEconomists of all stripes warn that these massive tariffs \u2013 53% on China, 20% on the European Union and South Korea, with a 10% baseline on all nations \u2013 will be passed along to American consumers, raising prices and threatening a global recession.\nKen Rogoff, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, predicted that the chances of the US, the world's largest economy, falling into recession had risen to 50% on the back of this announcement.\n\"He just dropped a nuclear bomb on the global trading system,\" Mr Rogoff told the BBC World Service, adding that the consequences for this level of taxes on imports into the US \"is just mind-boggling\".\nTrump's move also risks escalating a trade war with other countries and alienating allies that America has otherwise tried to strengthen ties with. The US, for instance, sees Japan and South Korea as a bulwark against Chinese expansionist ambitions. But those three countries recently announced that they would work together to respond to America's trade policies.\nIf Trump is successful, however, he would fundamentally reshape a global economic order that America had originally helped to construct from the ashes of World War 2. He promises that this will rebuild American manufacturing, create new sources of revenue, and make America more self-reliant and insulated from the kind of global supply chain shocks that wreaked havoc on the US during the Covid pandemic.\nIt's a tall order \u2013 and one that many believe to be highly unrealistic. But for a president who seems fixated on cementing his legacy, whether through ending wars, renaming geographic locations, acquiring new territory or dismantling federal programmes and its workforce, this is the biggest, most consequential prize to be won.\nIt would be, he styled, America's \"liberation day\".\nWhat appears clear, however, is that Wednesday's announcement, if he follows through, is almost certain to mark a historic change. The question is whether it will be a legacy of achievement or one of notoriety.\nTrump's speech was triumphant - one that belied the potentially high costs his moves would impose on the American economy and on his own political standing.\nBut, he said, it was worth it - even if, at the very end of his remarks, a small shadow of presidential doubt may have peaked through the bravado.\n\"It's going to be a day that - hopefully - you're going to look back in years to come and you're going to say, you know, he was right.\"\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

Why didn't we release those records? I didn't think they were essential. \n\"I might have thought they were good, I might have had fun making them... but over my entire work life, I felt like I released what was essential at a certain moment, and what I got in return was a very sharp definition of who I was, what I want to do, what I was singing about. \n\"And I still basically judge what I'm doing by the same set of rules.\"\nIn a video trailer for Tracks II, Springsteen added: \"I often read about myself in the '90s as having some lost period or something. \n\"And I really, really was working the whole time.\"\n\nFans will finally get to hear those \"lost\" songs in June. \nSpringsteen said they would offer a glimpse into the home recordings he made after the commercial success of Born To Run and Born In The USA freed him from the pressure of using commercial recording studios.\n\"The ability to record at home whenever I wanted allowed me to go into a wide variety of different musical directions,\" he said in a statement. \nThat includes the \"sonic experimentation\" of Faithless, a film soundtrack to a movie that never got made.\nOther unreleased albums include the country-leaning Somewhere North of Nashville, cut in May 1995; and Twilight Hours, an orchestrated pop album that was written and recorded in the same period as 2018's Western Stars.\nThere are also the \"richly-woven border tales\" of Inyo, whose song titles - including The Aztec Dance and Ciudad Juarez - suggest a Latin American influence.\nSpringsteen described the last disc, Perfect World, as \"the one thing on this that wasn't initially conceived as an album\", instead highlighting several songs he wrote with longtime collaborator Joe Grushecky in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nAs a first taste of the collection, he released Rain In The River, from Perfect World, whose muscular drums and squalling feedback showcase the raw power of his regular backing band E Street Band.\n\nThe announcement comes a month before Springsteen kicks off his European tour, with dates in Manchester, Liverpool, Marseille, Berlin and Prague, amongst others.\nThe 75-year-old recently vowed to keep playing live \"until the wheels come off\", but said he had scaled back his tours after his wife, Patti Scialfa, was diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer.",

        "article_text": "Wisconsin voters have elected a Democratic-backed judge to serve on the state supreme court, according to projections, following the most expensive judicial election in US history.\nSusan Crawford is on course to beat conservative rival Brad Schimel, which would keep intact the 4-3 liberal control of the Midwestern state's highest court. \nPresident Donald Trump's billionaire adviser Elon Musk was a prominent fundraiser in the campaign, and was the subject of Democratic attack ads. More than $100m (\u00a377m) was spent by the candidates and their allies, including $20m by Musk.\nThe result is expected to have far-reaching implications, potentially even affecting the balance of power in the US Congress.\nThat is because the state's supreme court is expected to play a key role in cases related to congressional redistricting ahead of midterm elections in 2026 and the next presidential election, in 2028.\nWith the majority of ballots tallied, Crawford had won about 54% of the vote, and Schimel had around 45%, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\nAddressing the fundraising by Musk, Crawford told supporters in her victory speech: \"Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale.\"\nThe Dane county judge was formerly a private lawyer for Planned Parenthood and she backed abortion rights during her campaign.\nAfter giving his personal backing to Schimel, Tuesday's result was a setback for Trump in a crucial swing state that he won by less than a percentage point during last November's presidential election.\nHowever, he took consolation from fellow Republicans managing to hold on to two congressional seats in Florida elections on Tuesday. \nThe contest was seen as a test of Musk's powerbroking status.

        "article_text": "Our lives are surprisingly dependent upon this extremely light and unreactive gas, yet supplies of it are remarkably fragile.\nNancy Washton remembers the sinking feeling she got when she heard her helium delivery wouldn't be arriving. In early 2022, she and her team of chemists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the United States were abruptly told by their supplier that they wouldn't get their usual shipment of the gas, which they use in a range of different experiments.\nShortages meant there wasn't enough to go around, and the laboratory would simply have to make do with less. In the first weeks of that year, the laboratory's supply dropped well below the 2,500 litres (660 gallons) it normally received. By April, just a couple of months later, it was getting less than half the helium it needed.\nWith a small fleet of instruments that require regular top-ups of liquid helium, the lab had no choice but to sacrifice the greediest of these in order to continue running the most important. Washton's own instrument of choice was a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer \u2013 a huge, hulking tower, capable of peering into the molecular structure of atoms. Such measurements can contribute to the development of new batteries and energy storage systems, for example.\nThe spectrometer was the only one of its kind in North America, and less than 12 months after its installation it was providing results that were potentially game-changing. When turned on samples of magnesium oxide, for example, it showed the\u00a0minerals are capable of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.\u00a0Such \"carbon mineralisation\" has long been explored as a way of combatting greenhouse gas emissions, but the results showed how useful these minerals could be.\n\"There had been no definitive evidence of carbonate formations on these particular types of magnesium oxides [before],\" says Washton.\u00a0\"I just could not believe the data. The fact that we had managed to get this data, and the beauty of the story it told, was just amazing,\" Washton says.\nBut then all of that work abruptly had to stop.\nThe rate at which the spectrometer consumed helium made it a problem. In a process Washton later described as \"traumatising\", the instrument was de-energised and mothballed, its experiments suspended. It would sit inert and useless for several months until more helium could be secured. Today, the device is back up and running \u2013 the lab has the helium it needs. For the time being.\nWhat is helium used for?\nHelium is an inert gas, which means that it does not react readily with other substances. It has the lowest boiling point of any element at -269C (-452F) and a low density.\nThe space industry uses helium to keep satellite instruments cool and to clean out rocket engines. It is also used to pressurise the fuel tanks of space rockets.\nHelium also cools equipment within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.\nHelium is often used to fill party balloons, weather balloons and airships due to its low density.\nDeep-sea divers rely on helium to control the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen they get from their breathing apparatus, since this helps to avoid decompression sickness.\nThe episode highlights how vulnerable helium supplies are and why there is now a desperate scramble around the world to find ways of conserving and recycling this crucial gas.\nThe shortages in 2022 didn't just affect researchers. You might not realise it, but many of the products and processes you encounter each day depend on helium.\nHospitals, for example, are the world's largest consumers of helium, accounting for around 32% of the global market. The gas is used to cool magnets in vital diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. Helium is also used in the manufacturing of the semiconductors (computer chips), which are at the heart of electronic devices. It's also used in welding and even pressurises the fuel tanks of rockets that put satellites into orbit. Plus, helium is part of the gas mixture that inflates car safety airbags.\nHelium is odourless, extremely light and, unlike another very light element once used in airships, hydrogen, it will never burst into flames. When cooled, it only condenses into a liquid at the stunningly low temperature of roughly 4.2 Kelvin, or -269C/-452F. Plus, under normal atmospheric conditions, helium will not freeze even at temperatures as low as absolute zero, or 0 Kelvin (-273C/-460F). This makes it incredibly useful.\u00a0\n\"Helium is a magical element,\" says Sophia Hayes, professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis. \"There is nothing else like it in the Universe.\"\nLiquid helium takes on strange properties when it is chilled almost to absolute zero, turning into a superfluid that flows without friction. Stir a cup of superfluid helium and the liquid inside would theoretically keep spinning forever. Superfluid helium has become vital for large-scale superconductors, such as those used by the Large Hadron Collider experiment at Cern on the border between Switzerland and France.\nBut since 2006, helium has repeatedly been in short supply. The most recent extended shortage started in January 2022 before easing the following year. But helium supplies have remained precarious, with producers struggling to keep up with demand.\nThat demand is only expected to rise further \u2013 with some analysts predicting that it will double by 2035 due to helium's key roles in semiconductor and electric vehicle battery manufacturing, as well as in aerospace applications.\nThere are only two sources of helium: the highly-energetic nuclear fusion reactions inside stars, including our Sun, and the slow decay radioactive elements in Earth's crust. Since we can't artificially manufacture helium with today's technology, that means it is essentially a finite resource. Instead, helium is typically mined alongside natural gas by drilling deep wells into the ground, but only a handful of companies across the world currently do this.\nHelium is also a remarkably uncooperative element. The extraction and burning of fossil fuels have caused increasing amounts of helium to build up in the Earth's atmosphere in recent decades, depleting the resource otherwise locked inside our planet.\nBut helium is so light that it is also slowly leaking out of the Earth's atmosphere and heading off into space. In its superfluid state, it has a habit of finding its way out of even the tiniest cracks and holes. It can even flow up walls in this superfluid state. That makes it difficult to handle and store \u2013 it can be easily lost after use.\nAll of this makes the helium supply chain fragile \u2013 resulting in four worldwide helium shortages in the last twenty years alone.\nThe most recent severe shortage in 2022 that scuppered some of Washton's research occurred after a series of fires at a major Russian gas processing plant in the Amur region of Siberia. The war in Ukraine compounded the problem by further choking supplies at the same time a helium plant in Qatar went offline for planned maintenance. Meanwhile, the crude helium enrichment unit at the US National Helium Reserve was shut down during the summer of 2021 and again for four months at the end of January 2022. The US shutdown removed around 10% of the global production capacity of helium from the supply chain. Taken together, these incidents led to a sudden shortage and highlighted just how vulnerable the world's helium supply could be. By 2023, the industrial sale price of helium had nearly doubled from what it was five years before, reaching an all-time high.\nAlthough helium production has since increased, the world yet again faces potential disruption, leaving market prices volatile. In September 2024, the EU began enforcing new sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, including banning imports of helium. While Russia accounts for only 1% of the EU's helium imports, the move marked a further tightening of supplies. On top of that, the sale of the world's largest helium reserve \u2013 the US Federal Helium Reserve \u2013 has triggered further uncertainty.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why the world is running out of sand\n\u2022\u00a0How Google's ballons surprised their creator\n\u2022\u00a0The world's forgotten greenhouse gas\nFor several decades, the US has supplied around one-tenth of the world's helium from an underground federal stockpile established a century ago near Amarillo, Texas. But in June 2024, the Bureau of Land Management, which ran the US helium reserve, sold the last gasp of federal helium to the German gas supplier Messer. Ahead of the handover, the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine released a report warning that the sale of the strategic reserve to a commercial company could heighten uncertainty in the helium market.\u00a0\nTrade bodies including The Compressed Gas Association and the Advanced Medical Technology Association \u2013 AdvaMed \u2013 urged the US government to delay the sale on the grounds that it risked a \"supply chain crisis\". And healthcare contractor Premier Inc, which sources helium on behalf of thousands of hospitals, suggested the sale could have a detrimental impact on patient care.\u00a0\nAlthough these fears are yet to be realised, there are signs that not all is going smoothly.\nWithin months of the sale, Messer was forced to request a temporary restraining order to prevent another shutdown of the crude helium enrichment unit \u2013 this was due to the expiry of a critical lease and a negotiation dispute. The company that ran the enrichment unit was later placed into receivership. Messer, however, says its helium system \"has been operating reliably and without interruption since we acquired it last June, and we anticipate smooth uninterrupted operations in the future\".\nBut a recent analysis of helium supplies suggests that this natural resource is likely to take on growing geopolitical importance over the coming years as demand and competition for the gas increases.\nThe US accounts for about 46% of the global supply of helium, followed by Qatar (38%) and then Algeria (5%). If US supplies were to be disrupted again, the impact would be felt around the world.\nYears of precarious helium supplies and price fluctuations, however, have also forced academic, commercial and clinical bodies to explore more sustainable modes of helium consumption. Firmly in their crosshairs are helium-hungry MRI machines.\nA standard MRI machine requires a little under 2,000 litres of liquid helium to cool its superconducting magnets. Each unit needs occasional top-ups and, without the cooling helium, its magnets would heat up, evaporate the helium reservoir, and expel it in a process called \"quenching\". It's rare, but dire: the helium is lost, and another couple thousand litres of the liquid is required to put the machine back into working order. If a quenching incident causes more serious damage, then the whole MRI machine might need replacing at great expense.\u00a0\nNow, a new breed of MRI machines that require significantly less helium are emerging. Many of these low-helium units need as little as one litre of helium to operate, sealing it in a closed system. In recent years, these machines have already begun appearing in hospitals and research institutions.\u00a0 \u00a0\nBut there are limits. These low-helium scanners are especially expensive, and it would still take many years to replace the more than 35,000 MRI machines that use superconductors worldwide.\nThe new scanners are also only capable of producing magnetic field strengths of around 1.5 Tesla \u2013 roughly half of what their beefier predecessors can put out. \"Higher-field-strength scanners have the potential to scan in finer detail and/or faster than lower-field-strength scanners,\" says Sharon Giles, director of clinical and research imaging operations at King's College London. The use of these low-helium scanners, then, is limited, although Giles says they're still capable of performing routine imaging in a lab setting.\nOther researchers have searched for ways to cut out helium entirely by developing superconducting materials that don't need to be cooled to such extremes.\nMore widely, researchers are starting to shore up their own supplies by recycling. Helium recovery systems can recapture evaporated helium that would otherwise be lost. \"It will allow us to recover about 90% of the helium that we purchase every year,\" says Nicholas Fitzkee, director of Mississippi State University's nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) facility, which is in the process of installing a recovery system. \"We did the calculations when we wrote the proposal and the total cost of the system was just over $300,000 (\u00a3238,000), and it should pay for itself within six years.\"\nBut installing helium recovery technology \u2013 complicated arrangements of pipes, tubing and headers that must be fed through a facility's instruments \u2013 is time-consuming and complex. These systems can fail, leak, and even when done right, Washton worries that some people may not fully appreciate their benefit. \"To make an argument, 'Hey, I need $600,000 (\u00a3476,000) for a couple of helium recovery units', people are like, 'Well, what's that gonna do for us? That's kind of like you're putting in new plumbing',\" she says, explaining that such work doesn't have the \"bling\" factor that helps justify certain other scientific investments.\nBut there may also be some signs of relief on the horizon. Qatar is on course to open a new helium plant by 2027, while other companies have started to look for previously untapped underground fields.\nIn 2016, the world's largest helium reserve was found in Tanzania. It is set to start production in 2025. This was actually the first helium gas field to be discovered deliberately, and the launch of operations there will mark the first time helium has been recovered at scale, rather than as a by-product of polluting natural gas extraction. Major helium reserves have also been discovered in China's Bohai Bay Basin.\nChristopher Ballentine, chair of geochemistry at the University of Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences, contributed to the scientific research that ultimately helped to locate the Tanzanian helium deposit. But he cautions against over-excitement. \"The challenge of finding significant helium deposits to meet the growing global demand requires significant finances and a long lead-in time,\" he says.\nVolatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource is \u2013 and how quickly its supply can be pinched off.\nWashton emphasises the risks: \"Imagine if there's just not enough helium, and your grandma can't get her MRI because its superconductor is dead. This is serious and we need to deal with it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

It is also used to pressurise the fuel tanks of space rockets.Helium also cools equipment within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.Helium is often used to fill party balloons, weather balloons and airships due to its low density.Deep-sea divers rely on helium to control the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen they get from their breathing apparatus, since this helps to avoid decompression sickness.The episode highlights how vulnerable helium supplies are and why there is now a desperate scramble around the world to find ways of conserving and recycling this crucial gas.The shortages in 2022 didn't just affect researchers. If US supplies were to be disrupted again, the impact would be felt around the world.Volatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource isYears of precarious helium supplies and price fluctuations, however, have also forced academic, commercial and clinical bodies to explore more sustainable modes of helium consumption.

Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nWe are only two races into the 2025 Formula 1 season and there has already been a major driver change with Red Bull promoting Yuki Tsunoda to replace Liam Lawson.\nTsunoda competes at his home grand prix in Japan this weekend as team-mate to world champion Max Verstappen for the first time, with New Zealander Lawson demoted to Racing Bulls. \nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions on the Red Bull situation and more before the race in Suzuka.\nWhat would be a good season for Yuki Tsunoda after the recent driver switch? - David\nRed Bull's decision to demote Liam Lawson after just two races and put Yuki Tsunoda in the second Red Bull alongside Max Verstappen is nothing less than a career lifeline for Tsunoda.\nThe 24-year-old Japanese was staring at the likely end of his career this season.\nThat's because he owed his seat at the second Red Bull team to Honda, and it is moving to Aston Martin for 2026, where there is no seat available to Tsunoda and no realistic prospect of one.\nWithout Honda, the chances of Racing Bulls keeping Tsunoda for 2026 were slim, when there are other Red Bull juniors coming along the conveyor belt.\nSo a seat alongside Verstappen this year gives him the opportunity to show once and for all that he deserves a long-time place in F1.\nBut what level of performance would do that?\nThe fact remains that Red Bull have a minimum level of expectation for their second driver - and that's to be within about 0.3 seconds a lap of Verstappen on a consistent basis.\nThat's what Tsunoda needs to do to convince Red Bull that he deserves to be considered as a contender for a seat in 2026.\nAnd realistically if he does not do that, he is unlikely to convince anyone else that he is worth investing in either.\nThis video can not be played\nHorner won't ask me to swap if leading Verstappen - Tsunoda\nIf Max Verstappen leaves Red Bull are they in even greater trouble than just losing their star driver? It seems like they'd be losing the only person who can drive their car, a situation that's seemingly self-inflicted. Are they likely to be making their 2026 car more driveable to mitigate this risk? - Tom\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Lawson-Tsunoda driver swap is that it gives another perspective on the state Red Bull are in with their car.\nVerstappen believes it is the fourth quickest car in F1 at the moment - so behind the McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari. Although on average qualifying pace in the three sessions so far, it is actually second fastest behind the McLaren.\nBut it may be that it is only both of those things with Verstappen in it.\nThe issue for Red Bull is that they have one genius-level driver and one average one, in F1 terms - and that remains the case with Tsunoda in the second seat, or at least that's what most would believe right now.\nSo it's almost a case of split the difference between the drivers to judge the level of the car.\nThe bottom line seems to be that the new Red Bull is simply not that good a car, and certainly one which is unpredictable and does not generate confidence in a driver. Even Verstappen finds it difficult to drive - but he is so good that he is able to coax a good lap time out of it.\nVerstappen is regarded by most as the best driver in F1 at the moment - so if that's true, it stands to reason that the car would be worse with pretty much anyone else in it.\nIt seems Red Bull have chased peak aerodynamic performance at the expense of drivability - which is ironic, because that is exactly the opposite of the philosophy that Adrian Newey has championed throughout his career.\nLegendary designer Newey, who stopped working on Red Bull in F1 last April, and has just come to the end of his first month with Aston Martin, has always believed that it was better to have slightly less downforce that the driver can use all of, than more theoretical downforce that can't be accessed because the car is too \"peaky\". Or, as Lawson put it, the \"window\" is too narrow.\nLike all teams, Red Bull designed the best car they could for the new season. The question that hangs over them now is, do they know how to fix it?\nThis video can not be played\nRed Bull's second seat dilemma - F1 Breakdown\nAfter another very dry sprint race in China I wonder again why F1 doesn't give the teams tyres that enables the drivers to race through a sprint. Surely the point of the sprint is it is fast, exciting and full of action? - Richard\nThis is a question about tyre management. The fact is that - with a few very limited exceptions - drivers have never been able to race flat out since Pirelli entered F1 as the tyre supplier in 2011.\nThat's not how their tyres work. Pirelli tyres have to be managed to stay within a temperature window.\nDrive them flat out and they overheat. And if they overheat, they rarely come back to optimum grip level. Sometimes this is even the case over a single qualifying lap.\nPirelli has been asked before to provide tyres that can be driven flat out, but so far it has not done so.\nThis video can not be played\nSwapped seats & shaky starts: What to know before Japanese Grand Prix\nIs this season a write-off for Aston Martin? - Carlos\nIt's not looking good so far, is it?\nOn average, the Aston Martin is the seventh fastest car over a single lap over the first three races of the season, including the China sprint. Only the Alpine, Sauber and Haas have been slower.\nIt's fair to say that Fernando Alonso has not had his best start to a season, and mistakes in qualifying at both races so far have hurt the team's ultimate potential.\nSo, it's not completely clear yet what the car's ceiling is.\nAston Martin came into this season with two main aims - to produce a more drivable car, and to prove that they could solve the correlation issues they have had between simulation and the real world and design upgrades that perform as expected.\nThe drivers say that it is more drivable than last year - it's just not that quick.\nIf they can prove their upgrades work, then the season will be at least a qualified success, regardless of the performance of the car to some extent.\nSo it is probably fair to wait for at least the first upgrade package - which would typically be expected around May some time - before forming any firm conclusions.\nHow to follow Japanese Grand Prix on the BBC\nTsunoda told to be 'as close to Verstappen as possible'\nIs there a circuit(s) you'd really want on the calendar that currently isn't on there? And at the expense of which current circuit(s)? I love Fuji and I'm not a fan of street circuits \u2013 RAP\nThe F1 calendar has a pretty good selection of circuits at the moment.\nThere are some obvious candidates in the United States - Road America and Laguna Seca are both great circuits. But then so is Austin, and both Miami and Las Vegas work for the sport on a financial level.\nBathurst in Australia is awesome - but not suitable for F1, sadly.\nAs for Fuji, great backdrop, when the clouds are not covering Mount Fuji, but as a circuit it is not a patch on Suzuka.\nThe one big miss in terms of the calendar is France. Somehow, it seems wrong not to have a grand prix in the country that gave birth to motorsport and hosted the first race with that title, even if Monaco is regarded as a sort of proxy French race.\nThe problem is that France's only circuits with licences for F1 are Paul Ricard and Magny-Cours. Uninspiring both.\nBut if the Sarthe circuit at Le Mans could be brought up to F1 standard and host a grand prix, that would be quite something.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nWhat's the future for F1 engines and why is it up for debate?",

        "article_text": "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing\nDriving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.\nIn nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.\nAlmost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.\nMyanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.\nWhat we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.\n\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days. \nHer 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha was a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.\n\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.\nWhen the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.\nSai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.\nWhen we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.\nEven before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.\nThis means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.\nThe military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.\nAnd so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.\nNeeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.\n\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.\nWorking under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.\nThe rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.\nSitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.\nOthers gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.\nAgonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.\nBut the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.\nAmong the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.\nMany of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.\nAccess to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.\nClose to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.\n\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.\nTheir bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.\nMyanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.\nParks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.\nMandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.\nBut tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.\n\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"\nShe works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.\n\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.\n\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.\nAnother elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"\nMost of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.\nParts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.\nShwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.\nThere were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.\nZar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.\nWe couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.\nAs the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.\nNan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.\n\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.\n\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced fresh import taxes on goods being imported to America in the latest escalation of the global trade war.\nThe UK has been hit with a 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which Trump says is a retaliation to UK tariffs on American goods, but uncertainty remains over the potential impact on British consumers.\nHere's how you and your money could be affected.\nThe tariffs Trump has just announced will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US.\nClarissa Hahn, economist at Oxford Economics, says this means that the initial impact of price rises will be on US consumers, as American firms are likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers.\nHowever, she adds people in the UK could subsequently be affected by the measures, which come into effect on 5 April.\nOne way is via the value of the pound and exchange rates, which dictate the cost to  UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. If import costs go up, these extra costs could be passed on to consumers through higher prices.\nFollowing Trump's speech on Wednesday, exchange rates between the dollar and pound fluctuated. If the value of the dollar strengthens as some economists have predicted, import costs could rise for UK firms importing goods.\nHigher prices in the UK could also \"prompt workers to demand higher wages\", which would further raise costs for businesses, according to Ahmet Ihsan Kaya, principal economist, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \nMs Hahn adds if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on extra costs to customers.\nHowever, some economists have suggested prices could also initially fall as a result of Trump's decision to impose tariffs.\nSwati Dhingra, economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US, may instead send them to countries such as the UK which don't have such steep tariffs, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods in the UK.\n\"Tariffs of the proposed magnitude are likely to prompt firms that export to the US to lower their prices to retain demand for their products,\" she suggests.\nBritish companies exporting goods to the US are set to be the hardest hit from the latest measures.\nThe UK exported almost \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. Other industries, which are big exporters to the US, include fishing and electronics.\nIf US demand for UK products dwindles due to the extra charges importers face, this could hit profit margins and ultimately lead to UK job cuts unless British firms find new customers outside the US.\nAccording to the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, Jaguar Land Rover and the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxford, appear to be the most exposed to US tariffs on cars.\nIt says more than 25,000 jobs in the UK car manufacturing industry \"could be at risk\" with a 25% tariff coming into effect on Thursday, with one in eight UK-built cars exported to the US.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is also heavily reliant on trade with the US, says Ms Hahn, of Oxford Economics. \nThe US makes up 40% of AstraZeneca's sales and 50% of GSK's. Although both British-headquartered firms have manufacturing facilities in America, raw ingredients for life-saving medicines and vaccines travel between the UK, EU and US. Under tariffs the firms could be hit with multiple tax charges as they cross borders to be developed.\nThere is also the issue of how tariffs work when they collide with pricing caps that both the NHS and other health organisations set for buying drugs in bulk.\nUK interest rates dictate the costs households have to pay to borrow money for things such as mortgages, credit cards and loans. Higher rates also boost returns for savers.\nThey are currently at 4.5%, but economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year.\nHowever, the Bank of England highlighted US tariffs as a reason why it avoided cutting rates further last month, saying economic and global trade uncertainty had \"intensified\". \nIf prices are pushed up for long enough to affect the rate of inflation - this could mean interest rates stay higher for longer.\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said it was Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\" and that would be \"looking very closely\" at the impact of tariffs.",

I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson will again caddie for Lottie Woad at the Augusta National Women's Amateur tournament\nIt was while standing on the 12th tee at Augusta National that Lottie Woad had one of those 'pinch me' moments.\nThe English amateur, from Farnham in Surrey, was seven holes away from securing a career highlight win that would kick-start a stellar 2024.\nIt was a year that started with her becoming the first European to claim the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) title at the home of the Masters - a title she will try to become the first to defend this week when the three-day competition starts on Wednesday.\nIt was a year in which the England Golf women's squad member played in her first majors, finished as top Briton at the Women's Open, helped win the Curtis Cup, and ended it as the world's number-one-ranked amateur.\n\"It was definitely a breakthrough year,\" the 21-year-old tells BBC Sport. \"Winning at Augusta was the highlight and that kicked off the whole year.\"\n\"I have respect for everyone playing the 12th hole because it looks bigger than it actually is, but there is not much room. It's probably like 20 feet deep max.\"\nAnd it was on the back nine at Augusta - where so many Masters dreams have flourished and floundered - that Woad managed to keep her nerve.\nThe 12th was among the pivotal holes and she had to steady herself to tackle one of the most daunting par-threes in golf.\nDozens of rounds have been ruined on this most picturesque of holes. Tiger Woods hit three balls in Rae's Creek, the water that protects the front of the green, on his way to a 10 in 2020, the year after he won his fifth Green Jacket.\n\"You're standing on the tee and you're just like, 'I'm on hole 12',\" she says.\n\"You're nervous but then you're also going 'I'm playing the 12th at Augusta', so it's not too bad.\"\nWoad, who went into the final round of the 54-hole event - of which the first 36 are played at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club - with a two-shot lead, marked a three on her card to stay at six under. \nBut up ahead American Bailey Shoemaker was putting the finishing touches to the first bogey-free round at Augusta in the five-year history of the ANWA. A sensational 66 set a target of seven under.\nA bogey on the par-five 13th meant Woad dropped two behind, but she produced a magical finish with three birdies in her final four holes to snatch victory on the final green.\nThe putt on the 18th was an 18-footer, downhill.\n\"It didn't have much break but it was pretty quick,\" she says.\n\"Then it went in and I've won at Augusta and everyone kind of went crazy.\"\nWoad's season was about to get a little more crazy. The victory opened the door to play the majors, the Chevron Championship two weeks later being the first.\nShe spent a hectic week catching up with friends and college work at Florida State University, where she is in the penultimate year of a sports management degree, before heading to Texas.\n\"My parents and coaches were at Augusta and they wanted to go home, so I was left on my own at my first major,\" she says.\n\"I had to get a local caddie, but I had a lot of confidence from Augusta, made the cut and was in contention.\" \nWoad finished joint 23rd, alongside England's Georgia Hall and Charley Hull, two of her \"favourite players\" that she had \"looked up to\" since concentrating on the sport from about the age of 13.\nShe had taken her first lessons, aged seven, with Farnham pro Luke Bone, who remains her coach.\nProgression to the England Girls followed by the age of 15 and, while perhaps not seen as the most naturally gifted golfer, Woad's work ethic impressed as she took advantage of resources not previously available to her.\n\"I had a putting coach, a strength and conditioning coach and a psychologist,\" she says.\n\"I was always pretty good at the long game, but I had to work a lot harder on my short game and I learned how to practise more effectively.\"\nShe went on to win the prestigious Girls Amateur Championship at Carnoustie in 2022, a decade after Hall triumphed in the event.\nWoad was back in Scotland for last year's Women's Open, which was held over the Old Course in St Andrews.\nShe had missed the cut at the US Women's Open and Evian Championship but arrived in Fife in buoyant mood for her fourth major.\nWoad would be in contention all week and finish joint 10th to win the Smyth Salver as the highest-placed amateur, with another highlight being a 60-yard chip-in eagle two on the par-four last in round three.\n\"That got me back into the top 10 going into final day. It was a really cool moment with the grandstand full of cheering people,\" she says.\n\"Then at the prize-giving I get to stand next to the winner, Lydia Ko. To see her lift that trophy motivates you.\n\"It was a perfect week. Home of golf, first Open - I couldn't have dreamed it better.\"\nThere was little time for celebration, though. The Curtis Cup, which pits Great Britain and Ireland's top female amateurs against their American counterparts, was the following week.\nThe Americans were favourites to win a fourth successive title after domineering victories in the previous three editions of the biennial event.\nBut GB&I were boosted by having Europe's victorious Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew as their leader.\nAnd Woad, who grew up 40 minutes from the Sunningdale Old Course that hosted the event, contributed 2\u00bd points in a nerve-shredding 10\u00bd-9\u00bd triumph.\nBy that point, Woad had ascended to top of the amateur rankings, which earned her the Mark H McCormack medal. Ko won the prize three successive times from its inception in 2011, while Ireland's Leona Maguire and rising US star Rose Zhang are also three-time recipients.\nSo what does 2025 hold for Woad?\nThe 'P' word is unavoidable, even if Woad will \"only be making that decision when I get to it\".\nTurning professional would appear to be the next logical step and Woad is on an LPGA pathway that could help accelerate that process.\n\"You can get an LPGA card when you reach 20 points and I'm currently on 16,\" she says. \"I'm trying to get 20 points this year and then we'll have a decision to make.\n\"If you make a cut in a major you get a point. If you get a top-25 finish you get a point. If you win Augusta or NCAAs (National Collegiate Athletic Associations), you get two points.\n\"I'm trying to not think too much about it. But if I play well I'm going to get those points.\"\nThe NCAAs are the pinnacle of collegiate golf in the US, pitting teams and individuals against each other. Woad finished runner-up in the individual competition last year, while her university team were joint 11th.\nThis season, Woad has posted an impressive eight consecutive top-three finishes since September. But her Florida State team-mate, 19-year-old Malaysian Mirabel Ting, has eclipsed that, winning six events since last year's AWNA to lead the NCAA individual rankings.\nJasmine Koo is also in a field which boasts 49 of the top 50 in the world. Over the past 12 months the number two ranked player has had four wins and seven top-five finishes.\nAnd 16-year-old Asterisk Talley is tipped to feature again. She finished joint eighth last year and went on to beat Woad in the singles at the Curtis Cup as she also enjoyed a superb 2024.\nHowever, Woad goes into the week knowing that she has conquered Augusta National before and she will again have England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson on the bag.\n\"That's going to be nice, to have that familiarity,\" she says. \"I'm just really excited. It's going to be a fun week, and hopefully I can be the first to defend the title.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Wednesday including a 10% tariff on most countries. \nSome of America's biggest trading partners will see even higher tariffs beginning 9 April. \nThe aggressive shift in trade policy makes clear where Trump stands on tariffs, but has left much of the world wondering what Americans - who are expected to see the side effects - think of the move. \nWe asked five people what they think. \nShe thinks the pain Americans will feel will be temporary and worth it. \nI know we're all going to get pinched in the pocket for a while. I think in the long run, it's going to get us out of the massive deficit that we're in. \nI am concerned about the price of goods going up. I am going to end up being more particular about what I buy, basically I'll tighten the belt for a while. \nBut then I think it's going to go full circle and it's going to be a good thing for the economy and for people in general. \nWe've been the world's financial doormat for a while and we've gotta stop it. \nThe soon-to-be-retiree worries about economic instability prompted by Trump's actions. \nI'm very unhappy. I'm probably a couple of years away from retiring and I don't know if I'm going to be able to retire. \nMy 401k's not doing great, Social Security is on the line and I don't think the tariffs are going to help America's standing on the world platform. \nTrump is not a king and I feel like our Congress and Senate is letting us down, both parties, by not pushing back [on tariffs].\nThey know better, and they're not doing anything. Why? \nThe trucker welcomes the incoming tariffs and hopes they can help restore smaller US towns.\nI feel like the way to kick-start investment back into US manufacturing is exactly this. \nIt's a necessary evil. \nUp until the 70s, there were two steel mills [in my area] and then they closed. And up until the last 10 years, the sites have been abandoned\nWe might not get back everything, but even if we recover 30-40% of it, it's quite a bit of money and jobs. \nGloria, who is retired, feels Trump administration officials don't appreciate how tariffs will affect her life.\nI'm on a fixed income. I'm retired, so things are going to go up and I'm worried. It means less money that I'll have coming in.\nWhat I'm trying to do is stock up on food because I think things are going to get really, really bad as far as shipping. Food is the one thing that you can't really cut from your budget. \nIf I can be honest, Trump's got all the money. He doesn't have to [worry about] food. Musk has all the things, so this isn't going to affect them. So they don't know about the pain. \nThey say 'a little pain', but how little is this pain?\nRobin says she's trying to hold out hope, but she worries the economic turmoil will affect her and her family.\nI'm worried. I'm worried about my retirement funds. I'm worried that he's going to make other countries hate us for what he's doing. I just think he's an idiot.\nI have a son and he's 30. He has his own family and he's looking for work and he's struggling. This isn't going to help things. He has two children - 18 months and six.\nI tend to be a glass half-full type of person, but the president and his ideas are just so crazy sometimes. My financial adviser, who I really trust, did say that some of Trump's plans are good and good for the finance market. \nIt gives me a little bit of hope, I guess. But then when you see the stock market plunging, it was like \"oh, maybe not\".",

        "article_text": "England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson will again caddie for Lottie Woad at the Augusta National Women's Amateur tournament\nIt was while standing on the 12th tee at Augusta National that Lottie Woad had one of those 'pinch me' moments.\nThe English amateur, from Farnham in Surrey, was seven holes away from securing a career highlight win that would kick-start a stellar 2024.\nIt was a year that started with her becoming the first European to claim the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) title at the home of the Masters - a title she will try to become the first to defend this week when the three-day competition starts on Wednesday.\nIt was a year in which the England Golf women's squad member played in her first majors, finished as top Briton at the Women's Open, helped win the Curtis Cup, and ended it as the world's number-one-ranked amateur.\n\"It was definitely a breakthrough year,\" the 21-year-old tells BBC Sport. \"Winning at Augusta was the highlight and that kicked off the whole year.\"\n\"I have respect for everyone playing the 12th hole because it looks bigger than it actually is, but there is not much room. It's probably like 20 feet deep max.\"\nAnd it was on the back nine at Augusta - where so many Masters dreams have flourished and floundered - that Woad managed to keep her nerve.\nThe 12th was among the pivotal holes and she had to steady herself to tackle one of the most daunting par-threes in golf.\nDozens of rounds have been ruined on this most picturesque of holes. Tiger Woods hit three balls in Rae's Creek, the water that protects the front of the green, on his way to a 10 in 2020, the year after he won his fifth Green Jacket.\n\"You're standing on the tee and you're just like, 'I'm on hole 12',\" she says.\n\"You're nervous but then you're also going 'I'm playing the 12th at Augusta', so it's not too bad.\"\nWoad, who went into the final round of the 54-hole event - of which the first 36 are played at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club - with a two-shot lead, marked a three on her card to stay at six under. \nBut up ahead American Bailey Shoemaker was putting the finishing touches to the first bogey-free round at Augusta in the five-year history of the ANWA. A sensational 66 set a target of seven under.\nA bogey on the par-five 13th meant Woad dropped two behind, but she produced a magical finish with three birdies in her final four holes to snatch victory on the final green.\nThe putt on the 18th was an 18-footer, downhill.\n\"It didn't have much break but it was pretty quick,\" she says.\n\"Then it went in and I've won at Augusta and everyone kind of went crazy.\"\nWoad's season was about to get a little more crazy. The victory opened the door to play the majors, the Chevron Championship two weeks later being the first.\nShe spent a hectic week catching up with friends and college work at Florida State University, where she is in the penultimate year of a sports management degree, before heading to Texas.\n\"My parents and coaches were at Augusta and they wanted to go home, so I was left on my own at my first major,\" she says.\n\"I had to get a local caddie, but I had a lot of confidence from Augusta, made the cut and was in contention.\" \nWoad finished joint 23rd, alongside England's Georgia Hall and Charley Hull, two of her \"favourite players\" that she had \"looked up to\" since concentrating on the sport from about the age of 13.\nShe had taken her first lessons, aged seven, with Farnham pro Luke Bone, who remains her coach.\nProgression to the England Girls followed by the age of 15 and, while perhaps not seen as the most naturally gifted golfer, Woad's work ethic impressed as she took advantage of resources not previously available to her.\n\"I had a putting coach, a strength and conditioning coach and a psychologist,\" she says.\n\"I was always pretty good at the long game, but I had to work a lot harder on my short game and I learned how to practise more effectively.\"\nShe went on to win the prestigious Girls Amateur Championship at Carnoustie in 2022, a decade after Hall triumphed in the event.\nWoad was back in Scotland for last year's Women's Open, which was held over the Old Course in St Andrews.\nShe had missed the cut at the US Women's Open and Evian Championship but arrived in Fife in buoyant mood for her fourth major.\nWoad would be in contention all week and finish joint 10th to win the Smyth Salver as the highest-placed amateur, with another highlight being a 60-yard chip-in eagle two on the par-four last in round three.\n\"That got me back into the top 10 going into final day. It was a really cool moment with the grandstand full of cheering people,\" she says.\n\"Then at the prize-giving I get to stand next to the winner, Lydia Ko. To see her lift that trophy motivates you.\n\"It was a perfect week. Home of golf, first Open - I couldn't have dreamed it better.\"\nThere was little time for celebration, though. The Curtis Cup, which pits Great Britain and Ireland's top female amateurs against their American counterparts, was the following week.\nThe Americans were favourites to win a fourth successive title after domineering victories in the previous three editions of the biennial event.\nBut GB&I were boosted by having Europe's victorious Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew as their leader.\nAnd Woad, who grew up 40 minutes from the Sunningdale Old Course that hosted the event, contributed 2\u00bd points in a nerve-shredding 10\u00bd-9\u00bd triumph.\nBy that point, Woad had ascended to top of the amateur rankings, which earned her the Mark H McCormack medal. Ko won the prize three successive times from its inception in 2011, while Ireland's Leona Maguire and rising US star Rose Zhang are also three-time recipients.\nSo what does 2025 hold for Woad?\nThe 'P' word is unavoidable, even if Woad will \"only be making that decision when I get to it\".\nTurning professional would appear to be the next logical step and Woad is on an LPGA pathway that could help accelerate that process.\n\"You can get an LPGA card when you reach 20 points and I'm currently on 16,\" she says. \"I'm trying to get 20 points this year and then we'll have a decision to make.\n\"If you make a cut in a major you get a point. If you get a top-25 finish you get a point. If you win Augusta or NCAAs (National Collegiate Athletic Associations), you get two points.\n\"I'm trying to not think too much about it. But if I play well I'm going to get those points.\"\nThe NCAAs are the pinnacle of collegiate golf in the US, pitting teams and individuals against each other. Woad finished runner-up in the individual competition last year, while her university team were joint 11th.\nThis season, Woad has posted an impressive eight consecutive top-three finishes since September. But her Florida State team-mate, 19-year-old Malaysian Mirabel Ting, has eclipsed that, winning six events since last year's AWNA to lead the NCAA individual rankings.\nJasmine Koo is also in a field which boasts 49 of the top 50 in the world. Over the past 12 months the number two ranked player has had four wins and seven top-five finishes.\nAnd 16-year-old Asterisk Talley is tipped to feature again. She finished joint eighth last year and went on to beat Woad in the singles at the Curtis Cup as she also enjoyed a superb 2024.\nHowever, Woad goes into the week knowing that she has conquered Augusta National before and she will again have England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson on the bag.\n\"That's going to be nice, to have that familiarity,\" she says. \"I'm just really excited. It's going to be a fun week, and hopefully I can be the first to defend the title.\"",

I want to make sure I get rid of it.\n\"Everytime we go there, it presents another chance to do so.\n\"I would be lying if I said I look forward to going there all the time because it is such a hard place to get results.

        "article_text": "Yoon Suk Yeol, who was officially removed from office on Friday, follows a line of former South Korean leaders who have had their reputations marred or terms interrupted by scandal. \nAmong them are presidents who have faced indictment, exile and imprisonment.\nYoon, who was South Korea's public prosecutor, in fact led a probe that landed former president Park Geun-hye in prison. \nNow apart from being impeached, Yoon is also being investigated for treason over his botched martial law attempt last December. Some analysts believe that, ironically, the move was driven by his fear of prosecution. \nHere is a list of former South Korean presidents whose political careers ended dramatically.\nBefore he became South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee spent some three decades as a pro-independence activist against Japanese rule. \nBut his presidency was polarising. \nWhile some respect him for having laid the foundations for a modern country after World War Two, critics condemn his authoritarian streak. Shortly after his inauguration in 1948, he implemented laws to curtail political dissent; he has also been blamed for the killing of civilians during the Korean War. \nThe opposition rejected Rhee's re-election in 1960 and accused him of rigging the vote. This escalated into violent student-led protests, which saw some demonstrators shot dead by police, and ultimately forced Rhee to resign. \nRhee left the country for Hawaii in May that year, where he died in 1965.\nBorn to a poor rural family in the early years of the Japanese occupation, Park Chung-hee joined the military and was posted to Manchuria (a historical region of north-eastern China) where he served until the Japanese surrendered.\nPark led a coup in 1961 to overthrow Rhee's successor, Chang Myon, and later became president. Park led the country for 18 years through a period of rapid economic development known as the \"miracle on the Han river\". It was during this time that the government opened doors to foreign investment, while also helping to develop now-famous conglomerates like Hyundai, LG and Samsung.\nHowever, he moved towards greater authoritarianism later in his term. In 1972, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and made himself \"president for life\". \nDespite Park's economic achievements, South Korea in the 1970s was rocked by growing protests against his iron-fisted rule, where dissenters were brutally punished.\nPark was assassinated at a dinner party in October 1979 by his own spy chief and lifelong friend Kim Jae-kyu. \nMilitary commander Chun Doo-hwan gained power in 1980 after yet another coup. He presided over a brutal military crackdown in the south-western city of Gwangju, which at the time was the centre of an uprising against martial law in South Korea. More than 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were either killed or disappeared.\nDuring Chun's term, the country saw growth rates hovering around 10% each year. However, he is mostly remembered as a dictator who was unapologetic till the end. \nIn 1983, Chun survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by North Korea forces, who bombed a ceremony he was at during a state visit to Myanmar. The attack killed 21 people and injured dozens more. \nIn 1988, Chun picked his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, also a former general, as his successor. \nThe pair were convicted in 1996 of corruption, as well as their roles in the coup and the Gwangju massacre. Defending the coup while on trial, Chun said he \"would take the same action, if the same situation arose\". \nChun was handed a death sentence - which was later commuted to life imprisonment - while Roh was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Both men were pardoned in 1997 after serving just two years in prison.\nBorn to a poor family, Roh Moo-hyun educated himself and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer without having attended law school. He was appointed a judge in 1977 but later left the bench to become a human rights lawyer, where he advocated for student activists accused of being pro-communist.\nIn 2002, Roh won the presidential election as an underdog, with early polls giving him just 2% of the vote. He tried to shape South Korea as a \"middle power\" among other stakeholders in the region, and championed a so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with trade and aid shipments. \nAfter leaving office in 2007, he returned to his hometown in the south-east and ran a duck farm. However, he took his own life 14 months later, as corruption investigators closed in over allegations he accepted $6m in bribes.\nPublic opinion on Roh improved considerably after his death. Polls by Gallup Korea have consistently ranked him the most beloved president in the country's history.\nFormer Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak entered politics in 1992 and was elected mayor of Seoul a decade later. He won the election by a landslide in 2007, even though a business scandal from his days at the automobile conglomerate resurfaced in the days leading up to the vote.\nLee led the country through the global financial crisis and won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. His term ended in 2013, and he was succeeded by the country's first female president Park Geun-hye, who is the daughter of assassinated former leader Park Chung-hee. \nThe younger Park drew on her father's reputation as the man who pulled South Korea out of poverty. However, a corruption scandal involving a confidante, Choi Soon-sil - the daughter of a Shamanistic cult leader - led to her impeachment in 2016 and arrest a year later.\nFive years after leaving office, Lee too was charged with bribery and later found guilty of creating slush funds of tens of millions of dollars, and taking bribes from various sources, including Samsung. \nPark was handed a 22-year sentence and Lee 15 years, but both have since been pardoned.

        "article_text": "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.\n\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".\nOn his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.\nHezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.\nHezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.\nIn the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"\nBut the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.\nI visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.\nYou can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here\nHezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets in around northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.\nThe pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.\nIn the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.\nAt the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.\nSouthern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.\nA 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".\nAccording to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.\nIran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.\nAlia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"\nIt is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.\nBut the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.\nUltimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.\nNasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.\n\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".\nAs part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.\nDiscussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.\nThe businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".\nFor weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.\nAdam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.\nProminent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

        "article_text": "Ask a group of film fans which role they will most remember actor Val Kilmer for, and each person will probably give you a different answer. \nHis performances in films like The Doors, Heat and Batman Forever are all likely to come up, while Willow and True Romance have their own dedicated fans. \nOne of his biggest films, Top Gun, is not only beloved by people old enough to have seen it when it was released in 1986, but also a much younger generation who are familiar with the much-memed scene of Kilmer's Iceman playing volleyball. \nHere are some of his most memorable roles from his wide-ranging stage and screen career. \nKilmer's first screen role was opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in an ABC Afterschool Special. He played her character's boyfriend, who drives drunk with devastating results.\nAnother of his earliest film roles was in 1985 comedy film Real Genius, in which he starred opposite Gabriel Jarret.\nKilmer's real career breakthrough came the following year, when he appeared in Top Gun, one of the biggest box office hits of the 1980s.\nKilmer played Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, the arrogant rival to Tom Cruise's Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell.\nTwo years later, Kilmer starred as a mercenary swordsman in Willow, the fantasy adventure directed by Ron Howard.\nKilmer and Joanne Whalley starred together in films including Willow and Twixt, and in 1989 they played a couple who rob a pair of Las Vegas mobsters in Kill Me Again. They got married in 1988.\nKilmer channelled the spirit of singer Jim Morrison in director Oliver Stone's 1991 biopic of US rock band The Doors.\nIn 1993's True Romance, Kilmer played a version of Elvis Presley who is a figment of Christian Slater's imagination. The film was written by Quentin Tarantino and saw Kilmer reunited with Top Gun director Tony Scott.\nIn 1995, Kilmer delivered a memorable and chilling performance in Michael Mann's Heat, as the right-hand man of a criminal played by Robert De Niro.\nIn the same year, Kilner played one of his most defining roles as Bruce Wayne, the titular superhero in Batman Forever, opposite Nicole Kidman.\nIn 1997, Kilmer appeared in The Saint as a high-tech thief and master of disguise who uses the moniker of various saints.\nNot all of Kilmer's films were box office hits, however. The Island Of Dr Moreau, released in 1996, was a critical and comercial flop.\nRed Planet, which was set on Mars, earned $33m on a budget of $80m in 2000.\nIn 2004, Kilmer played King Philip in Alexander, which co-starred Colin Farrell as Alexander the Great.\nKilmer's stage roles included a 2005 stint in London's West End in The Postman Always Rings Twice at the Playhouse Theatre.\nLater that year, he appeared with Robert Downey Jr (right) and Michelle Monoghan (centre) in the crime comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\nIn 2006, he appeared  in CBS mini-series Comanche Moon, pictured with Troy Baker as Pea Eye Parker (left) and Keith Robinson as Joshua Deets (right).\nKilmer again reunited with Top Gun director Tony Scott for hit 2006 action sci-fi film Deja Vu, also starring Denzel Washington (left) and Adam Goldberg (right).\nKilmer starred in two films opposite rapper 50 Cent - 2009's Streets of Blood and 2010's Gun, both of which were released directly to video and DVD.\nKilmer was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for best spoken word album, for voicing Zorro in an audio drama adaptation of The Mark of Zorro.\nKilmer played writer Mark Twain in a one-man stage show called Citizen Twain in California in 2012.\nLater that year, Kilmer filmed scenes for Terrence Malick's film Song To Song at a Texas music festival. The film was released five years later, in 2017.\nIn 2013, Kilmer appeared as himself in Life's Too Short, the comedy series created by Warwick Davis, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Kilmer and Davis had previously appeared together in Willow.\nKilmer was pictured with Al Pacino at a live reading of Shakespeare's Live Read of The Merchant Of Venice in 2019, more than two decades after starring together in Heat.\nOff screen, Kilmer dated a number of high-profile women over the years, including Cher, Angelina Jolie, Daryl Hannah and Cindy Crawford.\nKilmer launched his movie Twixt at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011.",

Pinpointed two months ago by 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy - who advises the owner - as the pick of JP McManus' stellar squad. Would be the first horse carrying top weight to triumph since the legendary Red Rum in the 1970s.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Venetia Williams Jockey: Charlie Deutsch\nForm: F-1P66 Age: 11 Weight:11-9\nThrives in different conditions, at Haydock in the mud \u2013 scene of five of his seven career victories, including back-to-back runnings of the Betfair Chase. Past three runs have been disappointing. Owned by flamboyant former banker Rich Ricci, you might not get rich backing this one although trainer did triumph with 100-1 outsider Mon Mome in 2009.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 125-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Patrick Mullins\nForm: 73-411 Age: 8 Weight: 11-8\nOwner Stewart Andrew clearly thinks he's a rocket - he eyed Cheltenham Gold Cup, but trainer preferred to go for the National. Would be an emotional winner as Andrew's wife Sadie died in December 2022, five days after watching Nick Rockett in his first race. A winner of the Thyestes Chase then Bobbyjo Chase, where Intense Raffles was runner-up, but that rival better off at the weights here. Jockey rides for trainer father.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian Hayes\nForm: 1-P625 Age: 9 Weight: 11-8\nWould be a poignant winner as the last horse bought for owners Cheveley Park Stud by joint boss David Thompson at the end of 2020, just 19 days before his death. Runner-up in Irish Gold Cup to Galopin Des Champs at 66-1 when finishing ahead of subsequent Cheltenham winners Fact To File and Inothewayurthinkin. Drying ground should suit.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: John Joseph Hanlon (IRE) Jockey: Gavin Sheehan\nForm: 232571 Age: 10 Weight: 11-7\nAn \u00a3800 bargain buy who has won big races including the King George VI Chase, Bet365 Gold Cup, Galway Plate and American Grand National. Trainer, nicknamed 'Shark', has taken horse into local pub to celebrate victories, and believes he could be sent off favourite. Well backed in lead-up to race, would be suited by dry spell with good going right up his street.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael Blackmore\nForm: 443-26 Age: 12 Weight: 11-3\nLooked a potential winner last year in closing stages before finishing third. Triumphed in 2021 Cheltenham Gold Cup for trainer, who won National a month later with stablemate Minella Times as Rachael Blackmore became first female jockey to win the race. Could easily be prominent again for her although would be some effort to become only third horse to complete Gold Cup-National double.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O'Keeffe\nForm: 2-5351 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nShowed bundles of promise when winning the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival four years ago but much of that has been unfulfilled. Won for the first time in two years last time out at Thurles. Not the most obvious victor in trainer's talented team and no guarantee at all that he will appreciate this marathon distance.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Jonathan Burke\nForm: 0-8P43 Age: 9 Weight: 11-2\nWhile powerful trainer has other hopefuls, including last year's winner, don't let this one go under the radar. Third under top weight to Intense Raffles in last year's Irish Grand National before winning Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown. Breeding and form point to potential for big run. Minella horses take their name from a Tipperary family hotel run by racehorse trader John Nallen.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jordan Gainford\nForm:  U58708 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nBoasts some decent form including Irish Gold Cup win, when Minella Indo was second, albeit that was three years ago. Has run well at this meeting before, including a good second to Jonbon over shorter distance last year. Trainer seeking fourth victory in race, but suspicion is age, weight and longer trip may be against this one.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Keith Donoghue\nForm: -U1111 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nSecured fourth straight victory of the season by winning Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham Festival in fine style last month. That is the same race Tiger Roll won before his 2018 and 2019 National triumphs. Stumptown's trainer went to town at Cheltenham by landing the Gold Cup with Inothewayurthinkin, who was then made hot favourite for this but skips the race.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 8-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Freddie Gingell\nForm: 83-222 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nPart-owned by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Hitman has been a bit hit and miss. Has a habit of coming second - finishing runner-up in 11 of his 26 races - and this distance is a real unknown. Talented 19-year-old jockey credits much of his success to his mother Kim who died in 2020 from cancer aged 43.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies\nForm: 1P-132 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nJockey rides for trainer father, who has landed the race twice before. Winner of Midlands Grand National last year. Owner Bryan Burrough hoping for second success, 42 years after his colours were carried to victory by the Jenny Pitman-trained Corbiere. It's a tough ask but had a convincing victory over fences at Ascot earlier in season and stamina looks assured.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: James Reveley\nForm: 6-2383  Age: 10 Weight: 11-0\nForm has dipped since reaching top of his game two or three years ago. Won jump racing's festive showpiece, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, in 2022 and was second a year later. In between, finished runner-up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Will take a brave man or woman to pick this one after an 11-race losing run. Stable jockey rides Kandoo Kid.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: James Bowen\nForm: 9-5515  Age: 11 Weight: 10-13\nBit of an enigma. Was on a 10-race losing run when won well at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Maybe he was just in the party mood. Green and gold colours of owner JP McManus look more likely to succeed elsewhere, although there is a breeding positive - Chantry House's sire Yeats was also dad to 2022 National winner Noble Yeats.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Skelton\nForm: 210-32 Age: 10 Weight: 10-12\nNamed after owner Max McNeill's late father and ex-professional golfer Ted, who was three under par through five holes to lead The Open at Royal Portrush in 1951. Will the gelding be above or below par? Fourth in the Scottish National two years ago but well behind Minella Cocooner and Nick Rockett in last season's Bet365 Gold Cup.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Mark Walsh\nForm: 286411  Age: 8 Weight: 10-12\nAnother powerful weapon in the armoury of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer, who also has Stumptown and Vanillier. A beaten favourite for both the Galway Plate and Kerry National but form of his Leopardstown win in December reads well and now takes a big step up in trip. Named after a 1970s film about a 12th Century knight, could he put his rivals to the sword here?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 12-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Cobden\nForm: P23-18 Age: 9 Weight: 10-11\nDecent third in Topham Chase over National fences last year. Won Coral Gold Cup, formerly the Hennessy, at Newbury in November. Only one horse, Many Clouds, has gone on to also win the National, though trainer thinks he can do it. He won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges and says the grey Kandoo Kid is the \"ideal horse for the race\".\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1\nTrainer: Oliver Greenall & Josh Guerriero Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr\nForm: 2-2F42  Age: 7 Weight: 10-11\nA Cheltenham Festival winner in 2023. Second at Aintree meeting 12 months ago to subsequent Gold Cup winner Inowthewayurthinkin when nominated by owner JP McManus as his 'National horse for next year'. Joint-trainer Oliver Greenall's father Lord Daresbury is former racecourse chairman who has an Aintree stand named after him. Co-trainer Josh Guerriero won Foxhunters' Chase over National fences as amateur jockey in 2008.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 9-1\nTrainer: Tom Gibney (IRE) Jockey: JJ Slevin\nForm: 11-902 Age: 7 Weight: 10-10\nSounds like a deadly serious lottery, and has a deadly serious chance. Winner of the Irish Grand National last year. Nearly all of his races have been on soft or heavy ground. The grey runs in the 'double green' colours of owner-breeders Simon Munir and Isaac Souede. Showed his wellbeing when second, despite carrying more weight, to Nick Rockett at Fairyhouse in February.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O'Keeffe\nForm: 1P-169 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10\nPulled up in last year's Irish National but marked himself out as a candidate for this race when winning well at Cheltenham in October. Subsequently sixth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury when he was staying on, which could be a good sign for the test ahead. Owned by the Lucky In Life Syndicate. Will the horse live up to their name?\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Richard Phillips Jockey: Harry Bannister\nForm: F03106 Age: 11 Weight: 10-10\nPreviously based in Ireland, where he won the Midlands National last summer at Kilbeggan. Having second run for amiable Gloucestershire trainer, who does a nice line in impressions. He helped buy the horse with John Rosbotham, a friend of 55 years with whom he dreamed in the school playground of having a National runner, and it runs for a syndicate of 12 called the Dozen Dreamers.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey:  Sam Ewing\nForm: 212433 Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nFive of his six wins have come at roughly half the distance of this race. Looks an uphill task on the face of it, but interestingly mentioned as a potential surprise package by the trainer \u2013 who has won three times previously - when weights for the race were announced in February. Would probably benefit from soft ground.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Tom Bellamy\nForm: 5-324P Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nOwner David Proos hoping to go two better after his family silks were carried to third by Rinus in 1990. No forlorn hope based on his second to Kandoo Kid in Coral Gold Cup at Newbury. One for alliteration fans - could Broadway Boy follow Mon Mome, Party Politics and Red Rum as a nifty-sounding National winner for trainer, who has triumphed twice before?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarvey\nForm: U50029 Age: 10 Weight: 10-9\nEleventh in last year's race, when hampered late on, having previously finished eighth and pulled up. Prominent on each occasion before fading. Winner of the Troytown Chase in 2023. Will probably be spotted towards the front again but takes a leap of faith to see him stay there and become only the fourth grey horse to win the National.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Paul O'Brien\nForm: 3PP-P0 Age: 8 Weight: 10-9\nLooked to be heading for big things after winning Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023 but career over the bigger obstacles has not been straightforward and pulled up on three of his past four runs. Jockey called up for first ride in race after original bookings Bryony Frost (riding in France) then Johnny Burke (on Minella Cocooner instead) were unavailable\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny Mullins\nForm: 37-008 Age: 8 Weight: 10-7\n'Caught the eye' of last year's winning trainer when the weights were revealed in February. Finished seventh in 2024 when appeared to run out of steam. That could be perceived as a stamina doubt, although might see out the trip better now a year stronger and stable's Hedgehunter won in 2005 after a tired late fall the previous year.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Jonjo & AJ O'Neill Jockey: Nick Scholfield\nForm: 5P-241 Age: 9 Weight: 10-9\nIntriguing contender who finished fourth in the Welsh Grand National before ending a two-year losing run with victory at Uttoxeter. Finished third to subsequent National winner Corach Rambler at Cheltenham Festival two years ago. Formerly owned by Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman before being sold last year to Martin Tedham, who sponsors the trainer's yard.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Sean Flanagan\nForm: -P6913 Age: 10 Weight: 10-6\nThis was my selection in 2023, when he ended up finishing second to Corach Rambler for shrewd trainer. Was 14th last year on softer ground but comfortable Punchestown win in February showcased his credentials. Nearly took the wrong route at Cheltenham last month before recovering to finish third in Cross Country Chase. Chance again if the satnav is working.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Michael Keady Jockey: Ciaran Gethings\nForm:  F22999  Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nRunner-up in the Kerry and Munster Nationals when trained by Willie Mullins but switched stables last month. Now based in the Flat racing capital of Newmarket. Trainer set up on his own five months ago and is looking for first win over jumps in biggest steeplechase of all. Has to be a doubt over whether this contender possesses the same ability and stamina as some of his rivals.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: Nico de Boinville\nForm: 141122 Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nNovice chaser looking to break duck for trainer, who is one of the greats but has poor record in this race \u2013 with no win from 43 previous runners. Sound jumper who should like the ground. Need an omen? One of the owners, Paul Humphreys, was born on same day as Grand National legend Red Rum. Their syndicate once included the late John Sillett, Coventry City's FA Cup-winning manager.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Philip Hobbs and Johnson White Jockey: Micheal Nolan\nForm: 45U4-1 Age: 13 Weight: 10-6\nThe obstacles should not be an issue, having finished eighth and fourth in the past two runnings of the shorter Topham Chase over the National fences. However, this is a longer and stiffer task. No 13-year-old horse has won the National since Sergeant Murphy 102 years ago and hard to see an equine teenager being celebrated this time around.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Sean Bowen\nForm: -33713  Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nThis race has been the long-term plan, says the trainer, who has been successful three times before. And he has been dealt a nice hand with the horse sneaking in towards the bottom of the weights. Rider is actually allergic to horses, but is on the verge of becoming British champion jockey and steps in for injured Jack Kennedy.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Ben Pauling Jockey:  Beau Morgan\nForm: 5-2P77 Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nA family affair as 20-year-old jockey rides horse owned by his mother Georgia. The expected sunny conditions should suit as six of his seven wins have come on good ground. Second in the Ultima Chase at last year's Cheltenham Festival, he ran three times over hurdles this season before finishing a distant seventh in the Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 80-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Danny Gilligan\nForm: 352P4B Age: 8 Weight: 10-4\nUnlikely to need a Duffle Coat on Merseyside this weekend with sunny spells forecast and temperatures expected to reach 18C. Unlikely too that this grey will prove good enough to triumph despite low weight. Runner-up in last summer's Galway Plate and has finished second several times but only managed to wrap up one win from his past 27 races.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nLatest horse racing results",

        "article_text": "It's business time in Fantasy Premier League, with double and blank gameweeks ahead.\nThere are only eight weeks left so transfers are precious, every week matters that little bit more and you don't want to leave anything on the table.\nAs a reminder...\nGameweek 31 - normal gameweek\nGameweek 32 - double gameweek for Newcastle and Crystal Palace\nGameweek 33 - double gameweek for Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal Palace\nGameweek 34 - blank gameweek for Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal Palace\nIf you're stuck for how to approach this period then don't worry, help is at hand.\nFPL expert Gianni Buttice will be joining us on the BBC Sport website at 14:30 BST on Friday 4 April for a live question and answer session.\nWant him to grade your wildcard? Need a differential for the rest of the season? Confused about chip strategy?\nGet your questions in for Gianni on X using #bbcfootball.\nIn the meantime, here's our week 31 team of the week for some short-term inspiration.\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\nManchester City held the team together with captain Omar Marmoush (18 points) and clean sheets for Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.\nAside from that it was a lot of one and two-pointers for 43 points. Meh.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nIf Kieran Trippier can reproduce his form of the past two seasons, he is a great differential defensive pick\nEmi Martinez, Aston Villa, keeper, \u00a35m - Nottingham Forest (h)\nThe Argentine kept just his fourth clean sheet of the season in Wednesday's win at Brighton but he is a differential keeper option for this week and the rest of the season.\nVilla face goal-shy Southampton next week before a double in 33.\nForest are not an easy opponent for Villa but they are definitely not as threatening without injured striker Chris Wood.\nVirgil van Dijk, Liverpool, \u00a36.5m - Fulham (a)\nLiverpool's defence is rolling at the moment, with three clean sheets in their past four including keeping Manchester City and Newcastle out.\nAnd Van Dijk has only scored once so far this season. He has not finished a season with just one goal since 2020-21, so the law of averages means he is due.\nDjed Spence, Spurs, \u00a34.4m - Southampton (h)\nWhile Tottenham's form is nose-diving again, they face a Saints side with just 22 goals in 30 games - the league's lowest total.\nSpence seems to be holding down that right-back spot and, if they do keep a clean sheet, has a great chance of bonus.\nIn Tottenham's recent back-to-back clean sheets, against Brentford and Manchester United, Spence earned the maximum three bonus points.\nKieran Trippier, Newcastle, \u00a35.6m - Leicester (a)\nAm I getting suckered in with memories of prime Trippier from the past two seasons, when he had nine and 10 assists? Possibly.\nIs picking a defender against Leicester each week the most obvious call? Yes.\nThat makes Trippier worth a punt in my opinion, even if he is nursing a potential groin issue.\nHe took three set-pieces, made three crosses and two key passes in Wednesday's win over Brentford, so you're getting a defender who is pretty involved in attacking play.\nDouble up on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli?\nMohamed Salah (vice-captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Fulham (a)\nSalah has failed to score in two of his past three games and his expected goal involvement (xGI) of 0.17 against Everton on Wednesday was the Egyptian's lowest all season.\nBut this man has 44 goal involvements in 2024-25 so don't give up on him yet!\nThere could come a time - especially if you are chasing your rivals - where going without Salah makes sense in a few weeks, as Liverpool won't have a double gameweek this season.\nBut not yet.\nJacob Murphy, Newcastle, \u00a35m - Leicester (a)\nFPL players may be looking at Anthony Gordon as the best Newcastle midfield option, with a double gameweek next week for the Magpies.\nBut Murphy, at just \u00a35m, can easily match Gordon.\nHe has nine assists now this season and has started every game since week 14. Bargain.\nBukayo Saka, Arsenal, \u00a310.3m - Everton (a)\nSaka has gone from 'player to watch' to essential in this column in the space of three weeks.\nYour only worry is whether, with a Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid coming up, the England man is rested for the odd game having just come back from injury.\nBut a start against Everton seems certain and Saka is still second on the assists chart with 11 this season, despite missing just over three months.\nGabriel Martinelli, Arsenal, \u00a36.5m - Everton (a)\nSaka's return is good for team-mate Martinelli, even though a trip to Everton isn't exactly easy on paper.\nThe pair had a combined 52 goals and assists two seasons ago, getting on the end of each other's crosses, and with a double gameweek in 33 of Palace (h) and Ipswich (a), why not double up on the Arsenal attack?\nAlexander Isak (captain), Newcastle, \u00a39.5m - Leicester (a)\nThe 20-goal striker is a slight injury doubt but you have to go with him against this Championship-bound Leicester side.\nCaptaining Manchester City's Marmoush against Leicester paid off last week so we go again!\nLiam Delap, Ipswich, \u00a35.6m - Wolves (h)\nThis is a must-win game for Ipswich and we're at the stage of the season where form goes out of the window a little.\nPortman Road will be pumped up and if Town do pull off a victory, chances are Delap will be involved in some way.\nThe 11-goal striker has been involved in 43% of Ipswich's goals this season, a statistic bettered only by four strikers who have played more than 10 games - Isak, Erling Haaland, Wolves' Matheus Cunha (who is suspended for this one) and Jamie Vardy.\nDominic Solanke, Spurs, \u00a37.3m - Southampton (h)\nThis is a pure gut-feel pick (you need one in every team right?) as Solanke has no form to speak of. He had an expected goals (xG) of zero in Thursday's defeat at Chelsea.\nBut the England striker was just getting motoring before an injury after gameweek 21 put him out for six matches.

domestic success over their continental ambitions this season.\nThe three-time Champions Cup winners have decided to rest several of their England internationals, including Maro Itoje and Tom Willis, for their trip to Toulon.\nDirector of rugby Mark McCall says he is prioritising making the Premiership play-offs over the chance at a fourth European crown.\nNorthampton Saints, meanwhile, are the only English side with a home tie after finishing top of Pool 3.\nSaints are eighth in the Premiership table after enduring a dismal defence of their title, but Phil Dowson's side will host Clermont in a welcome reprieve from their domestic campaign. \nThe visitors are sixth in France's Top 14 table after their recent victory over La Rochelle ended a run of five consecutive league defeats.\nClermont booked their place in the knockout stages by snatching a dramatic 33-26 victory in the sixth minute of overtime to qualify at Bath and Bristol's expense.\nElsewhere, Sale Sharks face a daunting trip to six-time winners and defending champions Toulouse, who will be without injured talisman Antoine Dupont after he ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee during France's Six Nations win over Ireland last month.\nHarlequins face an equally difficult task at four-time winners Leinster, while Leicester Tigers travel north to take on Glasgow Warriors.\nAll three Irish provinces which started in this season's competition have reached the knockout stages.\nLeinster lead the United Rugby Championship (URC) and will be targeting a fifth star on the jersey after finishing top of Pool 2 with a clean sweep of four comfortable wins.\nFly-half Sam Prendergast has stepped into retired colossus Johnny Sexton's shoes for club and country seamlessly, while the bulk of Ireland's first-choice pack, including Josh van der Flier and Caelan Doris, ply their trade in Dublin.\nMunster finished third in Pool 3 to qualify for the last 16 and they will reunited with their former fly-half Ronan O'Gara in the next round.\nThey will travel to the Stade Marcel-Deflandre to face the 2022 and 2023 champions La Rochelle, who are coached by O'Gara.\nIreland legends Peter O'Mahony and Conor Murray have retired from the international stage and will want to end their long-standing Munster careers this summer with silverware.\nUlster, meanwhile, won just one of their four Pool 1 games and scraped through to the knockout stages on points difference.\nThey will face an away trip to title contenders Bordeaux-Begles, who finished top of Pool 1 after four bonus-point wins, including a 40-19 victory when the two sides last met in December. \nDefending URC champions Glasgow are flying the Scottish flag in the last 16 after finishing second in Pool 4.\nWarriors, who are also currently second in the URC, will welcome Tigers to Scotstoun in fine form after pummelling Johannesburg Lions 42-0 in their most recent outing.\nGeorge Horne became the club's record try-scorer in their victory over the South African side, while Leicester were narrowly beaten by Saracens in their last Premiership match.\nTigers are third in the English top-flight and outgoing head coach Michael Chieka says he will work harder to achieve success domestically and in Europe before leaving the club this summer. \nBenetton, meanwhile, will make their last-16 debut after a surprise 32-25 victory over two-time champions La Rochelle in their final Pool 2 game.\nThe Italian side boast a large contingent of the  Italy national team, including their fearsome centre partnership of Juan Ignacio Brex and Tommaso Menoncello.\nLike Italy, Benetton play a free-flowing brand of rugby and will pose a threat in their trip to French side Castres.\nSix of this season's last 16 hail from France. \nBordeaux-Begles made light work of the pool stages and in France wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey, who last month broke the record for the most tries scored in a Six Nations campaign, boast one of the deadliest finishers in world rugby.\nDespite the loss of Dupont, Top 14 leaders Toulouse are also among the favourites to secure a record seventh European crown.\nThree-time winners Toulon finished top of Pool 4 despite a heavy defeat by Sale Sharks and will be favourites to overcome an under-strength Saracens side.\nLa Rochelle, meanwhile, are without a win in eight matches since they beat Toulouse in January.\nO'Gara has previously led his side to back-to-back Champions Cup titles but he will have to stop this year's rot if he wishes to overcome his former side Munster.\nPool 3 runners-up Castres and Clermont Auvergne make up the French sextet.\nIt could be another final between the tournament's two most successful sides on 24 May at Principality Stadium as Toulouse and Leinster both ended up on opposite sides of the draw.\nNorthampton will play a home quarter-final if they can navigate their way past Clermont, while a potential semi-final rematch from last year's competition could await against Leinster.\nHowever, a victory for Quins over Leinster and a Leicester win in Glasgow would also set-up an all-Premiership tie in the next round.\nQuarter-final draw (ties to be played on the weekend 11/12/13 April):\nBordeaux-Begles/Ulster v La Rochelle/Munster\nToulon/Saracens v Toulouse/Sale Sharks\nLeinster/Harlequins v Glasgow Warriors/Leicester

Scottish and Italian representationDefending URC champions Glasgow are flying the Scottish flag in the last 16 after finishing second in Pool 4.Warriors, who are also currently second in the URC, will welcome Tigers to Scotstoun in fine form after pummelling Johannesburg Lions 42-0 in their most recent outing.George Horne became the club's record try-scorer in their victory over the South African side, while Leicester were narrowly beaten by Saracens in their last Premiership match.Tigers are third in the English top-flight and outgoing head coach Michael Chieka says he will work harder to achieve success domestically and in Europe before leaving the club this summer. Benetton, meanwhile, will make their last-16 debut after a surprise 32-25 victory over two-time champions La Rochelle in their final Pool 2 game.The Italian side boast a large contingent of the  Italy national team, including their fearsome centre partnership of Juan Ignacio Brex and Tommaso Menoncello.Like Italy, Benetton play a free-flowing brand of rugby and will pose a threat in their trip to French side Castres.French dominanceSix of this season's last 16 hail from France. Bordeaux-Begles made light work of the pool stages and in France wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey, who last month broke the record for the most tries scored in a Six Nations campaign, boast one of the deadliest finishers in world rugby.Despite the loss of Dupont, Top 14 leaders Toulouse are also among the favourites to secure a record seventh European crown.Three-time winners Toulon finished top of Pool 4 despite a heavy defeat by Sale Sharks and will be favourites to overcome an under-strength Saracens side.La Rochelle, meanwhile, are without a win in eight matches since they beat Toulouse in January.O'Gara has previously led his side to back-to-back Champions Cup titles but he will have to stop this year's rot if he wishes to overcome his former side Munster.Pool 3 runners-up Castres and Clermont Auvergne make up the French sextet.What's up next?It could be another final between the tournament's two most successful sides on 24 May at Principality Stadium as Toulouse and Leinster both ended up on opposite sides of the draw.Northampton will play a home quarter-final if they can navigate their way past Clermont, while a potential semi-final rematch from last year's competition could await against Leinster.However, a victory for Quins over Leinster and a Leicester win in Glasgow would also set-up an all-Premiership tie in the next round.Quarter-final draw (ties to be played on the weekend 11/12/13 April):Bordeaux-Begles/Ulster v La Rochelle/MunsterToulon/Saracens v Toulouse/Sale SharksLeinster/Harlequins v Glasgow Warriors/Leicester TigersNorthampton Saints/Clermont Auvergne v Castres or BenettonSemi-final draw (ties to be played on the weekend 2/3/4 May):Bordeaux/Ulster/La Rochelle/Munster v Toulon/Saracens/Toulouse/SaleLeinster/Harlequins/Glasgow/Leicester Tigers v Northampton/Clermont/Castres/BenettonRelated topicsMunsterGlasgow WarriorsSaleUlsterNorthampton SaintsLeinsterSaracensRugby UnionLeicester TigersHarlequins",

        "article_text": "Jonny Bairstow and James Anderson will not face off this season after Yorkshire were promoted and Lancashire relegated\nThe 2025 County Championship begins on Friday - and, remarkably for early April, the weather is set to be glorious.\nBut which county sides will sparkle this season and whose outlook is gloomy?\nThe BBC's local radio county cricket commentators and online journalists - who will be providing ball-by-ball radio and live text commentary throughout the season on the BBC Sport website and app - take a look at each club's prospects... \nCounty Championship preview: Who can stop Surrey?\nJennings 'job' is to win Lancashire silverware\nBears must spread wickets around - Hannon-Dalby\n2024 season - Eighth in Division Two\nDave Fletcher - BBC Radio Derby\nGiven Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two in 2024, things can surely only improve. \nThey did at least win a game last year, unlike 2023, but it was another bitterly disappointing watch for the County Ground faithful.\nThey were not helped by an opening round washout against Gloucestershire last season which meant they were playing catch-up from the off.\nThat appears unlikely to be repeated so a quick start \u2013 against the same opposition - is essential.\nThey have added Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell to the squad and he will be joined by returning Kiwi quick bowler Blair Tickner, whose spell last season was all too brief.\nThere's a new captain at the helm, too, although it is a familiar figure. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad.

        "summary": "A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.They've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.With Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.But if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.Lancashire - 'Red Rose favourites for promotion'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Rocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)Scott Read - BBC Radio LancashireSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. Last season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.Tall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.There is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.Middlesex - 'Williamson signing a coup'2024 season - Third in Division TwoKevin Hand - BBC Radio LondonThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).The rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.With the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.The mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.In the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. It is a good recipe to have.Sussex - 'Experienced players will be crucial'2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)Adrian Harms - BBC Radio SussexThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.During that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.Farbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.However, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.But don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.Provided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.Sussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.Warwickshire - 'Bears have no shortage of talent'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season2024 season - Seventh in Division OneMike Taylor - BBC Radio WMA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.Tickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.Already in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.Winter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.The big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.Durham - 'Bowling the key issue'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Matthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups2024 season - Fifth in Division OneMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio NewcastleDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. It was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.The former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.The signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.Northamptonshire - 'Lehmann arrival brings positivity'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Darren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 20182024 season - Fourth in Division TwoAndrew Radd - BBC Radio NorthamptonshireThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.After being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.With opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine.",

        "article_text": "Being Maria, a new film starring Matt Dillon and Anamaria Vartolomei, explores the life of Maria Schneider and the making of one of the most notorious films in cinema history.\nIt may be the most infamous scene in the entire history of cinema. The sexually explicit drama Last Tango in Paris, made by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1972, is the story of an affair between a middle-aged man, Paul, and a young woman, Jeanne, in a Paris apartment. The notorious \"butter scene\" was not in the original script and elements of it were made without 19-year-old actress Maria Schneider's prior consent.\nWarning: This article contains themes of sexual assault that some may find upsetting.\u00a0\nSchneider struggled with drug addiction and her mental health for years after the film's release, but her story, and the making of Last Tango in Paris, is now being told through the film Being Maria. It stars Matt Dillon as Marlon Brando, who played Paul, and Anamaria Vartolomei as Schneider. The film's French director Jessica Palud adapted the story from a 2018 memoir by journalist Vanessa Schneider, Maria's cousin.\n\"I think we have to look at the context of the time of Last Tango in Paris, it's now fifty years since the film was made,\" Matt Dillon tells the BBC. \"That time was a different time, but it's very important to look at it now from a different perspective.\n\"It was really a traumatic experience for her. And not just at the time it happened, but as it continued to follow her and haunt her wherever she went in her life, in so many ways.\"\nBeing Maria explores Schneider's background: she was the product of an affair between a famous French actor, Daniel G\u00e9lin, and a Romanian model. She first met her father as a teenager, and he introduced her to film sets. Last Tango in Paris was her first leading role, and she would later recall in a 2007 interview, then in her fifties, that she was persuaded to take the part instead of starring in a film with French film star Alain Delon, and, at the age of 19, \"didn't understand all of the film's sexual content\". She \"had a bad feeling about it all\", she said, but was told by her agency she couldn't possibly turn down working with Marlon Brando, one of the greatest stars of 20th-Century cinema.\nShe remembered what happened on the day of filming that scene, in which her character is raped by Brando's, using butter as a lubricant. \"That scene wasn't in the original script. The truth is it was Marlon who came up with the idea. They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry\u2026 I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologise,\" she said. \"Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie,' but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears.\n\"Thankfully, there was just one take.\"\nBertolucci would later talk about why he withheld details of the scene from Schneider, saying: \"I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress. I wanted her to react humiliated.\" He insisted that it was only the use of the butter that had surprised the actress, but Matt Dillon says what happened was \"really wrong\".\n\"It's something that we often do, actors, we won't tell the other actor, or the director will encourage us to not reveal what we're going to do, so we can get a real reaction,\" he says. \"But it was really wrong, with a scene that was so sensitive, to do something like that.\"\u00a0\nJessica Palud tells the BBC that recreating the rape scene \"couldn't be avoided\" in Being Maria, but this time, the audience sees events from Maria Schneider's perspective. \"I couldn't avoid shooting this scene because it was the very moment in which her life completely switches. Everything goes wrong from there,\" Palud says. \"It was important to have the scene from her point of view, in her body, in her gaze, what she went through, and the fact that there were witnesses. Maria was being assaulted in the presence of the whole crew, who were observing and not reacting.\"\nThis time the scene was prepared using an intimacy co-ordinator, which 61-year-old Dillon says was his first time working with one. \"I said to the intimacy co-ordinator, 'do you know what the scene is about?'\" he recalls. \"They said yes, and I said, 'Because you can probably trace back the role of an intimacy co-ordinator to that moment, in that film.'\"\u00a0\nThe use of an intimacy co-ordinator, who acts as a choreographer and a liaison between actors and production during simulated sex and nude scenes, is increasingly standard in the industry since the #MeToo movement. It now makes headlines when they're declined, including by Mikey Madison in Oscar winner Anora, or when Gwyneth Paltrow revealed that she told one to \"step a little bit back\" during her sex scenes with Timoth\u00e9e\u00a0Chalamet in Marty Supreme.\n\"I don't think it's a bad thing, I think it can evolve into being something good,\" Dillon says of using intimacy co-ordinators. \"It seems they're there to prevent people from crossing boundaries, but in fact it's creating boundaries that give opportunities for different ways of approaching these scenes. I hope that's how it evolves rather than people feeling like 'they're here to tell us what we can and can't do.' And Anamaria and I were very comfortable.\"\nAnamaria Vartolomei (who also made Golden Lion winner Happening, featuring scenes of illegal abortion) says that although she felt \"safe, protected and guided\" shooting the rape scene on the Being Maria shoot, she still became upset. \"This scene was really violent,\" she tells the BBC. \"I couldn't imagine what it was for Maria as she felt it for real. I'm just playing her. But this thing really happened to her, and she had no one around her. She just had people looking at her without doing anything. I think the violence of it was double because she didn't have the support I had on set, but I still felt it was really hard.\u00a0\n\"I was so emotional that day. I couldn't stop crying because I feel I accumulated the violence of the scene when I saw it on screen. When I had to play it, all my tears came out. I think it's very brutal. And it's insane to think that somebody could do this.\"\u00a0\nMaria Schneider was not only professionally unsupported on set, but she also lacked the experience to know that Bertolucci couldn't make her to do the scene. \"I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that,\" she would say later.\u00a0\nBut it was also the sensation the film Last Tango in Paris caused when it was shown from October 1972 that would undo Schneider. Despite (or helped by) it being banned or restricted in some countries; it made around $36m in the US alone. In France, it was reported audiences were queueing round the block for two hours or more to get a ticket.\nThe disparity between Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider became clear: critical reaction to the film aided Bertolucci's reputation as an international auteur, and both he and Brando were nominated for Oscars for the film. Brando, now doubly legendary for making Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather during the same period, is reported to have made around $3m out of Last Tango, as he took a share of the profits; Schneider recalled she was paid around $4,000. She appeared in full-frontal nudity; Brando never appeared naked in the film.\nThe young woman found the overnight fame increasingly hard to deal with. She told interviewers when the film came out that she had slept with 50 men and 20 women and \"had tried heroin\", because, she later explained, that although this was untrue, she was seen [as] \"that sexy bimbo\". Her erratic behaviour, she said, was down to being afraid. \"To be suddenly famous all over the world was frightening,\" she said. \"I didn't have bodyguards like they do today. People thought I was just like my character, and I would make up stories for the press, but that wasn't me\u2026 It made me go mad. I got into drugs\u2026 it was like an escape from reality. It was the 70s and at that time, it was all going on.\"\nHer cousin, Vanessa Schneider, has said of her that she was also a victim of the double standards of the time: \"For puritanical viewers, she was an easy woman who made pornography. It was brutal for her, especially since it wasn't at all in her nature \u2013 she was pretty modest, reserved and fairly conservative in certain respects.\"\n\"People thought I was like the girl in the movie, but that wasn't me,\" Maria Schneider declared in a 2007 interview. \"I felt very sad because I was treated like a sex symbol, I wanted to be recognised as an actress, and the whole scandal and the aftermath of the film turned me a little crazy and I had a breakdown.\" Schneider also revealed that she tried to take her life during this period.\nLater on, Schneider would get sober, but although she made around 50 films during her career (including the critically acclaimed 1975 film The Passenger, co-starring Jack Nicholson) she remarked that \"Last Tango is still the one everyone asks me about.\" She died in 2011, from cancer.\n\"The unfortunate thing is Maria Schneider gave an incredible performance in that film, and you could see how her career could have taken a different path,\" Matt Dillon says. \"But she already had so many strikes against her. Her family of origin was a very messy situation. She was abandoned by her parents and then abandoned by the people that she worked with. I think this abandonment followed her.\"\nSchneider is not the only female actor of that era who suffered because of the hype around an erotic movie they starred in \u2013 Sylvia Kristel also found it hard to escape the sensation created by 1974's soft porn movie Emmanuelle, in which she had the leading role, and which also featured a rape scene. Nor was it only women who suffered making films with sexual content; Schneider would later say that \"even Brando said he felt raped and manipulated\" during the infamous Last Tango scene.\n\"It was an era of celebrity directors,\" Anna Smith, host of the podcast Girls on Film, tells the BBC. \"And the pattern seems to be mainly domineering male directors exploiting and bullying younger actresses. The entitlement of some of these lauded men enabled them to exert control over women.\"\n\"We had this idea of the creator, the director that has the supreme power,\" says Vartolomei, \"and that they were a sort of guru of directing, and that all the people around him were listening to him as if he was God. I think that was the problem back then. Now we're more protected and our voice is heard, and it is also valued, which [it] wasn't back then.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Snow White became 2025's most divisive film\n\u2022 10 of the best films to watch in March\n\u2022 Why cult film Emmanuelle is 'extremely problematic' \nBut Being Maria director Jessica Palud points out that one of the more extraordinary aspects of Schneider's character was that long before the era of #MeToo, she was speaking out about what happened on the set of Last Tango in Paris. \"The thing is that what I really found interesting and touching about her is that although it was in the 1970s and at the time, many young actresses would get assaulted or raped, but they kept it inside. Maria was extremely vocal and clear in interviews\u2026 she would speak up, but she wasn't listened to.\"\u00a0\nSchneider's experience on Last Tango was eventually taken seriously in 2016, when footage of Bertolucci's 2013 interview with Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise about the infamous scene and his desire for Schneider's humiliation to be real resurfaced. This time, it caused outrage. Some did not realise that the sex scene was, however traumatic, only simulated by Brando and Schneider. The then 76-year-old director called the furore \"ridiculous\" and reiterated that Schneider knew about the scene beforehand.\nAll three of the main storytellers of Last Tango in Paris \u2013 Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider \u2013 are now dead. Knowing that the horror, shock, upset and fury seen on Maria Schneider's face is real, and deliberately provoked, should the film, as French newspaper Le Monde pondered after the cancellation of a 2024 screening in Paris due to protests, carry some kind of warning?\n\"I have long thought that the perceived canon of cinematic greats needs re-examining \u2013 as it comes from an inherently patriarchal place,\" says Smith. \"I think it's healthy to revisit classics from a modern perspective; I hope our understanding of the damage that can be caused by certain attitudes and practices has evolved.\"\nBeing Maria, Palud says, attempts to show that, but she says that \"I did not want to judge nor condemn, but to show the system and show what needs to change in the system for this younger generation to be protected. There's still a lot to do. But a scene like this wouldn't happen now, thank God.\"\nVartolomei adds: \"I feel this movie is clearing things up for Maria, along with Vanessa Schneider's book. Back then, Maria was considered a victim, but for me she's far from that, as she found the strength to talk, for the story to be heard, even if she decided to talk in a society that wasn't ready to receive her voice. But now I'm just happy that we are finally able to hear her.\"\nBeing Maria has a US-wide release from 4 April.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

The European Union has vowed a united response, and China has threatened countermeasures.\nRatings agencies like Fitch have warned that the mass tariff hikes could result in lower growth, higher inflation and potentially a recession in some parts of the world.\nHow will India - Asia's third largest economy - navigate these global tremors?\nTrump has dealt the most brutal blow to Asian countries, slapping 34% tariffs on China in addition to the 20% previously levied. Vietnam and Cambodia will have to pay 46% and 49% respectively.\nIn relative terms, at 27% India has fared better.\nBut the rate is still steep and will severely affect major \"labour intensive exports\", says Priyanka Kishore of the consultancy Asia Decoded. \"That will likely have a knock-on impact on domestic demand and headline gross domestic product at a time when growth is already stuttering,\" said Ms Kishore.\nBut the new trade realities also throw up opportunities for India.\nIts new tariff differential with Asian peers may potentially lead to some export re-routing. \"We can bring the footwear and garments business from Asian peers if we get our act together,\" says Nilesh Shah, a veteran fund manager.\nThis will take time though.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government will thus have to be strategic in how it navigates the situation.\nForemost, the announcement should \"give the government a greater sense of urgency in wrapping up a trade deal with the US\", says Rahul Ahluwalia, a public policy expert who previously worked for a government department. \"The US is our largest export market, so this is serious stuff.\" \nIndia exports some $91bn (\u00a369bn) in goods to the US, which account for 18% of its overall exports. Hectic trade negotiations have been under way with a fall deadline for conclusion. Ahluwalia says that deadline could now be compressed and brought forward.\nWhile doing that, India must also expand export markets beyond the US and focus on regions where tariffs remain low, such as Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa,  recommends Indian trade research agency GTRI.\nIn the last couple of years, India has shown a renewed appetite for trade deals, launching free trade agreement (FTA) talks with a range of countries and blocs, including the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nLast year, Delhi signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union.\nExperts say talks with other partners could now be expedited as cracks deepen between the US and many other global economies over Trump's actions.\nBut even as trade negotiations carry on with global partners, the government will need a plan on how it deals with the domestic fallout of Trump's decision.\nImpact on sectors that employ millions of people - like gems and jewellery and textiles - is likely to be significant. The government will need to extend support through means like expanding production-linked subsidies to ensure that India's domestic industry stays globally competitive and can leverage the new opportunities this has thrown up, according to the consultancy, Ernst & Young\nThe tariffs are \"fundamentally reshaping the global trading system\", says Agneshwar Sen, a trade policy expert at Ernst & Young India. This will require a \"fundamental revaluation of trading strategies\" as new supply chains emerge, he adds.\nIndia will also have to be mindful of other risk factors that emerge from this  - such as \"Chinese dumping\", says Mr Shah.\nAs it becomes more difficult for Chinese goods to enter the US, these will have to find other markets. And there are few others that are as large as India.\n\"The global South accounts for more than 20% of global consumption and is where the new middle class is being created. This is where China will attempt to sell,\" according to Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital, an investment management company in Singapore.\nFor the moment there's little clarity and no official word from the government on what its plans are.\nIndia has already reduced tariffs on some goods including high-end motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Unlike Canada, Mexico or the European Union, Modi's government has adopted a conciliatory approach to Trump and these announcements are unlikely to trigger a retaliation, say experts.\nIndian businesses will now most likely face a period of uncertainty which is unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\"Clearly, the (Trump) administration wants even broader and deeper tariff cuts. The question is what, if anything, will satisfy the Trump administration?\", Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment told the BBC.\nIt is a million dollar question, for which there are no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Being Maria, a new film starring Matt Dillon and Anamaria Vartolomei, explores the life of Maria Schneider and the making of one of the most notorious films in cinema history.\nIt may be the most infamous scene in the entire history of cinema. The sexually explicit drama Last Tango in Paris, made by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1972, is the story of an affair between a middle-aged man, Paul, and a young woman, Jeanne, in a Paris apartment. The notorious \"butter scene\" was not in the original script and elements of it were made without 19-year-old actress Maria Schneider's prior consent.\nWarning: This article contains themes of sexual assault that some may find upsetting.\u00a0\nSchneider struggled with drug addiction and her mental health for years after the film's release, but her story, and the making of Last Tango in Paris, is now being told through the film Being Maria. It stars Matt Dillon as Marlon Brando, who played Paul, and Anamaria Vartolomei as Schneider. The film's French director Jessica Palud adapted the story from a 2018 memoir by journalist Vanessa Schneider, Maria's cousin.\n\"I think we have to look at the context of the time of Last Tango in Paris, it's now fifty years since the film was made,\" Matt Dillon tells the BBC. \"That time was a different time, but it's very important to look at it now from a different perspective.\n\"It was really a traumatic experience for her. And not just at the time it happened, but as it continued to follow her and haunt her wherever she went in her life, in so many ways.\"\nBeing Maria explores Schneider's background: she was the product of an affair between a famous French actor, Daniel G\u00e9lin, and a Romanian model. She first met her father as a teenager, and he introduced her to film sets. Last Tango in Paris was her first leading role, and she would later recall in a 2007 interview, then in her fifties, that she was persuaded to take the part instead of starring in a film with French film star Alain Delon, and, at the age of 19, \"didn't understand all of the film's sexual content\". She \"had a bad feeling about it all\", she said, but was told by her agency she couldn't possibly turn down working with Marlon Brando, one of the greatest stars of 20th-Century cinema.\nShe remembered what happened on the day of filming that scene, in which her character is raped by Brando's, using butter as a lubricant. \"That scene wasn't in the original script. The truth is it was Marlon who came up with the idea. They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry\u2026 I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologise,\" she said. \"Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie,' but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears.\n\"Thankfully, there was just one take.\"\nBertolucci would later talk about why he withheld details of the scene from Schneider, saying: \"I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress. I wanted her to react humiliated.\" He insisted that it was only the use of the butter that had surprised the actress, but Matt Dillon says what happened was \"really wrong\".\n\"It's something that we often do, actors, we won't tell the other actor, or the director will encourage us to not reveal what we're going to do, so we can get a real reaction,\" he says. \"But it was really wrong, with a scene that was so sensitive, to do something like that.\"\u00a0\nJessica Palud tells the BBC that recreating the rape scene \"couldn't be avoided\" in Being Maria, but this time, the audience sees events from Maria Schneider's perspective. \"I couldn't avoid shooting this scene because it was the very moment in which her life completely switches. Everything goes wrong from there,\" Palud says. \"It was important to have the scene from her point of view, in her body, in her gaze, what she went through, and the fact that there were witnesses. Maria was being assaulted in the presence of the whole crew, who were observing and not reacting.\"\nThis time the scene was prepared using an intimacy co-ordinator, which 61-year-old Dillon says was his first time working with one. \"I said to the intimacy co-ordinator, 'do you know what the scene is about?'\" he recalls. \"They said yes, and I said, 'Because you can probably trace back the role of an intimacy co-ordinator to that moment, in that film.'\"\u00a0\nThe use of an intimacy co-ordinator, who acts as a choreographer and a liaison between actors and production during simulated sex and nude scenes, is increasingly standard in the industry since the #MeToo movement. It now makes headlines when they're declined, including by Mikey Madison in Oscar winner Anora, or when Gwyneth Paltrow revealed that she told one to \"step a little bit back\" during her sex scenes with Timoth\u00e9e\u00a0Chalamet in Marty Supreme.\n\"I don't think it's a bad thing, I think it can evolve into being something good,\" Dillon says of using intimacy co-ordinators. \"It seems they're there to prevent people from crossing boundaries, but in fact it's creating boundaries that give opportunities for different ways of approaching these scenes. I hope that's how it evolves rather than people feeling like 'they're here to tell us what we can and can't do.' And Anamaria and I were very comfortable.\"\nAnamaria Vartolomei (who also made Golden Lion winner Happening, featuring scenes of illegal abortion) says that although she felt \"safe, protected and guided\" shooting the rape scene on the Being Maria shoot, she still became upset. \"This scene was really violent,\" she tells the BBC. \"I couldn't imagine what it was for Maria as she felt it for real. I'm just playing her. But this thing really happened to her, and she had no one around her. She just had people looking at her without doing anything. I think the violence of it was double because she didn't have the support I had on set, but I still felt it was really hard.\u00a0\n\"I was so emotional that day. I couldn't stop crying because I feel I accumulated the violence of the scene when I saw it on screen. When I had to play it, all my tears came out. I think it's very brutal. And it's insane to think that somebody could do this.\"\u00a0\nMaria Schneider was not only professionally unsupported on set, but she also lacked the experience to know that Bertolucci couldn't make her to do the scene. \"I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that,\" she would say later.\u00a0\nBut it was also the sensation the film Last Tango in Paris caused when it was shown from October 1972 that would undo Schneider. Despite (or helped by) it being banned or restricted in some countries; it made around $36m in the US alone. In France, it was reported audiences were queueing round the block for two hours or more to get a ticket.\nThe disparity between Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider became clear: critical reaction to the film aided Bertolucci's reputation as an international auteur, and both he and Brando were nominated for Oscars for the film. Brando, now doubly legendary for making Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather during the same period, is reported to have made around $3m out of Last Tango, as he took a share of the profits; Schneider recalled she was paid around $4,000. She appeared in full-frontal nudity; Brando never appeared naked in the film.\nThe young woman found the overnight fame increasingly hard to deal with. She told interviewers when the film came out that she had slept with 50 men and 20 women and \"had tried heroin\", because, she later explained, that although this was untrue, she was seen [as] \"that sexy bimbo\". Her erratic behaviour, she said, was down to being afraid. \"To be suddenly famous all over the world was frightening,\" she said. \"I didn't have bodyguards like they do today. People thought I was just like my character, and I would make up stories for the press, but that wasn't me\u2026 It made me go mad. I got into drugs\u2026 it was like an escape from reality. It was the 70s and at that time, it was all going on.\"\nHer cousin, Vanessa Schneider, has said of her that she was also a victim of the double standards of the time: \"For puritanical viewers, she was an easy woman who made pornography. It was brutal for her, especially since it wasn't at all in her nature \u2013 she was pretty modest, reserved and fairly conservative in certain respects.\"\n\"People thought I was like the girl in the movie, but that wasn't me,\" Maria Schneider declared in a 2007 interview. \"I felt very sad because I was treated like a sex symbol, I wanted to be recognised as an actress, and the whole scandal and the aftermath of the film turned me a little crazy and I had a breakdown.\" Schneider also revealed that she tried to take her life during this period.\nLater on, Schneider would get sober, but although she made around 50 films during her career (including the critically acclaimed 1975 film The Passenger, co-starring Jack Nicholson) she remarked that \"Last Tango is still the one everyone asks me about.\" She died in 2011, from cancer.\n\"The unfortunate thing is Maria Schneider gave an incredible performance in that film, and you could see how her career could have taken a different path,\" Matt Dillon says. \"But she already had so many strikes against her. Her family of origin was a very messy situation. She was abandoned by her parents and then abandoned by the people that she worked with. I think this abandonment followed her.\"\nSchneider is not the only female actor of that era who suffered because of the hype around an erotic movie they starred in \u2013 Sylvia Kristel also found it hard to escape the sensation created by 1974's soft porn movie Emmanuelle, in which she had the leading role, and which also featured a rape scene. Nor was it only women who suffered making films with sexual content; Schneider would later say that \"even Brando said he felt raped and manipulated\" during the infamous Last Tango scene.\n\"It was an era of celebrity directors,\" Anna Smith, host of the podcast Girls on Film, tells the BBC. \"And the pattern seems to be mainly domineering male directors exploiting and bullying younger actresses. The entitlement of some of these lauded men enabled them to exert control over women.\"\n\"We had this idea of the creator, the director that has the supreme power,\" says Vartolomei, \"and that they were a sort of guru of directing, and that all the people around him were listening to him as if he was God. I think that was the problem back then. Now we're more protected and our voice is heard, and it is also valued, which [it] wasn't back then.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Snow White became 2025's most divisive film\n\u2022 10 of the best films to watch in March\n\u2022 Why cult film Emmanuelle is 'extremely problematic' \nBut Being Maria director Jessica Palud points out that one of the more extraordinary aspects of Schneider's character was that long before the era of #MeToo, she was speaking out about what happened on the set of Last Tango in Paris. \"The thing is that what I really found interesting and touching about her is that although it was in the 1970s and at the time, many young actresses would get assaulted or raped, but they kept it inside. Maria was extremely vocal and clear in interviews\u2026 she would speak up, but she wasn't listened to.\"\u00a0\nSchneider's experience on Last Tango was eventually taken seriously in 2016, when footage of Bertolucci's 2013 interview with Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise about the infamous scene and his desire for Schneider's humiliation to be real resurfaced. This time, it caused outrage. Some did not realise that the sex scene was, however traumatic, only simulated by Brando and Schneider. The then 76-year-old director called the furore \"ridiculous\" and reiterated that Schneider knew about the scene beforehand.\nAll three of the main storytellers of Last Tango in Paris \u2013 Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider \u2013 are now dead. Knowing that the horror, shock, upset and fury seen on Maria Schneider's face is real, and deliberately provoked, should the film, as French newspaper Le Monde pondered after the cancellation of a 2024 screening in Paris due to protests, carry some kind of warning?\n\"I have long thought that the perceived canon of cinematic greats needs re-examining \u2013 as it comes from an inherently patriarchal place,\" says Smith. \"I think it's healthy to revisit classics from a modern perspective; I hope our understanding of the damage that can be caused by certain attitudes and practices has evolved.\"\nBeing Maria, Palud says, attempts to show that, but she says that \"I did not want to judge nor condemn, but to show the system and show what needs to change in the system for this younger generation to be protected. There's still a lot to do. But a scene like this wouldn't happen now, thank God.\"\nVartolomei adds: \"I feel this movie is clearing things up for Maria, along with Vanessa Schneider's book. Back then, Maria was considered a victim, but for me she's far from that, as she found the strength to talk, for the story to be heard, even if she decided to talk in a society that wasn't ready to receive her voice. But now I'm just happy that we are finally able to hear her.\"\nBeing Maria has a US-wide release from 4 April.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From Drop to A Minecraft Movie, these are the films to stream at home and watch at the cinema this month.\nDavid Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-tinged drama stars Vincent Cassel as Karsh, an inventor who looks a lot like Cronenberg himself. Grief-stricken by the death of his wife (Diane Kruger), Karsh develops camera systems that can be buried with corpses, so that their relatives can watch them on monitors as they decompose. The invention catches on, but one night some graves containing these high-tech \"shrouds\" are desecrated, so Karsh and his brother-in-law (Guy Pearce) have to work out who was responsible. This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a \"restrained, even elegant\" film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement, says Steve Pond at The Wrap. \"It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief\u2026 Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore.\"\nReleased on 18 April in the US\nThree of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Muriel, the fianc\u00e9e of an upstanding Korean War veteran, Lee (Will Poulter). He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races. Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the film a \"quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast\", adding: \"On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting.\" On the other hand, the BBC's Caryn James considers it \"a disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film\".\nReleased on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France\nOn a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family \u2013 a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. \"The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,\" says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, \"complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work.\"\nReleased on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland\nRyan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music \"can pierce the veil between life and death\". The town is soon infested with vampires \u2013 but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. \"The film is very genre-fluid,\" Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family.\"\nReleased internationally on 18 April\nFirst dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. \"[Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,\" says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. \"Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.\"\nReleased internationally on 11 April\nWhen Alex Garland was making his last film, Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the \"war is hell\" concept \"to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion\", says Kevin Maher in The Times. \"This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK\nIf you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles \u2013 but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. \"Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,\" says David Hughes in Time Out, \"Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland\nWhat if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. \"It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,\" Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21.\nReleased on 10 April on Prime\nA Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. \"By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things \u2013 a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions \u2013 is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,\" says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. \"There's an 'anything goes' attitude here\u2026 [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore.\"\nReleased internationally on 4 April\nWith a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends \u2013 one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing \u2013 embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine. David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angarano \"graduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director\" with Sacramento. \"Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US\nAng Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. \"An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,\" says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, \"but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves\".\nReleased on 18 April in the US and Canada\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing\nDriving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.\nIn nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.\nAlmost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.\nMyanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.\nWhat we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.\n\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days. \nHer 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha was a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.\n\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.\nWhen the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.\nSai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.\nWhen we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.\nEven before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.\nThis means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.\nThe military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.\nAnd so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.\nNeeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.\n\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.\nWorking under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.\nThe rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.\nSitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.\nOthers gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.\nAgonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.\nBut the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.\nAmong the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.\nMany of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.\nAccess to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.\nClose to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.\n\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.\nTheir bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.\nMyanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.\nParks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.\nMandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.\nBut tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.\n\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"\nShe works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.\n\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.\n\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.\nAnother elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"\nMost of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.\nParts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.\nShwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.\nThere were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.\nZar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.\nWe couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.\nAs the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.\nNan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.\n\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.\n\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\"",

        "article_text": "Charlotte Edwards was the first England captain to lead in more than 200 internationals \nEngland have appointed legendary former captain Charlotte Edwards as their new head coach.\nThe 45-year-old, England's all-time leading run-scorer, replaces Jon Lewis, who was sacked in March after the 16-0 Ashes hammering in Australia.\nEdwards played more than 300 times for England in a 19-year career, including in excess of 200 games as captain.\nIn a 10-year spell in charge, Edwards won three Ashes series and both the 50-over and 20-over World Cups in 2009.\nShe was surprisingly sacked in 2016 and replaced by Heather Knight, who then enjoyed her own nine-year reign.\nKnight was also sacked in the aftermath of the Ashes debacle but will remain as a player, now under coach Edwards.\n\"I cannot wait to take this team forward and drive us to success. It means the world to me to have the three lions on my chest once again,\" said Edwards.\n\"Leading England as captain was my life for 10 years and I will forever be passionate about this team and our legacy. We have such a talented group of players, and I am excited about working with them and improving them both as individuals and as a team.\"\nEngland are yet to name a new captain. Vice-captain Nat Sciver-Brunt has previously stated she would be interested in the role, while off-spinner Charlie Dean said she \"wouldn't say no\".\nThe upheaval at the top of the England team comes as a result of a review into the Ashes, led by director of women's cricket Clare Connor.\nRealistically, Edwards was the standout candidate to lead a rebuild, with Connor describing her as a \"proven winner\". Following her stellar playing career, she has enjoyed considerable success as a coach.\nHer Southern Vipers have been the strongest team in English domestic cricket and Edwards' Southern Brave won the women's Hundred in 2023.\nOverseas, Edwards has led Mumbai Indians to two titles in three seasons at the Women's Premier League in India. In 2022, Edwards' Sydney Sixers were beaten in the final of Australia's Big Bash.\n\"When we drew up the criteria for the job it became apparent very quickly that Charlotte was the outstanding candidate,\" Connor added.\n\"She has the experience, passion and expertise to lead this team to success. The results she has achieved as a head coach in multiple environments, since retiring as one of the greatest ever England players, is testament to her relentless drive and the standards she sets for those around her.\n\"She is a proven winner; she has won repeatedly as a player and now as a coach. She possesses a deep knowledge of the game, both in England and across the world, and she understands the importance of creating an environment that is both challenging and supportive.\"\nEdwards will lead England in home white-ball series against West Indies and India this summer, building up to the 50-over World Cup in India in October.\nEdwards' former England team-mate Lydia Greenway, who has also coached with her at Mumbai, is confident the appointment will move England \"in the right direction\" after a difficult two years. \nA thrilling drawn Ashes in the summer of 2023 gave a sense of optimism under Lewis, but the two T20 World Cup disappointments either side of that and this year's thrashing to Australia left the team at a new low.\n\"The one thing with Lottie is the standards she sets, and what she expects of you as a player,\" Greenway told BBC Sport. \"Straight away, I've got no doubt in my mind that she'll go into that group and set out her expectations and her standards from the word go. \n\"I think everyone should be really excited by this appointment. We don't know whether there will be the success that we want, but what we do know is she'll move things in the right direction.\" \nOf the five domestic or franchise teams that Edwards has coached since 2020, they have finished in the top three of the group stages in their respective competitions in 16 of the 19 attempts. \nGreenway cautioned that Edwards would need to be given time to \"embed her style\" but the relationships that she has forged with England's players during her coaching tenure so far will be crucial. \nDean and opening batter Maia Bouchier have played for Southern Vipers under Edwards, spinner Sophie Ecclestone linked up with her at Sydney Sixers while experienced batters Danni Wyatt-Hodge and Knight played under her captaincy.\n\"It was one of the questions prior to the last cycle of recruiting a head coach: was it too soon for her to be working with some of her former teammates,\" Greenway said.\n\"But we're in a position where she's already gone through that experience of working with them and she's established herself now as a coach.\n\"When you go from playing to coaching, it does take you a while to get used to what your role is, so she's managed to navigate that journey already and she's clearly ready for it.\"\nKnight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nBy Ffion Wynne, BBC Sport journalist\nIn the end, Edwards' appointment felt almost as inevitable as the sackings of Lewis and Knight which came before her. \nThere were murmurings of her potentially taking the vacancy before Lewis took the role in 2022, but Edwards wanted a little more time to establish herself in domestic cricket and around the franchise circuit. \nShe has done that with so much success, and Mumbai Indians' second Women's Premier League win just a couple of weeks ago felt poetic, like the cricket world was serving the ECB with a timely reminder of what and who was waiting for them.\nThere, she has also established a relationship with Sciver-Brunt, which could be crucial if the all-rounder is named as England's next captain. \nEdwards has a monumental rebuilding task on her hands, not only in developing the new captain but essentially, she needs to rebrand the team altogether. \nA humiliating month in Australia saw the team's fitness and athleticism questioned - not for the first time, either. Their attitude was criticised, fans accused them of not caring enough and there was tension between players and the media, too. \nCombined with how performances have stagnated on the pitch, particularly in the field and the inability to perform under pressure, Edwards has got her work cut out.\nBut those who know her best, including both Greenway and Dean, say there is nobody better suited to taking on a challenge. \nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "summary": "'Everyone should be excited by this' - England appoint Edwards as head coachImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Charlotte Edwards was the first England captain to lead in more than 200 internationals Stephan ShemiltChief Cricket ReporterPublished1 April 2025458 CommentsEngland have appointed legendary former captain Charlotte Edwards as their new head coach.The 45-year-old, England's all-time leading run-scorer, replaces Jon Lewis, who was sacked in March after the 16-0 Ashes hammering in Australia.Edwards played more than 300 times for England in a 19-year career, including in excess of 200 games as captain.In a 10-year spell in charge, Edwards won three Ashes series and both the 50-over and 20-over World Cups in 2009.She was surprisingly sacked in 2016 and replaced by Heather Knight, who then enjoyed her own nine-year reign.Knight was also sacked in the aftermath of the Ashes debacle but will remain as a player, now under coach Edwards. Vice-captain Nat Sciver-Brunt has previously stated she would be interested in the role, while off-spinner Charlie Dean said she \"wouldn't say no\".The upheaval at the top of the England team comes as a result of a review into the Ashes, led by director of women's cricket Clare Connor.Realistically, Edwards was the standout candidate to lead a rebuild, with Connor describing her as a \"proven winner\". 'Everyone should be excited by this'Edwards' former England team-mate Lydia Greenway, who has also coached with her at Mumbai, is confident the appointment will move England \"in the right direction\" after a difficult two years. Following her stellar playing career, she has enjoyed considerable success as a coach.Her Southern Vipers have been the strongest team in English domestic cricket and Edwards' Southern Brave won the women's Hundred in 2023.Overseas, Edwards has led Mumbai Indians to two titles in three seasons at the Women's Premier League in India. We have such a talented group of players, and I am excited about working with them and improving them both as individuals and as a team.",

        "article_text": "Jonny Bairstow and James Anderson will not face off this season after Yorkshire were promoted and Lancashire relegated\nThe 2025 County Championship begins on Friday - and, remarkably for early April, the weather is set to be glorious.\nBut which county sides will sparkle this season and whose outlook is gloomy?\nThe BBC's local radio county cricket commentators and online journalists - who will be providing ball-by-ball radio and live text commentary throughout the season on the BBC Sport website and app - take a look at each club's prospects... \nCounty Championship preview: Who can stop Surrey?\nJennings 'job' is to win Lancashire silverware\nBears must spread wickets around - Hannon-Dalby\n2024 season - Eighth in Division Two\nDave Fletcher - BBC Radio Derby\nGiven Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two in 2024, things can surely only improve. \nThey did at least win a game last year, unlike 2023, but it was another bitterly disappointing watch for the County Ground faithful.\nThey were not helped by an opening round washout against Gloucestershire last season which meant they were playing catch-up from the off.\nThat appears unlikely to be repeated so a quick start \u2013 against the same opposition - is essential.\nThey have added Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell to the squad and he will be joined by returning Kiwi quick bowler Blair Tickner, whose spell last season was all too brief.\nThere's a new captain at the helm, too, although it is a familiar figure. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad.

        "summary": "A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.They've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.With Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.But if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.Lancashire - 'Red Rose favourites for promotion'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Rocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)Scott Read - BBC Radio LancashireSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. Last season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.Tall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.There is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.Middlesex - 'Williamson signing a coup'2024 season - Third in Division TwoKevin Hand - BBC Radio LondonThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).The rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.With the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.The mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.In the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. It is a good recipe to have.Sussex - 'Experienced players will be crucial'2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)Adrian Harms - BBC Radio SussexThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.During that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.Farbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.However, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.But don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.Provided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.Sussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.Warwickshire - 'Bears have no shortage of talent'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season2024 season - Seventh in Division OneMike Taylor - BBC Radio WMA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.Tickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.Already in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.Winter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.The big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.Durham - 'Bowling the key issue'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Matthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups2024 season - Fifth in Division OneMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio NewcastleDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. It was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.The former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.The signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.Northamptonshire - 'Lehmann arrival brings positivity'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Darren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 20182024 season - Fourth in Division TwoAndrew Radd - BBC Radio NorthamptonshireThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.After being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.With opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine.",

        "article_text": "Our lives are surprisingly dependent upon this extremely light and unreactive gas, yet supplies of it are remarkably fragile.\nNancy Washton remembers the sinking feeling she got when she heard her helium delivery wouldn't be arriving. In early 2022, she and her team of chemists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the United States were abruptly told by their supplier that they wouldn't get their usual shipment of the gas, which they use in a range of different experiments.\nShortages meant there wasn't enough to go around, and the laboratory would simply have to make do with less. In the first weeks of that year, the laboratory's supply dropped well below the 2,500 litres (660 gallons) it normally received. By April, just a couple of months later, it was getting less than half the helium it needed.\nWith a small fleet of instruments that require regular top-ups of liquid helium, the lab had no choice but to sacrifice the greediest of these in order to continue running the most important. Washton's own instrument of choice was a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer \u2013 a huge, hulking tower, capable of peering into the molecular structure of atoms. Such measurements can contribute to the development of new batteries and energy storage systems, for example.\nThe spectrometer was the only one of its kind in North America, and less than 12 months after its installation it was providing results that were potentially game-changing. When turned on samples of magnesium oxide, for example, it showed the\u00a0minerals are capable of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.\u00a0Such \"carbon mineralisation\" has long been explored as a way of combatting greenhouse gas emissions, but the results showed how useful these minerals could be.\n\"There had been no definitive evidence of carbonate formations on these particular types of magnesium oxides [before],\" says Washton.\u00a0\"I just could not believe the data. The fact that we had managed to get this data, and the beauty of the story it told, was just amazing,\" Washton says.\nBut then all of that work abruptly had to stop.\nThe rate at which the spectrometer consumed helium made it a problem. In a process Washton later described as \"traumatising\", the instrument was de-energised and mothballed, its experiments suspended. It would sit inert and useless for several months until more helium could be secured. Today, the device is back up and running \u2013 the lab has the helium it needs. For the time being.\nWhat is helium used for?\nHelium is an inert gas, which means that it does not react readily with other substances. It has the lowest boiling point of any element at -269C (-452F) and a low density.\nThe space industry uses helium to keep satellite instruments cool and to clean out rocket engines. It is also used to pressurise the fuel tanks of space rockets.\nHelium also cools equipment within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.\nHelium is often used to fill party balloons, weather balloons and airships due to its low density.\nDeep-sea divers rely on helium to control the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen they get from their breathing apparatus, since this helps to avoid decompression sickness.\nThe episode highlights how vulnerable helium supplies are and why there is now a desperate scramble around the world to find ways of conserving and recycling this crucial gas.\nThe shortages in 2022 didn't just affect researchers. You might not realise it, but many of the products and processes you encounter each day depend on helium.\nHospitals, for example, are the world's largest consumers of helium, accounting for around 32% of the global market. The gas is used to cool magnets in vital diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. Helium is also used in the manufacturing of the semiconductors (computer chips), which are at the heart of electronic devices. It's also used in welding and even pressurises the fuel tanks of rockets that put satellites into orbit. Plus, helium is part of the gas mixture that inflates car safety airbags.\nHelium is odourless, extremely light and, unlike another very light element once used in airships, hydrogen, it will never burst into flames. When cooled, it only condenses into a liquid at the stunningly low temperature of roughly 4.2 Kelvin, or -269C/-452F. Plus, under normal atmospheric conditions, helium will not freeze even at temperatures as low as absolute zero, or 0 Kelvin (-273C/-460F). This makes it incredibly useful.\u00a0\n\"Helium is a magical element,\" says Sophia Hayes, professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis. \"There is nothing else like it in the Universe.\"\nLiquid helium takes on strange properties when it is chilled almost to absolute zero, turning into a superfluid that flows without friction. Stir a cup of superfluid helium and the liquid inside would theoretically keep spinning forever. Superfluid helium has become vital for large-scale superconductors, such as those used by the Large Hadron Collider experiment at Cern on the border between Switzerland and France.\nBut since 2006, helium has repeatedly been in short supply. The most recent extended shortage started in January 2022 before easing the following year. But helium supplies have remained precarious, with producers struggling to keep up with demand.\nThat demand is only expected to rise further \u2013 with some analysts predicting that it will double by 2035 due to helium's key roles in semiconductor and electric vehicle battery manufacturing, as well as in aerospace applications.\nThere are only two sources of helium: the highly-energetic nuclear fusion reactions inside stars, including our Sun, and the slow decay radioactive elements in Earth's crust. Since we can't artificially manufacture helium with today's technology, that means it is essentially a finite resource. Instead, helium is typically mined alongside natural gas by drilling deep wells into the ground, but only a handful of companies across the world currently do this.\nHelium is also a remarkably uncooperative element. The extraction and burning of fossil fuels have caused increasing amounts of helium to build up in the Earth's atmosphere in recent decades, depleting the resource otherwise locked inside our planet.\nBut helium is so light that it is also slowly leaking out of the Earth's atmosphere and heading off into space. In its superfluid state, it has a habit of finding its way out of even the tiniest cracks and holes. It can even flow up walls in this superfluid state. That makes it difficult to handle and store \u2013 it can be easily lost after use.\nAll of this makes the helium supply chain fragile \u2013 resulting in four worldwide helium shortages in the last twenty years alone.\nThe most recent severe shortage in 2022 that scuppered some of Washton's research occurred after a series of fires at a major Russian gas processing plant in the Amur region of Siberia. The war in Ukraine compounded the problem by further choking supplies at the same time a helium plant in Qatar went offline for planned maintenance. Meanwhile, the crude helium enrichment unit at the US National Helium Reserve was shut down during the summer of 2021 and again for four months at the end of January 2022. The US shutdown removed around 10% of the global production capacity of helium from the supply chain. Taken together, these incidents led to a sudden shortage and highlighted just how vulnerable the world's helium supply could be. By 2023, the industrial sale price of helium had nearly doubled from what it was five years before, reaching an all-time high.\nAlthough helium production has since increased, the world yet again faces potential disruption, leaving market prices volatile. In September 2024, the EU began enforcing new sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, including banning imports of helium. While Russia accounts for only 1% of the EU's helium imports, the move marked a further tightening of supplies. On top of that, the sale of the world's largest helium reserve \u2013 the US Federal Helium Reserve \u2013 has triggered further uncertainty.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why the world is running out of sand\n\u2022\u00a0How Google's ballons surprised their creator\n\u2022\u00a0The world's forgotten greenhouse gas\nFor several decades, the US has supplied around one-tenth of the world's helium from an underground federal stockpile established a century ago near Amarillo, Texas. But in June 2024, the Bureau of Land Management, which ran the US helium reserve, sold the last gasp of federal helium to the German gas supplier Messer. Ahead of the handover, the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine released a report warning that the sale of the strategic reserve to a commercial company could heighten uncertainty in the helium market.\u00a0\nTrade bodies including The Compressed Gas Association and the Advanced Medical Technology Association \u2013 AdvaMed \u2013 urged the US government to delay the sale on the grounds that it risked a \"supply chain crisis\". And healthcare contractor Premier Inc, which sources helium on behalf of thousands of hospitals, suggested the sale could have a detrimental impact on patient care.\u00a0\nAlthough these fears are yet to be realised, there are signs that not all is going smoothly.\nWithin months of the sale, Messer was forced to request a temporary restraining order to prevent another shutdown of the crude helium enrichment unit \u2013 this was due to the expiry of a critical lease and a negotiation dispute. The company that ran the enrichment unit was later placed into receivership. Messer, however, says its helium system \"has been operating reliably and without interruption since we acquired it last June, and we anticipate smooth uninterrupted operations in the future\".\nBut a recent analysis of helium supplies suggests that this natural resource is likely to take on growing geopolitical importance over the coming years as demand and competition for the gas increases.\nThe US accounts for about 46% of the global supply of helium, followed by Qatar (38%) and then Algeria (5%). If US supplies were to be disrupted again, the impact would be felt around the world.\nYears of precarious helium supplies and price fluctuations, however, have also forced academic, commercial and clinical bodies to explore more sustainable modes of helium consumption. Firmly in their crosshairs are helium-hungry MRI machines.\nA standard MRI machine requires a little under 2,000 litres of liquid helium to cool its superconducting magnets. Each unit needs occasional top-ups and, without the cooling helium, its magnets would heat up, evaporate the helium reservoir, and expel it in a process called \"quenching\". It's rare, but dire: the helium is lost, and another couple thousand litres of the liquid is required to put the machine back into working order. If a quenching incident causes more serious damage, then the whole MRI machine might need replacing at great expense.\u00a0\nNow, a new breed of MRI machines that require significantly less helium are emerging. Many of these low-helium units need as little as one litre of helium to operate, sealing it in a closed system. In recent years, these machines have already begun appearing in hospitals and research institutions.\u00a0 \u00a0\nBut there are limits. These low-helium scanners are especially expensive, and it would still take many years to replace the more than 35,000 MRI machines that use superconductors worldwide.\nThe new scanners are also only capable of producing magnetic field strengths of around 1.5 Tesla \u2013 roughly half of what their beefier predecessors can put out. \"Higher-field-strength scanners have the potential to scan in finer detail and/or faster than lower-field-strength scanners,\" says Sharon Giles, director of clinical and research imaging operations at King's College London. The use of these low-helium scanners, then, is limited, although Giles says they're still capable of performing routine imaging in a lab setting.\nOther researchers have searched for ways to cut out helium entirely by developing superconducting materials that don't need to be cooled to such extremes.\nMore widely, researchers are starting to shore up their own supplies by recycling. Helium recovery systems can recapture evaporated helium that would otherwise be lost. \"It will allow us to recover about 90% of the helium that we purchase every year,\" says Nicholas Fitzkee, director of Mississippi State University's nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) facility, which is in the process of installing a recovery system. \"We did the calculations when we wrote the proposal and the total cost of the system was just over $300,000 (\u00a3238,000), and it should pay for itself within six years.\"\nBut installing helium recovery technology \u2013 complicated arrangements of pipes, tubing and headers that must be fed through a facility's instruments \u2013 is time-consuming and complex. These systems can fail, leak, and even when done right, Washton worries that some people may not fully appreciate their benefit. \"To make an argument, 'Hey, I need $600,000 (\u00a3476,000) for a couple of helium recovery units', people are like, 'Well, what's that gonna do for us? That's kind of like you're putting in new plumbing',\" she says, explaining that such work doesn't have the \"bling\" factor that helps justify certain other scientific investments.\nBut there may also be some signs of relief on the horizon. Qatar is on course to open a new helium plant by 2027, while other companies have started to look for previously untapped underground fields.\nIn 2016, the world's largest helium reserve was found in Tanzania. It is set to start production in 2025. This was actually the first helium gas field to be discovered deliberately, and the launch of operations there will mark the first time helium has been recovered at scale, rather than as a by-product of polluting natural gas extraction. Major helium reserves have also been discovered in China's Bohai Bay Basin.\nChristopher Ballentine, chair of geochemistry at the University of Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences, contributed to the scientific research that ultimately helped to locate the Tanzanian helium deposit. But he cautions against over-excitement. \"The challenge of finding significant helium deposits to meet the growing global demand requires significant finances and a long lead-in time,\" he says.\nVolatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource is \u2013 and how quickly its supply can be pinched off.\nWashton emphasises the risks: \"Imagine if there's just not enough helium, and your grandma can't get her MRI because its superconductor is dead. This is serious and we need to deal with it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

The visitors are sixth in France's Top 14 table after their recent victory over La Rochelle ended a run of five consecutive league defeats.Clermont booked their place in the knockout stages by snatching a dramatic 33-26 victory in the sixth minute of overtime to qualify at Bath and Bristol's expense.Elsewhere, Sale Sharks face a daunting trip to six-time winners and defending champions Toulouse, who will be without injured talisman Antoine Dupont after he ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee during France's Six Nations win over Ireland last month.Harlequins face an equally difficult task at four-time winners Leinster, while Leicester Tigers travel north to take on Glasgow Warriors.The full Irish contingentAll three Irish provinces which started in this season's competition have reached the knockout stages.Leinster lead the United Rugby Championship (URC) and will be targeting a fifth star on the jersey after finishing top of Pool 2 with a clean sweep of four comfortable wins.Fly-half Sam Prendergast has stepped into retired colossus Johnny Sexton's shoes for club and country seamlessly, while the bulk of Ireland's first-choice pack, including Josh van der Flier and Caelan Doris, ply their trade in Dublin.Munster finished third in Pool 3 to qualify for the last 16 and they will reunited with their former fly-half Ronan O'Gara in the next round.They will travel to the Stade Marcel-Deflandre to face the 2022 and 2023 champions La Rochelle, who are coached by O'Gara.Ireland legends Peter O'Mahony and Conor Murray have retired from the international stage and will want to end their long-standing Munster careers this summer with silverware.Ulster, meanwhile, won just one of their four Pool 1 games and scraped through to the knockout stages on points difference.They will face an away trip to title contenders Bordeaux-Begles, who finished top of Pool 1 after four bonus-point wins, including a 40-19 victory when the two sides last met in December. Scottish and Italian representationDefending URC champions Glasgow are flying the Scottish flag in the last 16 after finishing second in Pool 4.Warriors, who are also currently second in the URC, will welcome Tigers to Scotstoun in fine form after pummelling Johannesburg Lions 42-0 in their most recent outing.George Horne became the club's record try-scorer in their victory over the South African side, while Leicester were narrowly beaten by Saracens in their last Premiership match.Tigers are third in the English top-flight and outgoing head coach Michael Chieka says he will work harder to achieve success domestically and in Europe before leaving the club this summer. Benetton, meanwhile, will make their last-16 debut after a surprise 32-25 victory over two-time champions La Rochelle in their final Pool 2 game.The Italian side boast a large contingent of the  Italy national team, including their fearsome centre partnership of Juan Ignacio Brex and Tommaso Menoncello.Like Italy, Benetton play a free-flowing brand of rugby and will pose a threat in their trip to French side Castres.French dominanceSix of this season's last 16 hail from France. Bordeaux-Begles made light work of the pool stages and in France wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey, who last month broke the record for the most tries scored in a Six Nations campaign, boast one of the deadliest finishers in world rugby.Despite the loss of Dupont, Top 14 leaders Toulouse are also among the favourites to secure a record seventh European crown.Three-time winners Toulon finished top of Pool 4 despite a heavy defeat by Sale Sharks and will be favourites to overcome an under-strength Saracens side.La Rochelle, meanwhile, are without a win in eight matches since they beat Toulouse in January.O'Gara has previously led his side to back-to-back Champions Cup titles but he will have to stop this year's rot if he wishes to overcome his former side Munster.Pool 3 runners-up Castres and Clermont Auvergne make up the French sextet.What's up next?It could be another final between the tournament's two most successful sides on 24 May at Principality Stadium as Toulouse and Leinster both ended up on opposite sides of the draw.Northampton will play a home quarter-final if they can navigate their way past Clermont, while a potential semi-final rematch from last year's competition could await against Leinster.However, a victory for Quins over Leinster and a Leicester win in Glasgow would also set-up an all-Premiership tie in the next round.Quarter-final draw (ties to be played on the weekend 11/12/13 April):Bordeaux-Begles/Ulster v La Rochelle/MunsterToulon/Saracens v Toulouse/Sale SharksLeinster/Harlequins v Glasgow Warriors/Leicester TigersNorthampton Saints/Clermont Auvergne v Castres or BenettonSemi-final draw (ties to be played on the weekend 2/3/4 May):Bordeaux/Ulster/La Rochelle/Munster v Toulon/Saracens/Toulouse/SaleLeinster/Harlequins/Glasgow/Leicester Tigers v Northampton/Clermont/Castres/BenettonRelated topicsMunsterGlasgow WarriorsSaleUlsterNorthampton SaintsLeinsterSaracensRugby UnionLeicester TigersHarlequins",

        "article_text": "The UK exported nearly \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, making it one of the most important markets for thousands of British businesses.\nAfter President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff on nearly all UK products, we spoke to businesses from some of Britain's biggest exporters to find out what it could mean for them.\nThe UK food and drink industry exports a couple of billion pounds worth of goods to the US every year, satisfying Americans's taste for specialist products like smoked salmon, Scotch whisky and artisan cheeses.\nAdam Sopher, co-founder and chief executive at Joe & Seph's, the London-based luxury popcorn-maker, says the mere spectre of tariffs had already been affecting the business.\nUS retailers usually place their orders for Christmas early in the year, but it's had far fewer orders than normal as retailers wait to see what happens.\nJoe & Seph's made \u00a38m in sales last year of which 2%-3% came from the US. \"So it is not huge,\" says Mr Sopher. \"But the US is the biggest popcorn market in the world so we had planned that a lot of our growth would come from there.\"\nAs a consequence, he says, it's now planning to focus on growing its exports to the Middle East and Asia.\nHowever, the 10% tariff was not as bad as he was expecting and US importers aready have to pay a 5.8% tariff on Joe & Seph's goods when they reach American ports.\n\"So essentially what's happened is we're going to go from 5.8% to 10% as opposed to zero to 10%,\" says Mr Sopher. It is also lower than the new US tariffs levied on other countries, such as the 20% tax on the European Union.\n\"Ironically it could be a good thing,\" he says. \"These retailers who would have sourced from Europe might now say 'actually we'll buy more from the UK.\"\nFor something not visible to the naked eye, organic chemicals are a huge US export for the UK, totalling close to \u00a33bn last year.\nThey are used across a massive range of industries from food to make-up to engines and into agriculture.\nRather than feeling fearful about the US tariff, Robinsons Brothers reckons it may help the West Bromwich-based organic chemicals firm wrestle back American customers from cheaper overseas rivals.\nChief executive Adrian Hanrahan says: \"We supplied a lot more to the US but China and India knocked us out of that because of very low pricing.\"\nUnder Trump's new regime, China's imports face a 34% tariff while India's products will be taxed at 27%. Robinsons Brothers chemicals are already taxed at 6% when they reach the US \nMr Hanrahan says he is still trying to nail down whether the new 10% US tariff on UK goods means Robinsons Brothers' American customers will be paying an additional 4% or a total 16%.\n\"Either way, it is a lot less than China or India will see going into the US,\" he says. \"So I am really hoping and seeing an opportunity for us here in one area.\" \nHe says that since January, the company has been receiving more enquiries from the US, including two customers Robinsons Brothers lost five years ago \"at great expense\".\nAt the moment, Robinsons Brothers derives between 1.5% and 2% of total sales - which reached \u00a324m last year - from America. \nThis \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.\nThere are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.\nMr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.\"\nUK exports to the US linked to aircraft totalled \u00a32.2bn in 2024, official figures show.\nDPS Designs contributes a small - but important part - to that industry. The Forest of Dean-based firm makes metal moulds that are used to create plastic sections of airplane seats.\nThe US is DPS's biggest growth market. Around \u00a3150,000 worth of sales come directly from the US out of a total \u00a33m.  \nThe company's managing director of engineering, Sebastian Down, says the firm will negotiate with its customers \"to see if we can share in the pain\" of the new 10% tariffs - once he deciphers what they apply to.\n\"The amount of detail is paper-thin,\" he said.\nDPS Designs has already had to grapple with the ambiguous language used by the White House around tariffs, after Trump announced 25% trade tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US. The company uses aluminium to make its moulds.\n\"There was no-one you could speak to so it relied on me going onto the US department of whatever website, trying to look at lots of detail that basically didn't exist,\" he says.\nUltimately, the aluminium tariff does not apply to his business. But the new 10% tariff criteria isn't clear either. Does it, for example, apply to parts that make up a product or only to the finished article itself? \n\"It is as clear as mud,\" says Mr Down. \nThe US market for British-made cars is of enormous consequence for the UK economy. Last year, the UK exported \u00a39bn worth to America. \nThe sector was already reeling from Trump's previously announced 25% US tariff on cars and light vehicles.  \nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, says: \"These tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting US consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic British brands.\"\nWith Trump's announcement on Wednesday of 10% US taxes on nearly all UK imports, the net will now widen to include the likes of electric motorcycle-maker Maeving.\nSeb Inglis-Jones, co-founder and co-chief executive of the Coventry company, says that sales from the US are \"ever evolving\". Last month, for example, 68% of sales came from America though typically, the US makes up about 40% of its \u00a36m annual turnover.\nMr Inglis-Jones says that the US has helped counterbalance a less-than-optimistic economic outlook in Maeving's other key markets such as the UK, France and Germany.\n\"In the US, there's just more disposable income and so with a slightly more discretionary purchase like ours, a slightly more expensive British built electric motorcycle, Americans are just way more able to spend that money.\"\nHe says that Maeving recently raised prices in the US, not as a pre-emptive move before tariffs but because the cost of doing business in the States had increased.\nWill the company now lift prices again?\n\"We haven't got that far,\" says Mr Inglis-Jones. \"I think we care more about, as a young EV [electric vehicle] company, about the growth and making sure the price is right for the US customer.\n\"If we can't stomach it, we will have to put the prices up again.\"",

But it goes all the way to the White House.\"\nThe 23-year-old was out knocking doors in a quiet residential area on the outskirts of Milwaukee on Monday, a day before voters were set to cast their ballots. \nShe was here with Bloc - Black Leaders Organising for Communities -\u00a0 encouraging people to vote.\nThese kinds of special elections typically see low voter turnout. But Musk's involvement has supercharged emotions on all sides. \nGroups like Bloc put in extra time to engage with voters.\nNot everyone opened their front door on Monday, but some of those who did told Ms Mallet they had already voted. By Monday, some 644,000 people had cast ballots early, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\"I hate Musk! I hate his guts!\" Peggy, standing at her door, said. She didn't want to give the BBC her full name, but described herself as an independent voter who has soured on the Republican Party.\n\"I think Musk bought the presidency,\" she said, in reference to the quarter-of-a-billion dollars that Musk spent in support of Trump's presidential campaign. \n\"And so I think he's trying to buy the election here,\" Peggy continued. \"And I am hoping that people are starting to wake up.\"\nDemocrats, too, have rallied deep-pocketed donors in support of Crawford. Along with Soros, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman have reportedly contributed large sums. But their names haven't inspired the same vitriol as Musk's.\nAnother resident - who gave his name as Palman - said he had already voted, in part as a reaction to Musk.\n\"When you're a billionaire, you don't spend money for no reason,\" he said. \"He's just spending it with purpose.\"\nOn Sunday, Musk hosted a rally where he handed out two $1m cheques to voters who had signed a petition to stop \"activist\" judges who might disrupt Trump's plans. \nWe drove about a half-hour outside of Milwaukee to Waukesha - a swing county that President Trump won. Around 100 people were gathered at the Dockhaus brewery and restaurant overlooking a baseball park, where Schimel made a campaign stop.\nConor Gunar was wearing a red shirt with Musk's name on it.\n\"I'm a big fan,\" he said, clutching his beer. \"He is doing a fantastic job with Doge.\"\n\"Why not?\" he added when asked about Musk's involvement in the race. \"Democrats have people like George Soros and JB Pritzker; why can't we have billionaires?\"\nAnother Schimel supporter, Scarlett Johnson, agreed.\nShe was at Musk's town hall-style event over the weekend, which she described as \"great fun\".\nBut she said she also understood the criticism.\n\"Look, I think it would be great if no billionaires were involved at all, but if they're going to be as they have for Democrats, it's only fair they're involved for Republicans.\"\nOn the left, strategists see a glimmer of light as they search for a clear political strategy. \nDrive down the roads, and you can see billboards plastered in cities like Green Bay and Madison that read \"don't let Elon buy our court\" and depict the SpaceX and Tesla boss as a puppeteer. \nSwitch on the TV and you'll see attack ads that say: \"Elon Musk is out of control.\"\nGoing after Musk instead of Trump seems to be a strategic option for Democrats. \nA poll by Marquette Law School suggests Musk is viewed unfavorably by 53% of registered voters here. \nDriving in his car across rural Wisconsin, Ben Wickler, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, told the BBC that if Crawford could beat Schimel, \"there'll be a very clear kind of game plan for how to fight back against the world's richest man trying to destroy American democracy\".\nAllison Prasch, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specialises in US political rhetoric, said this race was a strategy test for both sides.\n\"We know that Wisconsin, up to the very end of the presidential cycle, was very close,\" she said, noting that some cities such as Milwaukee and Madison unexpectedly swung towards Trump and helped deliver him the state's electoral college votes.\n\"What happens in Wisconsin [now] is going to tell us a lot about what's going to happen, not just in 2026 but in 2028.\"\nMusk's critics say he has practical reasons to care about the Wisconsin race.\nThey point to an ongoing case involving Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company, that could head to the state's supreme court in the future. \nThe billionaire is suing because Wisconsin bans car manufacturers from owning dealerships, but Tesla's business model involves running its own showrooms.\nThe BBC has contacted Musk's America PAC for comment.\nWisconsin Republican strategist Matt Terrill said Musk was allowed to donate to campaigns for things he personally cared about, like any other citizen might - including the Democratic donors heavily backing Crawford.\n\"Musk has obviously got his views from a political standpoint of what he as an American citizen wants to see happen, not just as someone who's a part of the Trump administration,\" said Terrill. \nThe result won't just be a referendum on Trump's presidency so far, but will test Musk's reputation as a kingmaker in American politics.",

I hope you enjoy them.\"\nThe music will be revealed on a box set of seven CDs (or nine vinyl discs), titled Tracks II: The Lost Albums.\nThe scale of the release is quite different from its predecessor, Tracks, whose four discs collected random off-cuts and b-sides from the first 25 years of Springsteen's career.\nAccording to a press release, Tracks II will feature 83 songs, of which 74 have never been officially released in any form.\nMany of the tracks, including Fugitive's Dream and Don't Back Down on Our Love, have circulated on bootlegs for years, but will finally be heard in studio quality. \nSpringsteen said the release had been made possible when the Covid-19 pandemic allowed him to \"finish everything I had in my vault\".\nFans have known for years that Springsteen's vault contains hours and hours of unheard material. \nSpeaking to Variety magazine in 2017, the star admitted: \"We've made many more records than we released. Why didn't we release those records? I didn't think they were essential. \n\"I might have thought they were good, I might have had fun making them... but over my entire work life, I felt like I released what was essential at a certain moment, and what I got in return was a very sharp definition of who I was, what I want to do, what I was singing about. \n\"And I still basically judge what I'm doing by the same set of rules.\"\nIn a video trailer for Tracks II, Springsteen added: \"I often read about myself in the '90s as having some lost period or something. \n\"And I really, really was working the whole time.\"\n\nFans will finally get to hear those \"lost\" songs in June. \nSpringsteen said they would offer a glimpse into the home recordings he made after the commercial success of Born To Run and Born In The USA freed him from the pressure of using commercial recording studios.\n\"The ability to record at home whenever I wanted allowed me to go into a wide variety of different musical directions,\" he said in a statement. \nThat includes the \"sonic experimeentation\" of Faithless, a film soundtrack to a movie that never got made.\nOther unreleased albums include the country-leaning Somewhere North of Nashville, cut in May 1995; and Twilight Hours, an orchestrated pop album that was written and recorded in the same period as 2018's Western Stars.\nThere are also the \"richly-woven border tales\" of Inyo, whose song titles - including The Aztec Dance and Ciudad Juarez - suggest a Latin American influence.\nSpringsteen described the last disc, Perfect World, as \"the one thing on this that wasn't initially conceived as an album\", instead highlighting several songs he wrote with longtime collaborator Joe Grushecky in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nAs a first taste of the collection, he released Rain In The River, from Perfect World, whose muscular drums and squalling feedback showcase the raw power of his regular backing band E Street Band.\n\nThe announcement comes a month before Springsteen kicks off his European tour, with dates in Manchester, Liverpool, Marseille, Berlin and Prague, amongst others.\nThe 75-year-old recently vowed to keep playing live \"until the wheels come off\", but said he had scaled back his tours after his wife, Patti Scialfa, was diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer.",

        "article_text": "Some 68 years ago today, millions of people tuned into a BBC Panorama report about a Swiss family harvesting spaghetti from trees.\nIt may sound implausible, but many viewers believed it.\nWatch the grainy black-and-white footage today and you almost forget everything you know about Italian cuisine for a moment.\nThe actors \"harvesting\" spaghetti strands give committed performances, and the late Richard Dimbleby's deadpan narration lends an air of authenticity to the report.\nIt was, of course, an April Fool's Day joke.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, spaghetti is made from wheat and water. It does not grow on trees.\nBut spaghetti was not a common dish in the UK at the time, so you can see why some may have taken it seriously.\nThis vintage Panorama report is part of what became a tradition in the UK press. \nEvery year on 1 April, newspapers would publish outlandish stories with zero or very little basis in fact, all to have a bit of fun with their readers.\nThe Guardian ran an entire pull-out guide to the fictional Indian Ocean island of \"San Serriffe\" in the 1970s. Its name is a pun on the sans serif group of typefaces, and the island was depicted as being shaped like a semi-colon.\nTen years ago, April Fool's stories in the newspapers were so prevalent that the BBC published this roundup of them.\nMany focused on the looming 2015 general election, with the Sun's election website saying then-Labour leader Ed Miliband had dyed his hair blond in a \"desperate bid for the BoJo [Boris Johnson] factor\".\nIt is unclear whether the move would have swayed the election had this story been true.\nThe Scottish independence referendum was the focus on 1 April 2014, with the Daily Express, the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Guardian all publishing prank stories that year.\nThe Guardian, for example, said an independent Scotland would switch to driving on the right.\nReading through the papers today, you might find one or two April Fool's Day stories. But they do not have the same presence they once had.\nThe rise of social media has ushered in a \"different kind of relationship\" between readers and the press, says Stuart Allan, professor of journalism and communication at Cardiff University.\n\"We are enmeshed in an era of 'fake news' and disinformation, where matters of trust are at the forefront of editors' minds,\" he tells the BBC.\nThe decline of April Fool's Day news stories comes against \"a backdrop of growing scepticism about news in general,\" Prof Allan adds, \"where playing with journalistic credibility may actually prove damaging\".\nJim Waterson, who edits news outlet London Centric, agrees.\n\"Publishing fake news to purposefully trick readers and then saying it's all a joke doesn't really work well when you spend the rest of the year banging on about how much trusted facts matter,\" he says.\n\"But the biggest crime against journalism is that very few newspaper April Fool's stories are remotely funny.\"\nThe global political climate, with Donald Trump's re-election to the US presidency, has also had an impact.\n\"If you've got world leaders who are only too happy to dismiss anything factual they don't like as 'fake news', why would you give them the ammunition of literal fake news?\" Mr Waterson asks.\nSocial media also makes it easy to take a news story out of context.\nPeople used to read their news in a newspaper. They'd be aware, on 1 April, that all of the news stories were published that day. The tell-tale date was at the top of the page.\nNow, readers can share online news stories on social media days, months or even years after they were first published.\nMany people share news articles without reading a single word of them, according to a Columbia University study. So are they likely to read the publication date?\nThen there is the rise of generative AI, which has been widely used in the spread of misinformation in recent years.\nIn a world where AI-generated images can appear almost real, the media's role of separating fact from fiction has never been more important.\nApril Fool's stories serve the entertainment function of journalism, but not truth or accuracy, says Dr Bina Ogbebor, a lecturer in journalism studies at Sheffield University.\nIn some cases, these stories could \"backfire\", make some readers angry, and hamper a media organisation's credibility, she tells the BBC. \n\"It's still something that makes people laugh,\" she says, adding she thinks news websites should add very clear disclaimers if they do choose to run them.\nThough news publishers have taken a step back, the April Fool's tradition is alive and well on social media. But it is brands, not broadcasters, that are leading the charge.\nEach year, many of them post announcements for new products or promotions that are slightly too ridiculous to be genuine. \nTesco once announced it would be trialling trampoline-inspired bouncy aisles in its supermarkets.\nBut brands could find themselves in hot water for playing tricks on newspapers without letting them in on the joke.\nIn late March 2021, Volkswagen claimed it was changing its name to \"Voltswagen\" in a nod to electric vehicles. \nDozens of publications had to publish corrections when it was revealed to have been an April Fool's prank sent to the media early.\nBased on current trends, it is unlikely we will see an April Fool's hoax on the scale of Panorama's spaghetti report any time soon.\n\"The Spaghetti Harvest story of 1957 landed with such a splash because of the very limited news brand choice in those days,\" says Richard Thomas, media professor at Swansea University.\nThanks to the wider range of news sources available instantly on the internet, \"the joke is dead before it even takes its first breath\", he adds.\n\"So the days when the country's most trusted broadcaster and news source can playfully tease its audience on such a scale that we are remembering it almost 70 years later are over. \n\"And - all sentiments about how news should be honest and truthful aside - in a world where happy news is often at a premium, that does seem a shame, somehow.\"\nAdditional reporting by Grace Dean.",

        "article_text": "Ben McKinney has scored 634 runs at an average of 37.29 in 11 first-class matches\nBen McKinney has already had a brush with celebrity.\nDuring series one of Netflix's fly-on-the-wall documentary Sunderland 'Til I Die, he is shown celebrating a rare goal in a season most Black Cats supporters would rather forget.\n\"I got a message from one of my schoolmates saying they had seen me,\" McKinney tells BBC Sport.\n\"It summed the season up that it was just me and my dad because no-one else wanted to come any more.\"\nSix years on, 20-year-old McKinney looks ready start his own journey, one he hopes will have a happier ending.\nHaving made his debut for Durham aged 18 in 2023 and scored his first first-class hundred a year later, the opening batter was already seen as someone with a big future.\nScoring 110 runs from 110 balls for England Lions this winter against an Australia A side featuring six full internationals confirmed it.\n\"It was pretty surreal,\" McKinney says. \"In the moment you are just doing it off instinct.\n\"It is good, coming up against good players, to know you are worthy of playing at the standard.\"\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nStokes to miss early rounds of Championship season\nEngland's hierarchy have shown they are not afraid of giving inexperienced youngsters a chance and they are known to like what they see in McKinney.\nFormer spinner Graeme Swann, part of the Lions set-up with McKinney in Australia, said the left-hander could \"easily walk into Test cricket now\", comparing him to New Zealand great Stephen Fleming.\nHe is a former England Under-19 captain, stands at 6ft 7in and falls into the Bazball mould as an aggressive batter.\nIt leaves those in the know thinking McKinney could follow where Jacob Bethell, Shoaib Bashir and Josh Hull have gone before in being given an early international bow.\n\"You say it's a bit of pressure but you would rather that than no-one speaking about you, wouldn't you?\" McKinney says.\n\"Runs are your currency. I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "Standing in front of a few dozen supporters in a strip-mall parking lot in Ocala, Florida, on Monday evening, Democratic congressional candidate Josh Weil made a prediction. \nThe public school maths teacher said that in less than 24 hours, he was going to make history by flipping a solidly Republican congressional seat \u2013 helping to wrest control of the House of Representatives from the Republicans.\n\"Their 2025 agenda stops here,\" he promised, railing against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to slash government services and personnel.\nJust an hour earlier, in a telephone town hall meeting, Randy Fine, his Republican opponent in Tuesday's special election, had a similar message \u2013 although he framed it as a warning, not a promise.\n\"Democrats are mad,\" he said. \"They're going to do whatever it takes to grind Donald Trump's agenda to a halt.\"\nVoters in the eastern half of central Florida, from Ocala to the towns north of Daytona Beach, head to the polls to fill the seat vacated by Michael Waltz, chosen by Trump to be national security advisor. Waltz recently sparked a media frenzy after inadvertently adding a prominent journalist to a high-level group chat about the US strikes in Yemen. \nThat Waltz's job may now be in jeopardy is just one reason Tuesday's contest for one of the 435 House seats is now a national story.\nThe other is that Weil, despite running in a district Trump carried by more than 30 points last November, just might win. And if he does, Democrats would take a big step closer to a majority in the narrowly divided House.\nWin or lose, the race also could serve as a barometer of voters' motivation as Trump begins his second term \u2013 and offer hints at the political landscape ahead of next year's mid-term congressional elections.\nIt is one of two special elections in Florida on Tuesday. The other, in Florida's panhandle region, will determine a replacement for Matt Gaetz, the firebrand congressman Trump originally picked to be attorney general before he withdrew  under a cloud of sexual misconduct and ethics allegations. A Republican is widely expected to win there.\nBut that is not the case here. Weil has raised about $10m in campaign donations, dwarfing the $1m brought in by Fine, a Florida state senator.\nAccording to a recent public opinion survey, Weil narrowly trails Fine. An internal poll by a respected Republican firm reportedly showed Weil ahead by 3.\nThat's enough to cause more than a little anxiety in Republican ranks.\n\"There's no excuse for a Republican not to win this race,\" said Randy Ross, a Florida-based conservative activist who campaigned there for Trump in 2016 and 2024. \"The only excuse that can possibly be had is Republicans weren't excited and didn't get out to vote.\"\nMr Ross added that Republican voters need to understand that Fine will support Trump's agenda in Congress \u2013 and Weil will not.\nTo this end, some of the party's heaviest hitters stepped in to help. Last Thursday, Trump joined the Republican candidate in two telephone town hall events. On Monday night, Florida Congressman Byron Donalds and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro held their own event.\n\"Donald Trump's agenda is hanging by a thread,\" Shapiro said. \"This is a district that simply cannot fall into Democratic hands.\"\nTech multi-billionaire Musk, a close Trump ally, may be campaigning in person for a hotly contested Wisconsin Supreme Court race, but his political committee directed more than $75,000 to support Fine in recent days. Other conservative groups followed suit, helping Fine level the financial playing field.\nOf particular concern for the party is that special elections take place during times of lower political engagement and usually involve only the one race in question. They often tilt toward the party with the most enthusiasm, according to Mr Ross. For Republicans, a Democratic show of strength on Tuesday would be troubling.\n\"You can't go just on name recognition in a special election,\" he said. \"You've got to drive people out to vote for you.\"\nRepublican nervousness is a result of simple math in the House of Representatives. With a 218 to 213 majority in the 435 seat chamber, the party cannot afford to lose any winnable elections \u2013 let alone ones that should be a slam dunk. \nWhile a Weil victory alone wouldn't be enough to flip control of the chamber, two of the currently vacant seats are in safely Democratic districts. If the results of those special elections go as expected, Democrats would be on the verge of control.\nThat could explain why the president announced on Friday he was withdrawing his pick of New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be US ambassador to the United Nations, despite her having all but formally vacated her office. A Weil victory on Tuesday would mean the Republicans could not afford to lose a New York election to replace Stefanik.\nEven before Tuesday's balloting, both Democrats and Republicans jockeyed to frame the results in the best light for their party.\nConservatives downplayed the national implications of the race and placed blame on Fine, who has been accused of running a lacklustre campaign and taking victory for granted.\n\"It's a reflection of the candidate that's running the race, \" Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said of Fine's apparent underperformance.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are declaring a victory \u2013 at least, the moral variety.\n\"These are races that should not, under ordinary circumstances, be on anyone's political radar,\" Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said last Monday. \"The American people are not buying what the Republicans are selling.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by many of Weil's supporters on Monday night in Ocala, even if the candidate himself told the BBC he would win by eight points.\n\"If we lose but come close, moderate Republicans might take notice,\" said Buddy Oswald, an attorney and educator. If they were worried their party could lose a safe seat, he added, maybe they would feel the heat and be more willing to break with the president.\nEight years ago, in the aftermath of Trump's stunning 2016 presidential victory, Democrats sought solace in special election races across the map. They pulled off some stunners, including a Doug Jones Senate victory in deeply conservative Alabama. In other races, such as a bid by Jon Ossoff in a suburban Atlanta district, the Democrat came up just short.\nThose races presaged a high level of Democratic enthusiasm that led to a wave in the mid-terms the following year, when the party won 39 seats in taking back the House of Representatives and putting a decisive end to Trump's first-term legislative agenda.\nRepublicans, with convincing victories on Tuesday, want to squelch any chance of history repeating itself.\nDemocrats, engaged in a sometimes acrimonious debate over strategy and political priorities, would like Florida to get them back in the win column \u2013 or at least give them hope of better days to come.",

        "article_text": "Heathrow Airport was warned about the \"resilience\" of its power supply in the days before a fire which shut down the airport for more than a day last month.\nNigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators' Committee, a group representing airlines, told MPs on Wednesday that he spoke to Heathrow twice in the week before the closure on 21 March.\nHe questioned why the airport was closed as long as it was and why it was not more prepared considering its importance.\nHowever, Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye called the fire an \"unlikely event\" and defended the length of the closure, saying he had to make \"very serious safety decisions\".\nMr Woldbye apologised to the more than 300,000 passengers whose journeys were disrupted.\nHe offered his \"deepest regrets\" adding that the \"situation was unprecedented\". The airport was shutdown after a fire at an electrical substation.\nThe chaos at Heathrow has raised concerns about the reliability of the major transport hub - and brought into question the UK's energy resilience more broadly.\nSpeaking to MPs on the transport committee, Mr Wicking said he raised cases of \"theft of wire and cable around some of the power supply\" which he said temporarily took out runway lights, which are critical to passenger safety.\n\"I wanted to understand better the overall resilience of the airport.\"\nHe said he had spoken to the Team Heathrow director on 15 March about his concerns - six days before the fire - and the chief operating officer and chief customer officer on 19 March - two days before the fire.\nMr Woldbye said the airport had to rely on contracts it has with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks for making the network resilient, and to improve that \"comes at a very high cost\", which would raise costs for airlines, and passengers.\nHowever, Mr Wicking said Heathrow is \"already the most expensive airport in the world\". \n\"From an airline perspective, we expect resilience, we expect there to be the capability there and the understanding of when a power supply or an asset is not available, what will you do next, and how quickly will you bring it back?\"\nOn the day of the shutdown, airlines had to divert 120 aircraft, which is \"not a light decision to be made in any context\", Mr Wicking added.\nAs a consequence, when Mr Wicking joined a call with NATs, the national air traffic service, at 05:30, \"they'd run out of space within the UK for aircraft to divert\".\n\"Aircraft were then going to Europe, and then some were even halfway across Europe and going back to base in India,\" he said. \"So, quite a level of disruption for those passengers, let alone all of the cancellations\".\nThere were 1,300 cancelled flights, he said.\nThe airport reopened on the Saturday following the fire.\nWhen asked why it had not reopened sooner, Mr Woldbye said that could have meant passengers got hurt.\nHe said: \"If we had got this wrong, we might be sitting here today having a very different discussion about why people got injured, and I think it would have been a much more serious discussion.\n\"So there is a margin within which our people have to take very serious safety decisions, and that is what they are trained for, that is what they do, and that requires that every single system is up and running, tested and safe.\"\nHowever, Mr Wicking said Terminal 5 could have reopened sooner.\nHe said: \"In terms of T5, my understanding both from British Airways but also on the day, was that pretty much everything was fine to operate by mid-morning, by 10 o'clock.\"\nAfter the substation fire began on the Thursday night, Mr Woldbye said Heathrow realised \"during the early hours\" of Friday 21 March that \"we were losing power to the airport\".\n\"In our operations centre you would seen all the red lights go, that the systems were powering down,\" he said. \"We had no information as to why.\"\n\"We then had a slightly later stage call from the fire department that the substation was on fire,\" he said.\nHeathrow is supplied by three substations, but knocking out one caused the airport to shut down.\nMr Woldbye said a third of the airport was powering down and that Terminal 2 was particularly affected, along with certain central systems.

defeats.\nClermont booked their place in the knockout stages by snatching a dramatic 33-26 victory in the sixth minute of overtime to qualify at Bath and Bristol's expense.\nElsewhere, Sale Sharks

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nWatch \"How to Win the Champions League: Liverpool\" on iPlayer now\nA meeting is about to take place at Liverpool and the subject will be Mohamed Salah.\nOn one side you have those providing data and video evidence that Salah is the right signing. On the other side is former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\"Jurgen's preferred option for that summer was Julian Brandt, who was a great player,\" said former Liverpool director of research Ian Graham, who spoke to BBC Sport as part of a documentary released on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the 2018-19 Champions League.\n\"Jurgen had obviously known him very well, coming from the Bundesliga, and knew the German market very well.\n\"We agreed that Brandt was a very good young player but not a standout in the same way that Mo was. From our data analysis point of view Mo was the best young wide forward in Europe, full stop.\n\"Roma were under pressure to sell because their finances were not in a good place, so we knew he was available for a good price.\n\"He played a forward and wide role that we needed to fill at the time, whereas Brandt was more of an attacking midfielder.\"\nGraham added: \"It's to Jurgen's credit that he engaged in that debate in an honest way with his eyes open to say, 'OK, I'm open to be convinced, show me that Mo is better'.\"\nKlopp didn't need much convincing and Liverpool signed Salah from Roma in June 2017 for \u00a334m.\nThe Reds believed the Egypt international would be a \"future superstar\" and so it has proved.\nSalah, who is yet to agree a new contract with Liverpool beyond this summer, has gone on to become a Liverpool legend. \nHe has scored 243 goals and registered 109 assists for the club in 393 appearances and, under Klopp, helped the Reds win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Fifa Club World Cup.\nHow to Win the Champions League\nLiverpool\nGraham was a consultant at Tottenham from 2007-2012 but \"they never really had the ambition to make more\" of data whereas he said \"Liverpool were the first team to have an in-house analytics department\".\nHe was at Liverpool from 2012 to 2023 and was a key part of the 'Moneyball' strategy - the statistical method Major League \u00adBaseball side Oakland Athletics used in the 1990s to recruit players - that Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) adopted at the club.\n\"Moneyball is really the concept of, 'can we get more value for money out of our squad? Can we get more performance per pound spent? Because, if we can, that means we can compete with clubs with a higher budget than us',\" said Graham.\n\"We started off with about seven or eight different leagues, by the time I left we were probably taking data from about 60 different leagues so that we really understood what players could do on the pitch.\"\nGraham worked under former Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards, who left the club in 2022 before returning as FSG's chief executive of football in 2024.\nThe pair were part of a transfer committee who, along with Liverpool's manager, would \"come to a consensus decision on the best players to sign\".\nLiverpool had appointed Klopp as manager in October 2015 and his willingness to engage in the use of data in recruitment was in contrast to his predecessor Brendan Rodgers.\n\"Previously, we had robust debates with Brendan about which players to sign and the two differences were our ideas about which players would improve Liverpool were very different to Brendan's ideas,\" said Graham.\n\"Brendan, understandably, put a big premium on Premier League experience whereas we felt those players were quite often overvalued by the market and players from other markets, like Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino, were undervalued.\"\nGraham explained that Rodgers \"came in with a preconception that the player he wanted to sign was the only solution for that position\" and that \"it was very difficult to persuade him otherwise\".\nIn Klopp, Graham said they had found the \"missing piece\" and, in some cases, \"a manager who seemed to see what the data saw\".\nHe added: \"He [Jurgen] is very happy to thank us for our suggestions to have stopped some of the less sensible signings, which at the time caused big arguments but, in retrospect, he could see this was a good process for signing players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHow Jurgen Klopp almost didn't sign Salah\nKlopp had managed at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund in Germany, winning the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012 with the latter.\nHis first trophy at Liverpool was the 2019 Champions League, with data playing \"a big part in signing\" nine of the 11 Liverpool players who started the final against Tottenham - in a game the Reds won 2-0.\n\"The club needed it and, from our point of view, the data approach needed it as well,\" said Graham on that piece of silverware.\n\"Looking back, it is a source of pride and is some validation that data can be of help. It adds to recruitment.\n\"Our data analysis means nothing without the scouts to understand the traditional way of viewing a player, without Jurgen to get the best out of the players, without the ownership to trust in the process and without the sporting director to make decisions based on what the data is telling him.\n\"Jurgen's impact on the Champions League win, it can't really be overstated. His presence at the club attracted some really great players, he got the best out of those players and - by the time of that final - we had a world-class first XI that was quite different to the team that he inherited.\"\nKlopp went on to end the club's 30-year wait for a top-flight title by guiding them to the 2019-20 Premier League crown.\nGraham said: \"Jurgen, coming from the German system, was much more happy to take that compromised approach and it worked out really well for Liverpool.\"\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

Fitness is a non-negotiable. We should be fit.\"\nAfter England's early exit from the T20 World Cup in October, former spinner Alex Hartley said some players were \"letting the team down\" in terms of fitness.\nAthleticism again came into focus during the Ashes clean sweep, but Lewis attributed that to a cultural difference between the UK and Australia.\nThe Lewis regime was also characterised by a more relaxed approach. During the World Cup, some England players attended boat parties in Dubai.\n\"Honesty and hard work are key to any culture,\" said Edwards, England's all-time leading run-scorer.\n\"If we've got that in place we will move pretty quickly in the right direction. We've got to work hard. That's for me to implement in training. We will talk to our science and medicine teams in terms of what we have to do with our fitness standards.\"\n'Everyone should be excited by this' - England appoint Edwards as head coach\nKnight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nEdwards won the Ashes and both World Cups as England captain only to be sacked in 2016 and replaced by Knight.\nNow Knight has been sacked but has indicated her desire to continue as a player. Edwards, 45, said she was not consulted in the decision to remove Knight.\n\"She sets such high standards, she's the ultimate professional and what we need around the England team right now,\" said Edwards. \n\"She's playing as well as I've ever seen her play. It was hard to watch the Ashes, because of the toll it was taking on her. Without the captaincy, hopefully she'll be able to go on to bigger and better things as a player.\"\nIn order to take the England job, Edwards has left all of her roles in domestic cricket, including her post as Mumbai Indians head coach in the Women's Premier League. While he was England coach, Lewis was in charge of UP Warriorz in the same competition.\nEngland will appoint a new national selector, as well as a new captain, which Edwards said will be in place for the series against West Indies in May.\nKnight's vice-captain Nat Sciver-Brunt has previously said she would be interested in the job, while off-spinner Charlie Dean admitted she would not turn it down if approached.\nEdwards, who captained England on more than 200 occasions, said she is looking for \"someone who leads from the front in everything they do, someone who has the respect of the current playing group\". She also said England will have one captain, rather than splitting the role across formats.\nCharlotte Edwards played more than 300 times for England in a 19-year career\nEdwards has been appointed after a review into the Ashes led by England director of women's cricket Clare Connor and performance director Jonathan Finch.\nConnor, herself an Ashes-winning England captain, confirmed Edwards was given the job without a formal process.\nIn 2018, the England and Wales Cricket Board pledged to adopt the Rooney Rule - interviewing at least one applicant from black, Asian or minority ethic backgrounds for all coaching roles in its national teams. It was not used for the appointment of Edwards.\n\"In these particular circumstances, with the criteria in front of me, I did not believe an open recruitment process was needed or would have benefited anyone,\" said Connor.\n\"I was very, very clear there was one person in the world of coaching who could have filled this role. Charlotte Edwards is the only person on the planet that can tick every box to the degree that she can.\"\nConnor also opted against bringing in internal or independent leadership for the review. When asked if that was tantamount to Connor and Finch \"marking their own homework\", Connor said: \"I understand that perspective. I'm accountable to the board for England women's cricket. \n\"I'm very confident in the steps we are taking and the way we are setting the team up for success. That is the job I'm paid to do.\n\"I'm under no illusion the buck does stop with me and I'm accountable for the England women's cricket team and how we perform.\"",

        "article_text": "Our lives are surprisingly dependent upon this extremely light and unreactive gas, yet supplies of it are remarkably fragile.\nNancy Washton remembers the sinking feeling she got when she heard her helium delivery wouldn't be arriving. In early 2022, she and her team of chemists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the United States were abruptly told by their supplier that they wouldn't get their usual shipment of the gas, which they use in a range of different experiments.\nShortages meant there wasn't enough to go around, and the laboratory would simply have to make do with less. In the first weeks of that year, the laboratory's supply dropped well below the 2,500 litres (660 gallons) it normally received. By April, just a couple of months later, it was getting less than half the helium it needed.\nWith a small fleet of instruments that require regular top-ups of liquid helium, the lab had no choice but to sacrifice the greediest of these in order to continue running the most important. Washton's own instrument of choice was a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer \u2013 a huge, hulking tower, capable of peering into the molecular structure of atoms. Such measurements can contribute to the development of new batteries and energy storage systems, for example.\nThe spectrometer was the only one of its kind in North America, and less than 12 months after its installation it was providing results that were potentially game-changing. When turned on samples of magnesium oxide, for example, it showed the\u00a0minerals are capable of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.\u00a0Such \"carbon mineralisation\" has long been explored as a way of combatting greenhouse gas emissions, but the results showed how useful these minerals could be.\n\"There had been no definitive evidence of carbonate formations on these particular types of magnesium oxides [before],\" says Washton.\u00a0\"I just could not believe the data. The fact that we had managed to get this data, and the beauty of the story it told, was just amazing,\" Washton says.\nBut then all of that work abruptly had to stop.\nThe rate at which the spectrometer consumed helium made it a problem. In a process Washton later described as \"traumatising\", the instrument was de-energised and mothballed, its experiments suspended. It would sit inert and useless for several months until more helium could be secured. Today, the device is back up and running \u2013 the lab has the helium it needs. For the time being.\nWhat is helium used for?\nHelium is an inert gas, which means that it does not react readily with other substances. It has the lowest boiling point of any element at -269C (-452F) and a low density.\nThe space industry uses helium to keep satellite instruments cool and to clean out rocket engines. It is also used to pressurise the fuel tanks of space rockets.\nHelium also cools equipment within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.\nHelium is often used to fill party balloons, weather balloons and airships due to its low density.\nDeep-sea divers rely on helium to control the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen they get from their breathing apparatus, since this helps to avoid decompression sickness.\nThe episode highlights how vulnerable helium supplies are and why there is now a desperate scramble around the world to find ways of conserving and recycling this crucial gas.\nThe shortages in 2022 didn't just affect researchers. You might not realise it, but many of the products and processes you encounter each day depend on helium.\nHospitals, for example, are the world's largest consumers of helium, accounting for around 32% of the global market. The gas is used to cool magnets in vital diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. Helium is also used in the manufacturing of the semiconductors (computer chips), which are at the heart of electronic devices. It's also used in welding and even pressurises the fuel tanks of rockets that put satellites into orbit. Plus, helium is part of the gas mixture that inflates car safety airbags.\nHelium is odourless, extremely light and, unlike another very light element once used in airships, hydrogen, it will never burst into flames. When cooled, it only condenses into a liquid at the stunningly low temperature of roughly 4.2 Kelvin, or -269C/-452F. Plus, under normal atmospheric conditions, helium will not freeze even at temperatures as low as absolute zero, or 0 Kelvin (-273C/-460F). This makes it incredibly useful.\u00a0\n\"Helium is a magical element,\" says Sophia Hayes, professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis. \"There is nothing else like it in the Universe.\"\nLiquid helium takes on strange properties when it is chilled almost to absolute zero, turning into a superfluid that flows without friction. Stir a cup of superfluid helium and the liquid inside would theoretically keep spinning forever. Superfluid helium has become vital for large-scale superconductors, such as those used by the Large Hadron Collider experiment at Cern on the border between Switzerland and France.\nBut since 2006, helium has repeatedly been in short supply. The most recent extended shortage started in January 2022 before easing the following year. But helium supplies have remained precarious, with producers struggling to keep up with demand.\nThat demand is only expected to rise further \u2013 with some analysts predicting that it will double by 2035 due to helium's key roles in semiconductor and electric vehicle battery manufacturing, as well as in aerospace applications.\nThere are only two sources of helium: the highly-energetic nuclear fusion reactions inside stars, including our Sun, and the slow decay radioactive elements in Earth's crust. Since we can't artificially manufacture helium with today's technology, that means it is essentially a finite resource. Instead, helium is typically mined alongside natural gas by drilling deep wells into the ground, but only a handful of companies across the world currently do this.\nHelium is also a remarkably uncooperative element. The extraction and burning of fossil fuels have caused increasing amounts of helium to build up in the Earth's atmosphere in recent decades, depleting the resource otherwise locked inside our planet.\nBut helium is so light that it is also slowly leaking out of the Earth's atmosphere and heading off into space. In its superfluid state, it has a habit of finding its way out of even the tiniest cracks and holes. It can even flow up walls in this superfluid state. That makes it difficult to handle and store \u2013 it can be easily lost after use.\nAll of this makes the helium supply chain fragile \u2013 resulting in four worldwide helium shortages in the last twenty years alone.\nThe most recent severe shortage in 2022 that scuppered some of Washton's research occurred after a series of fires at a major Russian gas processing plant in the Amur region of Siberia. The war in Ukraine compounded the problem by further choking supplies at the same time a helium plant in Qatar went offline for planned maintenance. Meanwhile, the crude helium enrichment unit at the US National Helium Reserve was shut down during the summer of 2021 and again for four months at the end of January 2022. The US shutdown removed around 10% of the global production capacity of helium from the supply chain. Taken together, these incidents led to a sudden shortage and highlighted just how vulnerable the world's helium supply could be. By 2023, the industrial sale price of helium had nearly doubled from what it was five years before, reaching an all-time high.\nAlthough helium production has since increased, the world yet again faces potential disruption, leaving market prices volatile. In September 2024, the EU began enforcing new sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, including banning imports of helium. While Russia accounts for only 1% of the EU's helium imports, the move marked a further tightening of supplies. On top of that, the sale of the world's largest helium reserve \u2013 the US Federal Helium Reserve \u2013 has triggered further uncertainty.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why the world is running out of sand\n\u2022\u00a0How Google's ballons surprised their creator\n\u2022\u00a0The world's forgotten greenhouse gas\nFor several decades, the US has supplied around one-tenth of the world's helium from an underground federal stockpile established a century ago near Amarillo, Texas. But in June 2024, the Bureau of Land Management, which ran the US helium reserve, sold the last gasp of federal helium to the German gas supplier Messer. Ahead of the handover, the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine released a report warning that the sale of the strategic reserve to a commercial company could heighten uncertainty in the helium market.\u00a0\nTrade bodies including The Compressed Gas Association and the Advanced Medical Technology Association \u2013 AdvaMed \u2013 urged the US government to delay the sale on the grounds that it risked a \"supply chain crisis\". And healthcare contractor Premier Inc, which sources helium on behalf of thousands of hospitals, suggested the sale could have a detrimental impact on patient care.\u00a0\nAlthough these fears are yet to be realised, there are signs that not all is going smoothly.\nWithin months of the sale, Messer was forced to request a temporary restraining order to prevent another shutdown of the crude helium enrichment unit \u2013 this was due to the expiry of a critical lease and a negotiation dispute. The company that ran the enrichment unit was later placed into receivership. Messer, however, says its helium system \"has been operating reliably and without interruption since we acquired it last June, and we anticipate smooth uninterrupted operations in the future\".\nBut a recent analysis of helium supplies suggests that this natural resource is likely to take on growing geopolitical importance over the coming years as demand and competition for the gas increases.\nThe US accounts for about 46% of the global supply of helium, followed by Qatar (38%) and then Algeria (5%). If US supplies were to be disrupted again, the impact would be felt around the world.\nYears of precarious helium supplies and price fluctuations, however, have also forced academic, commercial and clinical bodies to explore more sustainable modes of helium consumption. Firmly in their crosshairs are helium-hungry MRI machines.\nA standard MRI machine requires a little under 2,000 litres of liquid helium to cool its superconducting magnets. Each unit needs occasional top-ups and, without the cooling helium, its magnets would heat up, evaporate the helium reservoir, and expel it in a process called \"quenching\". It's rare, but dire: the helium is lost, and another couple thousand litres of the liquid is required to put the machine back into working order. If a quenching incident causes more serious damage, then the whole MRI machine might need replacing at great expense.\u00a0\nNow, a new breed of MRI machines that require significantly less helium are emerging. Many of these low-helium units need as little as one litre of helium to operate, sealing it in a closed system. In recent years, these machines have already begun appearing in hospitals and research institutions.\u00a0 \u00a0\nBut there are limits. These low-helium scanners are especially expensive, and it would still take many years to replace the more than 35,000 MRI machines that use superconductors worldwide.\nThe new scanners are also only capable of producing magnetic field strengths of around 1.5 Tesla \u2013 roughly half of what their beefier predecessors can put out. \"Higher-field-strength scanners have the potential to scan in finer detail and/or faster than lower-field-strength scanners,\" says Sharon Giles, director of clinical and research imaging operations at King's College London. The use of these low-helium scanners, then, is limited, although Giles says they're still capable of performing routine imaging in a lab setting.\nOther researchers have searched for ways to cut out helium entirely by developing superconducting materials that don't need to be cooled to such extremes.\nMore widely, researchers are starting to shore up their own supplies by recycling. Helium recovery systems can recapture evaporated helium that would otherwise be lost. \"It will allow us to recover about 90% of the helium that we purchase every year,\" says Nicholas Fitzkee, director of Mississippi State University's nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) facility, which is in the process of installing a recovery system. \"We did the calculations when we wrote the proposal and the total cost of the system was just over $300,000 (\u00a3238,000), and it should pay for itself within six years.\"\nBut installing helium recovery technology \u2013 complicated arrangements of pipes, tubing and headers that must be fed through a facility's instruments \u2013 is time-consuming and complex. These systems can fail, leak, and even when done right, Washton worries that some people may not fully appreciate their benefit. \"To make an argument, 'Hey, I need $600,000 (\u00a3476,000) for a couple of helium recovery units', people are like, 'Well, what's that gonna do for us? That's kind of like you're putting in new plumbing',\" she says, explaining that such work doesn't have the \"bling\" factor that helps justify certain other scientific investments.\nBut there may also be some signs of relief on the horizon. Qatar is on course to open a new helium plant by 2027, while other companies have started to look for previously untapped underground fields.\nIn 2016, the world's largest helium reserve was found in Tanzania. It is set to start production in 2025. This was actually the first helium gas field to be discovered deliberately, and the launch of operations there will mark the first time helium has been recovered at scale, rather than as a by-product of polluting natural gas extraction. Major helium reserves have also been discovered in China's Bohai Bay Basin.\nChristopher Ballentine, chair of geochemistry at the University of Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences, contributed to the scientific research that ultimately helped to locate the Tanzanian helium deposit. But he cautions against over-excitement. \"The challenge of finding significant helium deposits to meet the growing global demand requires significant finances and a long lead-in time,\" he says.\nVolatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource is \u2013 and how quickly its supply can be pinched off.\nWashton emphasises the risks: \"Imagine if there's just not enough helium, and your grandma can't get her MRI because its superconductor is dead. This is serious and we need to deal with it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

Because, if we can, that means we can compete with clubs with a higher budget than us',\" said Graham.\n\"We started off with about seven or eight different leagues, by the time I left we were probably taking data from about 60 different leagues so that we really understood what players could do on the pitch.\"\nGraham worked under former Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards, who left the club in 2022 before returning as FSG's chief executive of football in 2024.\nThe pair were part of a transfer committee who, along with Liverpool's manager, would \"come to a consensus decision on the best players to sign\".\nLiverpool had appointed Klopp as manager in October 2015 and his willingness to engage in the use of data in recruitment was in contrast to his predecessor Brendan Rodgers.\n\"Previously, we had robust debates with Brendan about which players to sign and the two differences were our ideas about which players would improve Liverpool were very different to Brendan's ideas,\" said Graham.\n\"Brendan, understandably, put a big premium on Premier League experience whereas we felt those players were quite often overvalued by the market and players from other markets, like Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino, were undervalued.\"\nGraham explained that Rodgers \"came in with a preconception that the player he wanted to sign was the only solution for that position\" and that \"it was very difficult to persuade him otherwise\".\nIn Klopp, Graham said they had found the \"missing piece\" and, in some cases, \"a manager who seemed to see what the data saw\".\nHe added: \"He [Jurgen] is very happy to thank us for our suggestions to have stopped some of the less sensible signings, which at the time caused big arguments but, in retrospect, he could see this was a good process for signing players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHow Jurgen Klopp almost didn't sign Salah\nKlopp had managed at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund in Germany, winning the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012 with the latter.\nHis first trophy at Liverpool was the 2019 Champions League, with data playing \"a big part in signing\" nine of the 11 Liverpool players who started the final against Tottenham - in a game the Reds won 2-0.\n\"The club needed it and, from our point of view, the data approach needed it as well,\" said Graham on that piece of silverware.\n\"Looking back, it is a source of pride and is some validation that data can be of help. It adds to recruitment.\n\"Our data analysis means nothing without the scouts to understand the traditional way of viewing a player, without Jurgen to get the best out of the players, without the ownership to trust in the process and without the sporting director to make decisions based on what the data is telling him.\n\"Jurgen's impact on the Champions League win, it can't really be overstated. His presence at the club attracted some really great players, he got the best out of those players and - by the time of that final - we had a world-class first XI that was quite different to the team that he inherited.\"\nKlopp went on to end the club's 30-year wait for a top-flight title by guiding them to the 2019-20 Premier League crown.\nGraham said: \"Jurgen, coming from the German system, was much more happy to take that compromised approach and it worked out really well for Liverpool.\"\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.\nShe had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time. \nBut in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.\nShe switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.\n\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"\nNow she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773). \nHer shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.\n\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.\nLive shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.\nLive shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters. \nBut live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.\nAlso, as younger generations increasingly cut the chord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.\nIt's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.\nA 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months. \n\nGuillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.\n\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\" \nHe's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.\nHowever, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.\n\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.\n\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds. \nJonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.\n\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.\n\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.\nEven Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.\nFor example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"\nBruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive. \n\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.\nDespite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.\nNordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.\n\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.\n\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"\nFor some brands live shopping has been a game-changer.\nHigh-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US.\nOman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units.\nThe firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want. \n\"In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,\" says Mr Salmon, \"but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products.\"",

        "article_text": "From the return of HBO's zombie apocalypse thriller to Michelle Williams in a provocative new role.\nIn this droll new series, Kevin Bacon adds demon-chasing bounty-hunter to his long list of horror characters. Hub Halloran was a bounty hunter before his murder, but when he lands on the other side, the devil himself gives him a second chance at redemption, reanimating him and sending him back among the living to track down and return demons who have escaped hell. The catch: if he fails at his job he will be called back into the flames forever. In his downtime from hunting demons \u2013 they have piercing yellow pupils, the better to identify them \u2013 he tries to reconcile with his estranged family. The Bondsman is produced by Blumhouse, the company behind such hit horror franchises as The Purge, so there's reason to believe in this show with a cockeyed premise, which manages to throw in country music. \u00a0\nThe Bondsman premieres 3 April on Amazon Prime internationally\nNetflix contributes to the apparently endless stream of soapy medical dramas with this series about students and residents at a Miami trauma hospital. At the centre is Danielle (Willa Fitzgerald) who is appointed chief resident when the previous chief \u2013 inconveniently her ex, Xander (Colin Woodell) \u2013 is suspended. But wait! There's a hurricane on the way, so Xander doesn't leave the hospital and together they thrash out their personal issues in between saving lives. Justina Machado (One Day at a Time) plays their boss, the Chair of Emergency Medicine. The terrific Max series The Pitt has proven how well this creaky genre can work, and that show is about to drop its season finale, so Pulse might fill the gap. Just be prepared for evergreen lines like, \"He's going to code!\" and, \"If you go one millimetre too far, she dies!\"\nPulse premieres 3 April on Netflix internationally\nOne of Michelle Williams' best performances was as Gwen Verdon in the television series Fosse/Verdon, and here she takes on another rich small-screen role as Molly, a woman diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer, who decides to spend her last months on a no-holds-barred journey to indulge herself sexually while there's still time. Jenny Slate plays Nikki, her best friend and wingperson. The series is based on the Wondery podcast created by Nikki Boyer about her friend Molly Kochan, the real-life inspiration for the show. Jay Duplass plays Molly's husband, Sissy Spacek is her mother and Rob Delaney a neighbour in a series that leavens the drama with comedy. Critics have raved about Williams and the show, with the Observer saying \"the series' comedy never strikes a wrong note\", and The Daily Beast calling it \"a near perfect amalgamation of absurdity and tragedy\".\nDying for Sex premieres 4 April on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK and internationally\nFew shows have had the cultural impact of The Handmaid's Tale. Women protestors in real life have marched in red cloaks, referencing the handmaids in the series' misogynistic state of Gilead and symbolising oppression. The show's plot has long since outrun the Margaret Atwood novel it is based on, and in this sixth and final season June (Elisabeth Moss), having escaped to freedom in Canada, leaves and continues fighting with the resistance. The most chilling characters return, with Ann Dowd as Aunt Lydia, Yvonne Strahovski as Serena and Bradley Whitford as Commander Lawrence. This final season will offer \"feel-good episodes\", the series showrunner, Yahlin Chang, told TV Insider. In a recent panel conversation the creators also spoke about this season landing in a political climate that has left them \"bewildered\": \"We need to meet this moment,\" said Whitford. \"Our women are not Marvel characters, they're ordinary women who are doing extraordinary things,\" executive producer Warren Littlefield added, declaring that the show's final message is \"the war is not over, but the fight continues\".\nThe Handmaid's Tale premieres 8 April on Hulu in the US\nJean Smart is beloved by fans for her Emmy-winning role as Deborah Vance, the old-school stand-up comic who has found a career resurgence with the help of her young writer and frenemy, Ava (Hannah Einbinder). As the fourth season starts, Deborah has realised her dream of hosting a late-night talk show, only to have the ruthlessly ambitious Ava blackmail her way into being named head writer. The relationship between Deborah and Ava \u2013 sometimes mentor-mentee, sometimes competitors, sometimes loving and always fraught \u2013 is the heart of the series, but its success rests largely on Smart's perfectly acerbic delivery. Julianne Nicholson is among the season's guest stars in a show that comically and deftly addresses big issues including sexism and aging in the entertainment industry.\u00a0\nHacks premieres 10 April on Max\nSince Charlie Brooker's dystopian sci-fi series started in 2011, the real world has increasingly caught up to the show, with the mainstream use of artificial intelligence being just the most conspicuous example. The seventh season of the anthology includes, unusually, a sequel. It returns to USS Callister, the show's classic Star Trek homage, with Cristin Milioti (The Penguin) as a computer programmer who finds herself cloned inside a video game. \"Normally I kill off characters at the end of an episode, [but] I kept some of them alive. I'm growing as a human,\" Brooker has said. The other five episodes are crammed with well-known faces, as its zealous fans have come to expect. They include Awkwafina, Paul Giamatti, Emma Corrin, Will Poulter, Peter Capaldi, Issa Rae, Chris O'Dowd, Tracee Ellis Ross and Rashida Jones. Text in the trailer flashes the words, \"Lose Your Mind. Lose Your Reality.\" Let's hope those words don't come back to haunt us in real life, but then Brooker has a way of being just a step ahead.\nBlack Mirror premieres 10 April on Netflix internationally\nJon Hamm has had some great, attention-getting supporting roles since Mad Men, including the bullying, corrupt sheriff in the most recent season of Fargo and the slick gazillionaire in The Morning Show. But he is once again the main character in this comic drama about Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a rich hedge-fund manager who loses his job and sees his privileged life and identity slipping away. Struggling to keep up appearances and support his ex-wife and their teenaged children, he resorts to stealing jewels, designer bags and other valuables from his friends. Amanda Peet plays his ex-wife, who left him for one of his best friends, and Olivia Munn is his on-and-off fling. The show was created by novelist and screenwriter Jonathan Tropper (This is Where I Leave You). Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) directed the first two episodes of this vibrant series which, in good news, has already been ordered for a second season.\nYour Friends and Neighbors premieres 11 April on Apple TV+ internationally\nOne of the best, most gripping shows of recent years returns for its second season of people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. The story picks up five years after the previous season ended, but Joel \u2013 Pedro Pascal in his breakthrough role \u2013 and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are now estranged, creating a new dynamic. That's just one change. There will be a new variant of the infected creatures, smarter and more lethal than the old breed. Kaitlyn Dever (Apple Cider Vinegar) joins the cast as soldier Abby, already causing much online chatter because Dever is physically slighter than the character in the video game the series is based on. And Catherine O'Hara takes on a dramatic role as Joel's therapist, because who wouldn't need one after everything he's been through? Pascal, who gives Joel such fierce energy, told Empire magazine that the new season \"further tests our strength against a world we're already afraid to be in\".\nThe Last of Us premieres 13 April on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK\nDavid Oyelowo, last seen on television as a 19th-Century US Marshal in Lawman: Bass Reeves, heads to the 20th Century in this surreal comedy and redemption story set in 1969 California. He plays Hampton Chambers, recently released from prison where he was serving time for burglary. He is determined to regain the confidence of his wife and two grown sons, and change the family fortunes by inventing a self-sharpening drill called Bit Magician. Those fortunes are floundering if the title is a clue. Government cheese refers to the bricks of processed cheese the US government once distributed to people who qualified for food assistance. Oyelowo was drawn to the show's most surreal aspect, Hampton's spiritual quest, telling Variety his character has \"this weird interaction with God, where he has a very direct relationship to the point whereby miracles, the likes of which we see in the Bible, are manifesting in his life\".\nGovernment Cheese premieres 16 April on Apple TV+ internationally\nThe much-anticipated second season of this prequel to the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) concludes the backstory of Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), and his journey from scrappy thief to fighter in the Rebel Alliance, and the heroic figure he is in the film. The many movie spin-off series on Disney+ have been up and down, but there is wide agreement that Andor is one of the best. In a representative view, Vulture's headline for its first season review said, \"Andor is the Cure for Star Wars Ennui\", and went on to call it \"the most challenging and invigorating work in this galaxy in years\". Tony Gilroy, the series' creator, returns for the final go-round, along with a cast that includes Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Ben Mendelsohn, Forest Whitaker and plenty of Stormtroopers. Disney+ has given the new season a big, confident push by making the first available on Hulu and YouTube.\nAndor premieres 22 April in the US and 23 April in the UK on Disney+\nAmy Sherman-Palladino has created two wildly popular shows, Gilmore Girls and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. But her latest echoes her lesser-known, wonderful Bunheads (2012), with Sutton Foster as a Las Vegas showgirl turned small-town ballet teacher. That show only lasted a season, but has since been embraced by a cult of fans. \u00c9toile is a comic drama with a bigger dance-world canvas, as ballet companies in New York and Paris decide to trade their star dancers in an effort to shore up their flagging institutions. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the head of the Paris company and Luke Kirby (Lenny Bruce in Mrs. Maisel) the head of the New York troupe. The cast also includes Simon Callow and Lou de La\u00e2ge, along with dancers from the New York City Ballet and Boston Ballet. As always, a Sherman-Palladino show promises both comic mayhem and sharp dialogue.\n\u00c9toile premieres 24 April on Amazon Prime internationally\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\n\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

It comes after a judge had denied his request to delay his deportation.\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on international students who have been active in protests against Israel on university campuses. \nMr Taal is at least the second international student to opt to leave the US after being targeted for removal by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Trump administration identifies these cases as \"self-deportations\".\n\"Given what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favourable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety and ability to express my beliefs,\" Mr Taal posted on X on Monday.\n\"I have lost faith I could walk the streets without being abducted. Weighing up these options. I took the decision to leave on my own terms.\"\nA DHS official later confirmed that Mr Taal had departed the US, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\nMr Taal was suspended twice by Cornell, an Ivy League school in upstate New York, due to protest activities. On the day of the Hamas attack against Israel in 2023, he posted: \"Glory to the Resistance.\"\n\"We are in solidarity with the armed resistance in Palestine from the river to the sea,\" he later told a crowd of protesters, according to The Cornell Daily Sun newspaper. \nAt least 300 university students had their student visas revoked due to involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week. \nTrump officials said the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the State Department to deport non-citizens who are \"adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests\" of the US.\nThe arrests are a part of Trump's pledge to combat what the administration has classified as antisemitism, which was written into an executive order in January.\nCritics have decried the deportations as a violation of free speech.\nAnother student who chose to flee the US, Indian scholar Ranjani Srinivasan, told CNN that she wants to clear her name.\n\"I'm not a terrorist sympathiser,\" she told CNN, adding: \"I'm literally just a random student.\"\nShe added that she hopes to re-enrol at Columbia University, which was the epicentre of student protests last year, and finish her PhD programme.",

        "article_text": "Outrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.\nListen to Andrew read this article\nThe airwaves have been throbbing with indignation.\n\"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.\nBut it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Either way, it has created a feverish mood among the nation's politicians.\nLe Pen and her allies have boldly declared that France's institutions, and democracy itself, have been \"executed\", are \"dead\", or \"violated\". The country's justice system has been turned into a \"political\" hit squad, shamelessly intervening in a nation's right to choose its own leaders. And Marine Le Pen has been widely portrayed, with something close to certainty, as France's president-in-waiting, as the nation's most popular politician, cruelly robbed of her near-inevitable procession towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.\nAs France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.\nNervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.\nBut other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.\nAn early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. The poll, produced within hours of the court's ruling, showed less than a third of the country \u2013 31% - felt the decision to block Le Pen, immediately, from running for public office, was unjust. \nTellingly, that figure was less than the 37% of French people who recently expressed an interest in voting for her as president.\nIn other words, plenty of people who like her as a politician also think it reasonable that her crimes should disqualify her from running for office.\nAnd remember, French presidential elections are still two years away \u2013 an eternity in the current political climate.\nEmmanuel Macron is not entitled to stand for another term and no clear alternative to Le Pen, from the left or centre of French politics, has yet emerged. Le Pen's share of the vote has consistently risen during her previous three failed bids for the top job but it is premature, at best, to consider her a shoo-in for 2027.\nAnyone who followed the court case against her and her party colleagues in an impartial fashion would struggle to conclude that the verdicts in Le Pen's case were unreasonable.\nThe evidence of a massive and coordinated project to defraud the European Parliament and its associated taxpayers included jaw-droppingly incriminating emails suggesting officials knew exactly what they were doing, and the illegality of their actions.\nThat the corruption was for the party, not for personal gain, surely changes nothing. Corruption is corruption. Besides, other parties have also been found guilty of similar offences.\nRegarding the punishments handed out by the court, here it seems fair to argue that Le Pen and her party made a strategic blunder in their approach to the case. \nHad they acknowledged the facts, and their errors, and cooperated in facilitating a swift trial rather than helping to drag the process out for almost a decade, the judges \u2013 as they've now made clear \u2013 might have taken their attitude towards the case into consideration when considering punishments.\n\"Neither during the investigation nor at the trial did [Le Pen] show any awareness of the need for probity as an elected official, nor of the ensuing responsibilities,\" wrote the judges in a document explaining, often indignantly, why they'd delivered such a tough sentence.\nThey berated Le Pen for seeking to delay or avoid justice with \"a defence system that disregards the uncovering of the truth\".\nIt is worth noting, here, the wider hypocrisy demonstrated by elites across France's political spectrum who have recently been muttering their sympathy for Le Pen. It is nine years since MPs voted to toughen up the laws on corruption, introducing the very sanctions - on immediately banning criminals from public office - that were used by the judges in this case.\nThat toughening was welcomed by the public as an antidote to a judicial system stymied by an indulgent culture of successive appeals that enabled \u2013 and sometimes still enables - politicians to dodge accountability for decades.\nLe Pen is now being gleefully taunted by her critics online with the many past instances in which she has called for stricter laws on corruption.\n\"When are we going to learn the lessons and effectively introduce lifelong ineligibility for those who have been convicted of acts committed while in office or during their term of office?\" she asked in 2013.\nReasonable people can reasonably disagree about the court's sentencing decisions in Le Pen's case. But the notion \u2013 enthusiastically endorsed by populist and hard-right politicians across Europe and the US \u2013 that she is a victim of a conspiratorial political plot has clearly not convinced most French people.\nAt least not yet.\nSo where does this verdict \u2013 clearly a seismic moment in French politics \u2013 leave the National Rally and the wider far-right movement?\nThe short answer is that no one knows. There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.\nThe most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.\nThat could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.\nOne person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.\nIf social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. He has found a way to tap into the frustrations of people angry about falling living standards and concerns about immigration. \nBut turning youthful support into actual votes is not always straightforward, and other, more experienced and mainstream figures on the right may well be sensing an opportunity too.\nThe Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, is widely seen to be emerging as a potential contender. Some even wonder if the provocative television personality, Cyril Hanouna, might become a serious political force on the right of French politics.\nMeanwhile, Bardella, like the RN in general, has been on a highly disciplined mission to detoxify the party's once overtly racist and antisemitic brand. In February, for instance, he abandoned plans to speak at America's far-right CPAC event after Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon made a Nazi salute.\nBut this week's events have revealed that the RN is enthusiastically committed to the distinctly Trump-ian and populist strategy of blaming its misfortunes on a \"swamp\" of unelected officials. Bardella, meanwhile, complained about the recent closure of two right-wing media channels alongside his party's own legal struggles.\n\"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.\nIt's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.\nTo frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?\nAs for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined. But her destiny is not entirely in her own hands now. At the age of 56 she has become a familiar figure, fiery at times, but personally approachable, warm and, in political terms, profoundly influential and disciplined. So what next for her?\nFrance has had one Le Pen or other (Marine's father, Jean-Marie ran four times) on their presidential ballot paper since 1988. Always unsuccessfully.\nHistory may well look back on this week as the moment Marine Le Pen's fate was sealed, in one of three ways: as France's first female and first far-right president, swept to power on a tide of outrage. As the four-time loser of a French presidential election, finally denied power by the taint of corruption. Or as someone whose soaring political career was brought to an early and shuddering halt by her own miscalculations over a serious embezzlement scandal.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "summary": "There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.The most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.Getty ImagesMarine Le Pen followed her father Jean-Marie (right) to take over the far-right National Rally party (formerly the National Front) That could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.One person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.If social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. \"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.But it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge1 day agoShareSaveAndrew HardingParis correspondentShareSaveBBCOutrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.Listen to Andrew read this articleThe airwaves have been throbbing with indignation. \"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.As France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.No clear frontrunner for presidentNervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.But other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.Getty ImagesAn opinion poll carried out a day before the court decision predicted that Le Pen would secure up to 37% of votes in the 2027 presidential electionAn early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. \"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.It's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.To frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?Getty ImagesEmmanuel Macron was re-elected in 2022 - he is not entitled to stand for another term and there no clear alternative to Le PenAs for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined.",

        "article_text": "Jon Hamm excels in Apple TV+'s \"emotionally real but absurdist\" drama about a desperate corporate man who resorts to stealing from his neighbours.\nJon Hamm has his best role since Mad Men and brings all his sharp comic timing and dramatic nuance to it as Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a hedge-fund manager who loses his job and manoeuvres to maintain his elaborate lifestyle and sense of himself. If you took Don Draper and dropped him into 2025 he might be Coop, a corporate man with a broken marriage and two teenaged children, a decent guy and a charmer with all-around bad judgement. Your Friends and Neighbors is emotionally real and affecting but also absurdist and funny, a rare combination.\nThe show begins with Coop waking up in a pool of blood next to a man's dead body in the foyer of a neighbour's mansion. He cleans up the blood \u2013 a bad move \u2013 and in one of the many mordant voiceovers that run through the series, looks back four months to reflect on \"the swirling hot mess of my life\". His worst choice is replacing his lost income by stealing loot from friends so rich they'll never miss it. The robberies are the comic vein in the story, but also a Trojan horse for its drama. Coop is hurt and distraught over the loss of his marriage, but that theme exists next to the caper-like thefts. The series is edgier and smarter than its entertaining surface suggests, as it deftly takes on issues of family, class privilege, vapid materialism and toxic masculinity.\nLike most series, this could start a bit faster, as it sets up the life Coop is accustomed to in a suburban New York community of huge houses and country clubs, where $200,000 cars and $60,000 donations to charity are ordinary. That was his life until he found his wife Mel (Amanda Peet) in bed with his so-called friend, Nick (Mark Tallman), a former basketball star still in great shape. The divorce has sent Coop out of his expansive home into a smaller rental house nearby.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 11 of the best TV shows to watch this April\n\u2022 A new Hollywood take-down is a must-see\n\u2022 Why on-screen male nudity is still taboo\nBut soon enough the first episode gets to its boldest turn as we see why Coop lost his job. A woman who works at his firm, whom he has never met and who doesn't report to him, comes on to him in a bar. Months later, that consensual hookup leads to his being fired for violating the company's HR rules. Pop culture has at times gingerly dipped a toe into the theme of sexual harassment. On The Morning Show, Steve Carell's character, a toxic predator, was sent off a cliff to die. But there has been nothing as complicated as this. The show doesn't deny Coop's bad judgement but also makes it clear through the woman herself and Coop's ruthless boss that the HR rule was a convenient excuse to get rid of him while keeping his clients. The show doesn't go far beyond that in exploring the issue, but it sets up the series' complex realism about social standards.\u00a0\nA non-compete clause makes Coop unhireable, but he insists on keeping up appearances. His burglaries are treated like adventures, punctuated by mock ads as he describes the luxury items he's lifting, with voiceovers that slyly echo Hamm's in all those Mercedes-Benz commercials. \"The Patek Phillippe Nautilus: sealed 18-carat white gold...\" Coop says, talking about an item no one really needs.\nThe series' real strength, though, is in his relationships, most of them driven by his wounded pride, and the way his identity has been tied to his role as a successful man of the world. Hamm smoothly navigates the shifts in tone, never allowing the humour to flag while letting us see the emotional pain Coop won't reveal to anyone around him. There is a lot of residual affection between Coop and his cheating ex-wife, whom Peet manages to make sympathetic. When Mel worries and asks him what's wrong, he displays a classic alpha-male inability to share feelings. \"I'm fine,\" he tells her when clearly he is not. Olivia Munn has less to do as Sam, a divorced neighbour and Coop's occasional fling. And Lena Hall is brilliant as Coop's sister, Ali. Briefly off her meds, she stalks her ex-fianc\u00e9, sitting on his lawn with her guitar and singing. Hall, who won a Tony for her role in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2014, sings occasionally through the series \u2013 an asset, not an intrusion. She makes Ali empathetic, funny and warm, and the bond between the brother and sister is touching. After she is back on her meds, her romantic subplot suggests that theirs really is a family full of bad choices.\nA second season of the show has already been ordered, so the question of whether Coop will pay for his crimes will linger. That plot is an effective hook, but his resonant feelings and increasing self-knowledge set the show apart. At a party of male friends hosted by Nick \u2013 why is Coop even there? more bad choices \u2013 he looks around at the men who still have their jobs and money, and sees the person he might have become. \"Their future was already written, and so the quest to stave off the emptiness began,\" he says in voiceover, observing their devotion to \"Scotch and cigars\", to \"custom golf clubs and high-end escorts\". He recognises that there are \"entire industries built to cash in on the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\". By even acknowledging that desperation, through a hero who is sympathetic \u2013 however wrong-headed his path to self-awareness \u2013 Your Friends and Neighbors is radically different from any other show around.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nYour Friends and Neighbors is on Apple TV+ from 11 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0\nsign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook, \nX and \nInstagram.

Meh.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nIf Kieran Trippier can reproduce his form of the past two seasons, he is a great differential defensive pick\nEmi Martinez, Aston Villa, keeper, \u00a35m - Nottingham Forest (h)\nThe Argentine kept just his fourth clean sheet of the season in Wednesday's win at Brighton but he is a differential keeper option for this week and the rest of the season.\nVilla face goal-shy Southampton next week before a double in 33.\nForest are not an easy opponent for Villa but they are definitely not as threatening without injured striker Chris Wood.\nVirgil van Dijk, Liverpool, \u00a36.5m - Fulham (a)\nLiverpool's defence is rolling at the moment, with three clean sheets in their past four including keeping Manchester City and Newcastle out.\nAnd Van Dijk has only scored once so far this season. He has not finished a season with just one goal since 2020-21, so the law of averages means he is due.\nDjed Spence, Spurs, \u00a34.4m - Southampton (h)\nWhile Tottenham's form is nose-diving again, they face a Saints side with just 22 goals in 30 games - the league's lowest total.\nSpence seems to be holding down that right-back spot and, if they do keep a clean sheet, has a great chance of bonus.\nIn Tottenham's recent back-to-back clean sheets, against Brentford and Manchester United, Spence earned the maximum three bonus points.\nKieran Trippier, Newcastle, \u00a35.6m - Leicester (a)\nAm I getting suckered in with memories of prime Trippier from the past two seasons, when he had nine and 10 assists? Possibly.\nIs picking a defender against Leicester each week the most obvious call? Yes.\nThat makes Trippier worth a punt in my opinion, even if he is nursing a potential groin issue.\nHe took three set-pieces, made three crosses and two key passes in Wednesday's win over Brentford, so you're getting a defender who is pretty involved in attacking play.\nDouble up on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli?\nMohamed Salah (vice-captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Fulham (a)\nSalah has failed to score in two of his past three games and his expected goal involvement (xGI) of 0.17 against Everton on Wednesday was the Egyptian's lowest all season.\nBut this man has 44 goal involvements in 2024-25 so don't give up on him yet!\nThere could come a time - especially if you are chasing your rivals - where going without Salah makes sense in a few weeks, as Liverpool won't have a double gameweek this season.\nBut not yet.\nJacob Murphy, Newcastle, \u00a35m - Leicester (a)\nFPL players may be looking at Anthony Gordon as the best Newcastle midfield option, with a double gameweek next week for the Magpies.\nBut Murphy, at just \u00a35m, can easily match Gordon.\nHe has nine assists now this season and has started every game since week 14. Bargain.\nBukayo Saka, Arsenal, \u00a310.3m - Everton (a)\nSaka has gone from 'player to watch' to essential in this column in the space of three weeks.\nYour only worry is whether, with a Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid coming up, the England man is rested for the odd game having just come back from injury.\nBut a start against Everton seems certain and Saka is still second on the assists chart with 11 this season, despite missing just over three months.\nGabriel Martinelli, Arsenal, \u00a36.5m - Everton (a)\nSaka's return is good for team-mate Martinelli, even though a trip to Everton isn't exactly easy on paper.\nThe pair had a combined 52 goals and assists two seasons ago, getting on the end of each other's crosses, and with a double gameweek in 33 of Palace (h) and Ipswich (a), why not double up on the Arsenal attack?\nAlexander Isak (captain), Newcastle, \u00a39.5m - Leicester (a)\nThe 20-goal striker is a slight injury doubt but you have to go with him against this Championship-bound Leicester side.\nCaptaining Manchester City's Marmoush against Leicester paid off last week so we go again!\nLiam Delap, Ipswich, \u00a35.6m - Wolves (h)\nThis is a must-win game for Ipswich and we're at the stage of the season where form goes out of the window a little.\nPortman Road will be pumped up and if Town do pull off a victory, chances are Delap will be involved in some way.\nThe 11-goal striker has been involved in 43% of Ipswich's goals this season, a statistic bettered only by four strikers who have played more than 10 games - Isak, Erling Haaland, Wolves' Matheus Cunha (who is suspended for this one) and Jamie Vardy.\nDominic Solanke, Spurs, \u00a37.3m - Southampton (h)\nThis is a pure gut-feel pick (you need one in every team right?) as Solanke has no form to speak of. He had an expected goals (xG) of zero in Thursday's defeat at Chelsea.\nBut the England striker was just getting motoring before an injury after gameweek 21 put him out for six matches. Solanke had three goals and two assists in the six games before that, and has the potential to go off against a doomed Southampton side.\nDean Henderson, Crystal Palace, keeper, \u00a34.6m - Brighton (h)\nMorgan Rogers, Aston Villa, midfielder, \u00a35.5m - Nottingham Forest (h)\nRayan Ait-Nouri, Wolves, defender, \u00a34.8m - Ipswich (a)\nAaron Wan-Bissaka, West Ham, defender, \u00a34.5m - Bournemouth (h)\n\nTeam total cost: \u00a394.5m\nWilliam Saliba's new centre-back partner could be Poland's Jakub Kiwior, right \nJakub Kiwior, Arsenal, defender, \u00a34.8m\nAre we about to get a cheap entry into one of the Premier League's best defences, with a double gameweek on the horizon?\nWith Gabriel out for the season, Riccardo Calafiori injured, and Jurrien Timber and Ben White injury doubts, Kiwior could be the next man up.\nHe has performed before when called upon.\nAston Villa - Nottingham Forest (h), Southampton (a), DOUBLE GAMEWEEK - Newcastle (h), Manchester City (a)\nIt's just picking the right Villa player for this run of games - everyone apart from Morgan Rogers seems a bit of a punt, with the usually reliable Ollie Watkins having been benched for two consecutive games in all competitions.\nWith a Champions League quarter-final against Paris St-Germain crammed in between these games as well, it might be prudent to wait until the double before choosing your Villa assets.\nBut both Marcus Rashford (\u00a36.6m) and Marco Asensio (\u00a36.1m) could be amazing differential picks.\nPremier League index\nPremier League table\nPremier League fixtures\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you",

        "article_text": "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.\n\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".\nOn his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.\nHezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.\nHezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.\nIn the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"\nBut the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.\nI visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.\nYou can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here\nHezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets in around northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.\nThe pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.\nIn the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.\nAt the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.\nSouthern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.\nA 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".\nAccording to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.\nIran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.\nAlia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"\nIt is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.\nBut the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.\nUltimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.\nNasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.\n\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".\nAs part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.\nDiscussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.\nThe businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".\nFor weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.\nAdam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.\nProminent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

Racecards, live text, results & reports on the BBC Sport website and app.\nRunners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.\nNote: Colours and approximate odds may change.\n(Racecard number, horse, trainer, jockey, recent form, age, weight carried [ie 11st 12lb is top weight]. Form: F - Fell, P - Pulled up, U - Unseated rider.)\nVerdict: Lots with chances but Senior Chief could still be improving, while Hewick looks primed to run well.\n1 Senior Chief 2 Hewick 3 Stumptown 4 Iroko\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Paul Townend\nForm: 311-P8 Age: 9 Weight: 11-12\nConvincing victor last year, having won the Irish National 12 months earlier, and could well be in the shake-up again. Pinpointed two months ago by 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy - who advises the owner - as the pick of JP McManus' stellar squad. Would be the first horse carrying top weight to triumph since the legendary Red Rum in the 1970s.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Venetia Williams Jockey: Charlie Deutsch\nForm: F-1P66 Age: 11 Weight:11-9\nThrives in different conditions, at Haydock in the mud \u2013 scene of five of his seven career victories, including back-to-back runnings of the Betfair Chase. Past three runs have been disappointing. Owned by flamboyant former banker Rich Ricci, you might not get rich backing this one although trainer did triumph with 100-1 outsider Mon Mome in 2009.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 125-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Patrick Mullins\nForm: 73-411 Age: 8 Weight: 11-8\nOwner Stewart Andrew clearly thinks he's a rocket - he eyed Cheltenham Gold Cup, but trainer preferred to go for the National. Would be an emotional winner as Andrew's wife Sadie died in December 2022, five days after watching Nick Rockett in his first race. A winner of the Thyestes Chase then Bobbyjo Chase, where Intense Raffles was runner-up, but that rival better off at the weights here. Jockey rides for trainer father.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian Hayes\nForm: 1-P625 Age: 9 Weight: 11-8\nWould be a poignant winner as the last horse bought for owners Cheveley Park Stud by joint boss David Thompson at the end of 2020, just 19 days before his death. Runner-up in Irish Gold Cup to Galopin Des Champs at 66-1 when finishing ahead of subsequent Cheltenham winners Fact To File and Inothewayurthinkin. Drying ground should suit.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: John Joseph Hanlon (IRE) Jockey: Gavin Sheehan\nForm: 232571 Age: 10 Weight: 11-7\nAn \u00a3800 bargain buy who has won big races including the King George VI Chase, Bet365 Gold Cup, Galway Plate and American Grand National. Trainer, nicknamed 'Shark', has taken horse into local pub to celebrate victories, and believes he could be sent off favourite. Well backed in lead-up to race, would be suited by dry spell with good going right up his street.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael Blackmore\nForm: 443-26 Age: 12 Weight: 11-3\nLooked a potential winner last year in closing stages before finishing third. Triumphed in 2021 Cheltenham Gold Cup for trainer, who won National a month later with stablemate Minella Times as Rachael Blackmore became first female jockey to win the race. Could easily be prominent again for her although would be some effort to become only third horse to complete Gold Cup-National double.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O'Keeffe\nForm: 2-5351 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nShowed bundles of promise when winning the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival four years ago but much of that has been unfulfilled. Won for the first time in two years last time out at Thurles. Not the most obvious victor in trainer's talented team and no guarantee at all that he will appreciate this marathon distance.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Jonathan Burke\nForm: 0-8P43 Age: 9 Weight: 11-2\nWhile powerful trainer has other hopefuls, including last year's winner, don't let this one go under the radar. Third under top weight to Intense Raffles in last year's Irish Grand National before winning Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown. Breeding and form point to potential for big run. Minella horses take their name from a Tipperary family hotel run by racehorse trader John Nallen.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jordan Gainford\nForm:  U58708 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nBoasts some decent form including Irish Gold Cup win, when Minella Indo was second, albeit that was three years ago. Has run well at this meeting before, including a good second to Jonbon over shorter distance last year. Trainer seeking fourth victory in race, but suspicion is age, weight and longer trip may be against this one.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Keith Donoghue\nForm: -U1111 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nSecured fourth straight victory of the season by winning Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham Festival in fine style last month. That is the same race Tiger Roll won before his 2018 and 2019 National triumphs. Stumptown's trainer went to town at Cheltenham by landing the Gold Cup with Inothewayurthinkin, who was then made hot favourite for this but skips the race.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 8-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Freddie Gingell\nForm: 83-222 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nPart-owned by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Hitman has been a bit hit and miss. Has a habit of coming second - finishing runner-up in 11 of his 26 races - and this distance is a real unknown. Talented 19-year-old jockey credits much of his success to his mother Kim who died in 2020 from cancer aged 43.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies\nForm: 1P-132 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nJockey rides for trainer father, who has landed the race twice before. Winner of Midlands Grand National last year. Owner Bryan Burrough hoping for second success, 42 years after his colours were carried to victory by the Jenny Pitman-trained Corbiere. It's a tough ask but had a convincing victory over fences at Ascot earlier in season and stamina looks assured.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: James Reveley\nForm: 6-2383  Age: 10 Weight: 11-0\nForm has dipped since reaching top of his game two or three years ago. Won jump racing's festive showpiece, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, in 2022 and was second a year later. In between, finished runner-up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Will take a brave man or woman to pick this one after an 11-race losing run. Stable jockey rides Kandoo Kid.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: James Bowen\nForm: 9-5515  Age: 11 Weight: 10-13\nBit of an enigma. Was on a 10-race losing run when won well at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Maybe he was just in the party mood. Green and gold colours of owner JP McManus look more likely to succeed elsewhere, although there is a breeding positive - Chantry House's sire Yeats was also dad to 2022 National winner Noble Yeats.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Skelton\nForm: 210-32 Age: 10 Weight: 10-12\nNamed after owner Max McNeill's late father and ex-professional golfer Ted, who was three under par through five holes to lead The Open at Royal Portrush in 1951. Will the gelding be above or below par? Fourth in the Scottish National two years ago but well behind Minella Cocooner and Nick Rockett in last season's Bet365 Gold Cup.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Mark Walsh\nForm: 286411  Age: 8 Weight: 10-12\nAnother powerful weapon in the armoury of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer, who also has Stumptown and Vanillier. A beaten favourite for both the Galway Plate and Kerry National but form of his Leopardstown win in December reads well and now takes a big step up in trip. Named after a 1970s film about a 12th Century knight, could he put his rivals to the sword here?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 12-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Cobden\nForm: P23-18 Age: 9 Weight: 10-11\nDecent third in Topham Chase over National fences last year. Won Coral Gold Cup, formerly the Hennessy, at Newbury in November. Only one horse, Many Clouds, has gone on to also win the National, though trainer thinks he can do it. He won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges and says the grey Kandoo Kid is the \"ideal horse for the race\".\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1\nTrainer: Oliver Greenall & Josh Guerriero Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr\nForm: 2-2F42  Age: 7 Weight: 10-11\nA Cheltenham Festival winner in 2023. Second at Aintree meeting 12 months ago to subsequent Gold Cup winner Inowthewayurthinkin when nominated by owner JP McManus as his 'National horse for next year'. Joint-trainer Oliver Greenall's father Lord Daresbury is former racecourse chairman who has an Aintree stand named after him. Co-trainer Josh Guerriero won Foxhunters' Chase over National fences as amateur jockey in 2008.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 9-1\nTrainer: Tom Gibney (IRE) Jockey: JJ Slevin\nForm: 11-902 Age: 7 Weight: 10-10\nSounds like a deadly serious lottery, and has a deadly serious chance. Winner of the Irish Grand National last year. Nearly all of his races have been on soft or heavy ground. The grey runs in the 'double green' colours of owner-breeders Simon Munir and Isaac Souede. Showed his wellbeing when second, despite carrying more weight, to Nick Rockett at Fairyhouse in February.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O'Keeffe\nForm: 1P-169 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10\nPulled up in last year's Irish National but marked himself out as a candidate for this race when winning well at Cheltenham in October. Subsequently sixth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury when he was staying on, which could be a good sign for the test ahead. Owned by the Lucky In Life Syndicate. Will the horse live up to their name?\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Richard Phillips Jockey: Harry Bannister\nForm: F03106 Age: 11 Weight: 10-10\nPreviously based in Ireland, where he won the Midlands National last summer at Kilbeggan. Having second run for amiable Gloucestershire trainer, who does a nice line in impressions. He helped buy the horse with John Rosbotham, a friend of 55 years with whom he dreamed in the school playground of having a National runner, and it runs for a syndicate of 12 called the Dozen Dreamers.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey:  Sam Ewing\nForm: 212433 Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nFive of his six wins have come at roughly half the distance of this race. Looks an uphill task on the face of it, but interestingly mentioned as a potential surprise package by the trainer \u2013 who has won three times previously - when weights for the race were announced in February. Would probably benefit from soft ground.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Tom Bellamy\nForm: 5-324P Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nOwner David Proos hoping to go two better after his family silks were carried to third by Rinus in 1990. No forlorn hope based on his second to Kandoo Kid in Coral Gold Cup at Newbury. One for alliteration fans - could Broadway Boy follow Mon Mome, Party Politics and Red Rum as a nifty-sounding National winner for trainer, who has triumphed twice before?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarvey\nForm: U50029 Age: 10 Weight: 10-9\nEleventh in last year's race, when hampered late on, having previously finished eighth and pulled up. Prominent on each occasion before fading. Winner of the Troytown Chase in 2023. Will probably be spotted towards the front again but takes a leap of faith to see him stay there and become only the fourth grey horse to win the National.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Paul O'Brien\nForm: 3PP-P0 Age: 8 Weight: 10-9\nLooked to be heading for big things after winning Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023 but career over the bigger obstacles has not been straightforward and pulled up on three of his past four runs. Jockey called up for first ride in race after original bookings Bryony Frost (riding in France) then Johnny Burke (on Minella Cocooner instead) were unavailable\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny Mullins\nForm: 37-008 Age: 8 Weight: 10-7\n'Caught the eye' of last year's winning trainer when the weights were revealed in February. Finished seventh in 2024 when appeared to run out of steam. That could be perceived as a stamina doubt, although might see out the trip better now a year stronger and stable's Hedgehunter won in 2005 after a tired late fall the previous year.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Jonjo & AJ O'Neill Jockey: Nick Scholfield\nForm: 5P-241 Age: 9 Weight: 10-9\nIntriguing contender who finished fourth in the Welsh Grand National before ending a two-year losing run with victory at Uttoxeter. Finished third to subsequent National winner Corach Rambler at Cheltenham Festival two years ago. Formerly owned by Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman before being sold last year to Martin Tedham, who sponsors the trainer's yard.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Sean Flanagan\nForm: -P6913 Age: 10 Weight: 10-6\nThis was my selection in 2023, when he ended up finishing second to Corach Rambler for shrewd trainer. Was 14th last year on softer ground but comfortable Punchestown win in February showcased his credentials.

        "article_text": "The bacteria and fungi living on your skin play a surprising role in keeping us healthy. Is it possible to give them a boost?\nScratch the surface of the skin, and you'll find a bustling community of bacteria living there. This is a good thing, as research increasingly shows that having the \"right kind\" of microbes can help keep our skin young, supple, and smooth for longer. Simply by being there, \"good bacteria\" protect us from infection from pathogenic, harmful microbes. They also help to repair wounds and may even counteract some of the harmful effects of UV rays.\u00a0\nAll-the-more reason to look after our skin microbiome. But how do we do this? One method that has become increasingly popular is the use of topical skin probiotics \u2013 which technically means applying live microorganisms to the skin to improve its health.\nAs far back as 1912, scientists were rubbing bacteria into people's faces in an attempt to improve conditions such as acne and seborrhea \u2013 a common form of dermatitis that causes a red, itchy rash and white or yellow scales.\nToday there are dozens of skincare companies selling what they describe as probiotic products, from serums to cleansers and moisturisers. In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it \"renewed\" and \"refreshed\".\u00a0\nBut while skincare products often claim to be \"probiotic\", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.\nWhat's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as \"cosmetics\" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's difficult to know how effective they are.\u00a0\n\"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent,\" says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\nMost \"probiotic\" skincare products contain either prebiotics \u2013 nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or postbiotics \u2013 proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.\n\"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome,\" says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of\u00a0S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial \"transplants\".\nAccording to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process. Once on the skin there's no guarantee that they'll even take hold, as they must fight to compete with the millions of other microbes already living there.\nThe idea of promoting a healthy skin microbiome is rooted in the theory that bacteria and fungi living on the outside of our body help to protect us from those that might do us harm.\nYet the science behind how certain \"bad\" bacteria can contribute to skin diseases isn't yet fully understood. What we do know is that people with eczema, rosacea, acne and psoriasis all have different types or levels of certain bacteria living on their skin.\n\"What exists at the moment is a lot of papers showing that nearly every skin disease imaginable is associated with a shift in the skin microbiome,\" says Paetzold. \"But this observation just shows an association. It doesn't say that the shift in the microbiome causes that disease. It could also be that the disease changes the skin environment, and that's why the bacterial population changes.\"\nTo prove that a particular strain of bacteria is causing a disease, you would need to either give a healthy person that skin disease by slathering the \"bad bacteria\" on their face, or cure their disease by applying \"good\" bacteria. While the first option is likely to encounter ethical barriers, there are a few researchers attempting the latter.\nThe limited clinical trials that have been published, however, do show promising results. Most focus on using live bacteria to treat eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. They are based on the findings that the skin of people with eczema is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that can often be pathogenic.\n\"One of the big problems in the skin for diseases like eczema, is that certain pathogenic bacteria like S. aureus live on the surface of the skin and cause rashes, cause disease, and cause infection,\" says Gallo, whose own research group has been searching for ways of harnessing the skin microbiome to fight off the harmful bacteria found thriving on eczema patients. \"We mined the bacteria types that usually live on healthy skin looking for bacteria that could produce things that would fight off those bad bacteria\".\nGallo's are focusing on Staphylococcus hominis, a naturally occurring skin bacterium which is present in 21% of healthy people, but only 1% of atopic dermatitis patients.\n\"Our skin provides commensal bacteria like S. hominis with a safe place to live, so some of them have evolved a way of protecting their environment from these bad bacteria that are trying to invade,\" says Gallo.\nIn the case of S. hominis, the bacterium produces anti-microbial peptides \u2013 small fragments of protein \u2013 which directly kill S. aureus. They also produce chemicals called \"autoinducing peptides\", which stop bacterial cells from communicating with one another. Some bacteria like S. aureus signal to one another when their population density reaches a certain level \u2013 a mechanism known as quorum sensing \u2013 triggering the secretion of toxins that can cause skin inflammation. Disrupting that communication can prevent the toxins from being released.\nIn 2021, Gallo's team conducted a phase one randomised controlled trial with 54 adults with atopic dermatitis by applying a cream containing live S. hominis over the course of one week. The results showed that treatment with S. hominis dramatically reduced S. aureus\u00a0colonisation, and even decreased the redness and itch associated with atopic dermatitis in a subgroup of patients compared to a control group given a placebo cream.\nThe findings suggest that using special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier. But more work needs to be done to prove its effectiveness before it can be used as a treatment. The team are now recruiting for a phase two randomised trial which will assess the efficacy of the treatment over a longer 14 week timescale.\u00a0\nElsewhere, other researchers have also had success treating eczema with probiotics. In one 2003 clinical trial, 11 patients with atopic dermatitis were given a cream containing the bacterium\u00a0Streptococcus thermophiles, which they applied for two weeks. The results showed\u00a0that the cream enhanced the skin's production of ceramides \u2013 lipids that help to keep the skin hydrated and maintain it as a healthy barrier.\u00a0\nMore recently, in 2018 10 adults and five children with atopic dermatitis were given a \"microbiome transplant\", where live Roseomonas mucosa bacteria collected from the skin of healthy volunteers was then applied to the skin of the patients twice a week. After 16 weeks, the treatment improved their symptoms by more than 50%.\nAlthough clinical trials focusing on other skin conditions are somewhat rarer, they also show promising results. Acne, for example, is linked to colonisation by the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Some researchers are therefore looking for bacteria that produce antimicrobial peptides to inhibit or kill this bacterium. In one clinical trial, a lotion containing\u00a0the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis\u00a0was given to patients suffering from severe acne. The lotion significantly reduced pustules compared to a placebo lotion.\nPaetzold and his company S-Biomedic, meanwhile, published a clinical trial in 2019 where they gave patients with acne a cream containing specific strains of Cutibacterium acnes. The results showedsome reduction in acne.\u00a0\nGallo is also researching whether a strain of Staphylococcus capitis bacteria could be an effective acne treatment, with studies in animals showing promising results.\u00a0\n\"The basic mechanism of action is very straightforward. It just inhibits the C. acnes growth, much in the same way that topical antibiotics or oral antibiotics are used to treat acne,\" says Gallo.\u00a0\nUnlike topical antibiotics, however, the treatment specifically targets C. acnes, so the wider skin microbiome is left unharmed, he says.\nGallo's team has even found a specific strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria that produce molecules that may inhibit the development of sun induced skin cancer.\n\"It generates a small molecule that inhibits DNA synthesis in transformed or mutagenic skin cells,\" says Gallo. \"We've found in \nanimal models\n that if these bacteria are present on the surface of mice that undergo UV radiation damage, they get far fewer skin tumours than mice that have the same species of bacteria, but not the genes [in the bacteria] that make this anti-metabolite.\"\nOf course, such a treatment will have to go through much more testing and clinical trials before it can be shown to have a similar effect in humans.\nWhile most studies have looked at treating specific diseases with probiotics, there are also a few that have examined whether pre- or postbiotics could improve skin health generally.\u00a0 For example, some researchers are looking at whether inulin \u2013 a dietary fibre frequently found in cosmetics and personal care products \u2013 could serve as a prebiotic when taken as an oral supplement or applied topically to the skin. Preliminary results suggest that inulin makes the skin more smooth and supple, providing a more favourable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive. Other studies have shown that slapping on sphingomyelinase, an\u00a0enzyme produced by bacteria such as Staphylococcus thermophilus \u2013 which are commonly found in fermented milk products and yogurt \u2013 can boost production of ceramides, which are needed to keep the skin healthy.\nHowever in all cases, large randomised double blind clinical trials \u2013 the gold standard of medical research \u2013 are needed to confirm whether any of these creams are effective.\u00a0\nFor example a recent review study examined all of the data from clinical trials conducted to date and concluded that while \"oral and topical probiotics appear to be effective for the treatment of certain inflammatory skin diseases and demonstrate a promising role in wound healing and skin cancer, more studies are needed to confirm these results\".\u00a0\nGallo agrees that more work is needed but is hopeful about the future of the field.\n\"It's moving in the right direction,\" he says. \"We've come to realise as a field that we need to understand what exactly they're doing, and there's a lot of efforts being put into that, as well as other ways to design microbes to help benefit us. So I'm very optimistic about where we'll be in a few years with probiotics.\"\nHowever for people who don't have a skin disease, but who might want to increase the smoothness of their skin, prevent wrinkles, or boost hydration levels, there is little evidence that probiotic creams readily available in shops will have any benefit.\n\"I think many of the probiotics on the market now don't have very strong evidence behind them, so I wouldn't recommend those necessarily,\" says Gallo. \"You can try them \u2013 but it might not be the best use of your money.\"\nWhile your skin microbiome changes as you age and encounter different environments, there are a few things you can do to help your skin's natural microbiome flourish.\n\"It's a two-way street, because the types of things that we're already doing to moisturise our skin or protect the skin from UV damage are creating an environment that's more hospitable for these beneficial organisms to live in,\" says Gallo.\n\"So normal skin care, appropriate moisturising and cleansing \u2013 all of those things will promote skin health.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

It's just crazy.\"\nMr Black said AI was becoming a growing threat to independent publishers, with many tools using their original content without permission and presenting it in different formats for others to benefit from. \n\"It is really frustrating because now no-one will visit our websites,\" he said.\nHe also pointed out that larger news websites had struck deals with AI firms for collaboration, but said: \"There was no chance I'd be able to do that.\"\nAlthough Mr Black decided not to publish a fake story for April Fools' Day this year because he was \"too busy\", he said the experience had put him off and made him decide not to publish a fake story again.",

The visitors are sixth in France's Top 14 table after their recent victory over La Rochelle ended a run of five consecutive league defeats.Clermont booked their place in the knockout stages by snatching a dramatic 33-26 victory in the sixth minute of overtime to qualify at Bath and Bristol's expense.Elsewhere, Sale Sharks face a daunting trip to six-time winners and defending champions Toulouse, who will be without injured talisman Antoine Dupont after he ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee during France's Six Nations win over Ireland last month.Harlequins face an equally difficult task at four-time winners Leinster, while Leicester Tigers travel north to take on Glasgow Warriors.The full Irish contingentAll three Irish provinces which started in this season's competition have reached the knockout stages.Leinster lead the United Rugby Championship (URC) and will be targeting a fifth star on the jersey after finishing top of Pool 2 with a clean sweep of four comfortable wins.Fly-half Sam Prendergast has stepped into retired colossus Johnny Sexton's shoes for club and country seamlessly, while the bulk of Ireland's first-choice pack, including Josh van der Flier and Caelan Doris, ply their trade in Dublin.Munster finished third in Pool 3 to qualify for the last 16 and they will reunited with their former fly-half Ronan O'Gara in the next round.They will travel to the Stade Marcel-Deflandre to face the 2022 and 2023 champions La Rochelle, who are coached by O'Gara.Ireland legends Peter O'Mahony and Conor Murray have retired from the international stage and will want to end their long-standing Munster careers this summer with silverware.Ulster, meanwhile, won just one of their four Pool 1 games and scraped through to the knockout stages on points difference.They will face an away trip to title contenders Bordeaux-Begles, who finished top of Pool 1 after four bonus-point wins, including a 40-19 victory when the two sides last met in December. Scottish and Italian representationDefending URC champions Glasgow are flying the Scottish flag in the last 16 after finishing second in Pool 4.Warriors, who are also currently second in the URC, will welcome Tigers to Scotstoun in fine form after pummelling Johannesburg Lions 42-0 in their most recent outing.George Horne became the club's record try-scorer in their victory over the South African side, while Leicester were narrowly beaten by Saracens in their last Premiership match.Tigers are third in the English top-flight and outgoing head coach Michael Chieka says he will work harder to achieve success domestically and in Europe before leaving the club this summer. Benetton, meanwhile, will make their last-16 debut after a surprise 32-25 victory over two-time champions La Rochelle in their final Pool 2 game.The Italian side boast a large contingent of the  Italy national team, including their fearsome centre partnership of Juan Ignacio Brex and Tommaso Menoncello.Like Italy, Benetton play a free-flowing brand of rugby and will pose a threat in their trip to French side Castres.French dominanceSix of this season's last 16 hail from France. Bordeaux-Begles made light work of the pool stages and in France wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey, who last month broke the record for the most tries scored in a Six Nations campaign, boast one of the deadliest finishers in world rugby.Despite the loss of Dupont, Top 14 leaders Toulouse are also among the favourites to secure a record seventh European crown.Three-time winners Toulon finished top of Pool 4 despite a heavy defeat by Sale Sharks and will be favourites to overcome an under-strength Saracens side.La Rochelle, meanwhile, are without a win in eight matches since they beat Toulouse in January.O'Gara has previously led his side to back-to-back Champions Cup titles but he will have to stop this year's rot if he wishes to overcome his former side Munster.Pool 3 runners-up Castres and Clermont Auvergne make up the French sextet.What's up next?It could be another final between the tournament's two most successful sides on 24 May at Principality Stadium as Toulouse and Leinster both ended up on opposite sides of the draw.Northampton will play a home quarter-final if they can navigate their way past Clermont, while a potential semi-final rematch from last year's competition could await against Leinster.However, a victory for Quins over Leinster and a Leicester win in Glasgow would also set-up an all-Premiership tie in the next round.Quarter-final draw (ties to be played on the weekend 11/12/13 April):Bordeaux-Begles/Ulster v La Rochelle/MunsterToulon/Saracens v Toulouse/Sale SharksLeinster/Harlequins v Glasgow Warriors/Leicester TigersNorthampton Saints/Clermont Auvergne v Castres or BenettonSemi-final draw (ties to be played on the weekend 2/3/4 May):Bordeaux/Ulster/La Rochelle/Munster v Toulon/Saracens/Toulouse/SaleLeinster/Harlequins/Glasgow/Leicester Tigers v Northampton/Clermont/Castres/BenettonRelated topicsMunsterGlasgow WarriorsSaleUlsterNorthampton SaintsLeinsterSaracensRugby UnionLeicester TigersHarlequins",

How does the company know that users are who they say they are - how will perpetrators be traced when grooming keeps happening?\"\nRoblox highlighted to BBC News its community standards, which have a zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors.\nAmir from Leeds told the BBC last month that his 15-year-old son is \"addicted\" to Roblox, and can use the site for up to 14 hours a day.\nHe has welcomed the changes announced today for younger users, but wants the platform itself to do more and target the availability of inappropriate games for children.\nKathryn Foley's nine-year-old daughter Helene is a regular on Roblox.

        "article_text": "After three years and one month, 7,500 tonnes of stone and \u00a35m spent, the road dubbed 'the UK's wonkiest' has been fixed - but why did it take so long to repair?\nIn February 2022 the B4069 Lyneham Banks in Wiltshire gave way, suffering a landslip after Storm Eunice.\nIt was closed and slipped even more, causing huge cracks in the surface and leading to it becoming a playground for BMX riders.\nAbout 90 metres of the road was lost. That might not sound like much, but the fix has required some serious engineering - much more than just laying some tarmac.\nIn fact, the tarmacking and painting only took about a week. But what went before was far more complex, not least because the road was still slowly sliding away.\nWiltshire Council said it had to wait for the land to mostly stop moving before it could do much.\nIt also had to get a lot of ground investigations done, something the council has said was \"absolutely necessary\" and means the same problem should not happen again.\nThe new section of road and its supports has been designed to last around 120 years and took 25,000 work hours.\nContractors Octavius did the work, which the company perhaps understatedly described as \"a challenge\", starting in July 2024.\n\"The hillside was still creeping when we commenced work, and such ground conditions demanded some creative solutions,\" said Chris Hudson, operations director of Octavius' highways business.\nMassive excavators and cranes were needed - something made trickier by being in a rural area with limited access to the site.\nThe repair crews also had extra issues with more wet weather and not wanting to make the slipping worse.\n\"We came with an initial plan - the access changed that plan several times. We adapted,\" said Mr Hudson.\nHe explained that masses of earth had to be taken away to make the area more stable.\nThen a 108m-long huge retaining wall had to be put in place.\nBig concrete pillars called bored piles - 120 of them - were put into the ground. \nThey go down 14 metres. To put that into perspective, most UK homes would not have foundations beyond a couple of metres into the earth.\nA large beam was then put on top of those and the slope above and below the road was reshaped with new drainage, using 560m of drainage channels and grates and 1,000 tonnes of stone counterforts.\nAltogether for the project, 650 cubic metres of concrete was needed and 2,370 bags of grout.\nThere have been finishing touches too - 600 new plants now run alongside the road.\nThe road would usually take around 5,500 vehicles a day, but for three years these have all been diverted through smaller villages.\nLocals have said they are thrilled to have it re-open and Wiltshire Council has thanked the community for its patience\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

But what went before was far more complex, not least because the road was still slowly sliding away.PA MediaWhen the road first closed, BMX riders would use it, but it soon became too dangerous for that tooWiltshire Council said it had to wait for the land to mostly stop moving before it could do much.It also had to get a lot of ground investigations done, something the council has said was \"absolutely necessary\" and means the same problem should not happen again.The new section of road and its supports has been designed to last around 120 years and took 25,000 work hours.The difficult ground conditions meant the repair work was challengingContractors Octavius did the work, which the company perhaps understatedly described as \"a challenge\", starting in July 2024. \"The hillside was still creeping when we commenced work, and such ground conditions demanded some creative solutions,\" said Chris Hudson, operations director of Octavius' highways business.Massive excavators and cranes were needed - something made trickier by being in a rural area with limited access to the site.The repair crews also had extra issues with more wet weather and not wanting to make the slipping worse.

        "article_text": "Jon Hamm excels in Apple TV+'s \"emotionally real but absurdist\" drama about a desperate corporate man who resorts to stealing from his neighbours.\nJon Hamm has his best role since Mad Men and brings all his sharp comic timing and dramatic nuance to it as Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a hedge-fund manager who loses his job and manoeuvres to maintain his elaborate lifestyle and sense of himself. If you took Don Draper and dropped him into 2025 he might be Coop, a corporate man with a broken marriage and two teenaged children, a decent guy and a charmer with all-around bad judgement. Your Friends and Neighbors is emotionally real and affecting but also absurdist and funny, a rare combination.\nThe show begins with Coop waking up in a pool of blood next to a man's dead body in the foyer of a neighbour's mansion. He cleans up the blood \u2013 a bad move \u2013 and in one of the many mordant voiceovers that run through the series, looks back four months to reflect on \"the swirling hot mess of my life\". His worst choice is replacing his lost income by stealing loot from friends so rich they'll never miss it. The robberies are the comic vein in the story, but also a Trojan horse for its drama. Coop is hurt and distraught over the loss of his marriage, but that theme exists next to the caper-like thefts. The series is edgier and smarter than its entertaining surface suggests, as it deftly takes on issues of family, class privilege, vapid materialism and toxic masculinity.\nLike most series, this could start a bit faster, as it sets up the life Coop is accustomed to in a suburban New York community of huge houses and country clubs, where $200,000 cars and $60,000 donations to charity are ordinary. That was his life until he found his wife Mel (Amanda Peet) in bed with his so-called friend, Nick (Mark Tallman), a former basketball star still in great shape. The divorce has sent Coop out of his expansive home into a smaller rental house nearby.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 11 of the best TV shows to watch this April\n\u2022 A new Hollywood take-down is a must-see\n\u2022 Why on-screen male nudity is still taboo\nBut soon enough the first episode gets to its boldest turn as we see why Coop lost his job. A woman who works at his firm, whom he has never met and who doesn't report to him, comes on to him in a bar. Months later, that consensual hookup leads to his being fired for violating the company's HR rules. Pop culture has at times gingerly dipped a toe into the theme of sexual harassment. On The Morning Show, Steve Carell's character, a toxic predator, was sent off a cliff to die. But there has been nothing as complicated as this. The show doesn't deny Coop's bad judgement but also makes it clear through the woman herself and Coop's ruthless boss that the HR rule was a convenient excuse to get rid of him while keeping his clients. The show doesn't go far beyond that in exploring the issue, but it sets up the series' complex realism about social standards.\u00a0\nA non-compete clause makes Coop unhireable, but he insists on keeping up appearances. His burglaries are treated like adventures, punctuated by mock ads as he describes the luxury items he's lifting, with voiceovers that slyly echo Hamm's in all those Mercedes-Benz commercials. \"The Patek Phillippe Nautilus: sealed 18-carat white gold...\" Coop says, talking about an item no one really needs.\nThe series' real strength, though, is in his relationships, most of them driven by his wounded pride, and the way his identity has been tied to his role as a successful man of the world. Hamm smoothly navigates the shifts in tone, never allowing the humour to flag while letting us see the emotional pain Coop won't reveal to anyone around him. There is a lot of residual affection between Coop and his cheating ex-wife, whom Peet manages to make sympathetic. When Mel worries and asks him what's wrong, he displays a classic alpha-male inability to share feelings. \"I'm fine,\" he tells her when clearly he is not. Olivia Munn has less to do as Sam, a divorced neighbour and Coop's occasional fling. And Lena Hall is brilliant as Coop's sister, Ali. Briefly off her meds, she stalks her ex-fianc\u00e9, sitting on his lawn with her guitar and singing. Hall, who won a Tony for her role in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2014, sings occasionally through the series \u2013 an asset, not an intrusion. She makes Ali empathetic, funny and warm, and the bond between the brother and sister is touching. After she is back on her meds, her romantic subplot suggests that theirs really is a family full of bad choices.\nA second season of the show has already been ordered, so the question of whether Coop will pay for his crimes will linger. That plot is an effective hook, but his resonant feelings and increasing self-knowledge set the show apart. At a party of male friends hosted by Nick \u2013 why is Coop even there? more bad choices \u2013 he looks around at the men who still have their jobs and money, and sees the person he might have become. \"Their future was already written, and so the quest to stave off the emptiness began,\" he says in voiceover, observing their devotion to \"Scotch and cigars\", to \"custom golf clubs and high-end escorts\". He recognises that there are \"entire industries built to cash in on the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\". By even acknowledging that desperation, through a hero who is sympathetic \u2013 however wrong-headed his path to self-awareness \u2013 Your Friends and Neighbors is radically different from any other show around.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nYour Friends and Neighbors is on Apple TV+ from 11 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0\nsign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook, \nX and \nInstagram.

        "article_text": "From Saturday, most goods imported to the US from anywhere in the world will face a 10% \"baseline\" tariff.\nDonald Trump announced higher rates for some countries he singled out as the \"worst offenders\" for trade.\nOur correspondents have been answering your questions about what this means and the impact it could have.\nDavid Rash, in Yeovil, asks Deputy Economics editor, Dharshini David, if the tariffs will lead to a stagnant world economy following a reduced supply of foreign goods into the US and a reduction of US exports?\nThis is a very real risk.\nThe tariffs introduced by President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in almost a century.\nIf they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.\nAnd those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.\nIn the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.\nBut as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.\nThat might appeal to consumers \u2013 but obviously, could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.\nMike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies? \nOne eye-catching consequence of the tariffs announcement has been the impact on Apple, with its share price falling 7%.\nThe US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).\nIn 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. Apple bosses will be hoping to work out a similar deal this time.\nThe global investment bank Citi said: \"If Apple cannot get exempted this time and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54% China tariffs and does not pass it through, we estimate about 9% negative impact to the company's total gross margin.\"\nIn February, Apple committed to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years. At the time, Trump claimed Apple's support for US manufacturing was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.\nPaul Miller, in Devon, asks Dharshini David, Deputy Economics editor, about the impact of tariffs on US consumers, and whether the UK could gain from them.\nUS shoppers could very much be the frontline casualties in this trade war, blighted by higher prices and less choice, regardless of the president's rhetoric.\nAnd that does mean that producers will seek out and take advantage of new markets.\nWe saw that in the president's first term, when the likes of Vietnam and Malaysia took advantage of the tariffs he imposed on China to increase the amount they sold to America.\nIronically, they consequently are in the firing line now - and so will likely be vying to sell more to the UK \u2013 good for consumers, less so for competing businesses\nAlready, many producers are turning their sights beyond established customers \u2013 think whisky makers looking towards Asia. That is likely to intensify.\nTrump's announcement may mean a redraft of the global trade map \u2013 and our own shopping lists.\nJock Scott, from Nuneaton, asks Business reporter Nick Edser if the US tariffs have an effect on the UK's cost of living. \nAs ever when looking at the implications of the tariffs, there's a lot of uncertainty over this. In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.\nThe tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.\nHowever, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs.

Our correspondents answer your questions.From Saturday, most goods imported to the US from anywhere in the world will face a 10% \"baseline\" tariff.Donald Trump announced higher rates for some countries he singled out as the \"worst offenders\" for trade.Our correspondents have been answering your questions about what this means and the impact it could have.Will the tariffs lead to a stagnant global economy?David Rash, in Yeovil, asks Deputy Economics editor, Dharshini David, if the tariffs will lead to a stagnant world economy following a reduced supply of foreign goods into the US and a reduction of US exports?This is a very real risk.The tariffs introduced by President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in almost a century.If they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.And those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.In the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.But as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.That might appeal to consumers \u2013 but obviously, could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.What happens to US products that are made in China?Mike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies? In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.The tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. One eye-catching consequence of the tariffs announcement has been the impact on Apple, with its share price falling 7%.The US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).In 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. The state pension is unaffected.Does the UK have a 'Brexit benefit' over the EU?Paul Naldrett from Windsor asks Business correspondent Marc Ashdown if the UK's position outside of the European Union is actually an opportunity as the EU is given 20% tariffs.Some are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.Not only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.UK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.British firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.But, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market.Trump tariffs",

It's just the most phenomenal dream come true.\"\nSouth Africa is the continent's second-most successful nation at the summer Olympics with 28 gold medals but, given its warm climate, it is yet to make a real impact at the Winter Games.\nThe country did not send anyone to the Sochi 2014 or Beijing 2022 Games, and Smith is set to be just the 16th South African to represent his country at the event.\n\"I just love putting South Africa on the map in a winter sport,\" he said.\n\"I'm not the first. I definitely won't be the last.\n\"We have heart, courage and determination as a nation. All these South African athletes who precede me have been champions.\"\nSmith has amassed more than 10,000 followers on Instagram by giving updates on his journey in cross-country skiing\nShortly after his move to the Norwegian capital Oslo, Smith's passion for the outdoors piqued an interest in skiing.\n\"I loved to run, cycle, swim outside, and then I moved to Norway as the snow was falling and the winter was coming,\" he explained.\n\"I thought to myself, I have two options here: either I lean into this or I hibernate.\"\nSmith chose to embrace the conditions in Scandinavia and, as fate would have it, his new hobby led to him meeting Allan Corona, a Mexican cross-country skier.\nThe two men have since formed a close bond, becoming training partners and also competing alongside one another on the international circuit.\n\"I just decided to take the bull by the horns,\" Smith said.\n\"If Allan can represent Mexico, why can't I represent South Africa?\"\nThen came bigger questions and an ambitious target.\n\"When's the next Olympics?\" Smith continued. \"Do we have anyone representing us? No.\n\"Is it humanly possible to qualify in two years' time and represent your country in three? I proved that it is.\"\nSmith secured South Africa a spot at Milan-Cortina at the Nordic World Ski Championships in Trondheim at the end of February.\nA 38th-placed finish in a 7.5km race - some 10 seconds behind Corona - earned him enough ranking points from the world governing body to achieve a dream which appeared unlikely when he took up the sport.\nSmith first took part in a competition sanctioned by the sport's world governing body in March 2023\nWith cross-country skiing dominated by traditional and well-resourced powerhouses such as Norway and Sweden, Smith has found support from fellow non-traditional winter sports nations.\nA sense of community has been fostered between athletes from those countries, especially via a WhatApp group called 'Team Avalanche' set up by Trinidad and Tobago's Nick Lau.\n\"It is 54 athletes from [the likes of] Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and we share resources,\" Smith said.\n\"We share beds, sofas, wax, skis.\n\"It's become a large community of nations that support each other. I'd argue that we have a stronger support community than the big nations.\n\"It's nice to see some flavour, some variety, in the sport. It might be a Nordic sport, but the global south is rising and it is becoming very much a global sport.\"\nWith his fiancee expecting to give birth to the couple's first child this year, Smith will have to manage his time wisely as he prepares for the Winter Olympics, which will take place in February next year.\n\"I've got the points I need to qualify. The comfort that I have now is I can go into the summer without stress,\" he said.\n\"I will hopefully have a month or two off where my son is born over summer, which is usually a quieter period.\n\"I will try to maintain my training - what my son will allow - to get away for an hour or two here and there. I might have to do a lot of training on the bike at home.\n\"The plan is to enjoy summer, become a father and whatever that throws me.\"\nThe prospect of being South Africa's flagbearer at the Winter Olympics is something that excites Smith, though he is hopeful that others from the country could join him in Italy.\n\"There are currently five active South African athletes in five different disciplines,\" he said.\n\"I very much hope we all qualify, because it would be the largest team we will have ever sent to a [Winter] Games.\n\"I would love to carry the flag but I think the greatest honour is being there and achieving a childhood dream of representing my country in a sport.\n\"It was the Springboks.

In March it announced a collaboration with Patria, a Finnish legacy defence firm, which will trial the tech on its armoured vehicles.\nFinland shares around 1,340 km (830 miles) of its border with Russia, and the Finnish government spent a greater proportion of its budget on defence than many other European countries even before the war in Ukraine.\n\"There's a phrase I like to leverage, which is 'the tyranny of geography' - the closer you are to a threat, the more likely you are to perceive it as more apparent and indeed more existential,\" says Nicholas Nelson, a UK-based defence tech investor and visiting fellow at the University of Oxford.\n\"They also have a memory of the Winter War, which transpired during World War Two, where they were invaded by the Soviet Union.\"\nThe duty of Finns to defend their country is enshrined in the Finnish constitution, and there is mandatory military service for men.\nMr Nelson believes this exposure may also have encouraged talented citizens to become founders or investors in defence tech, rather than other fast-growing industries in Europe such as renewable energy or financial technologies.\nAt Maria 01, a former hospital turned startup campus in Helsinki, entrepreneur Janne Hietala opens his laptop to scroll through images of unmanned airships gathering data above snow-covered Arctic forests. \nHe is the CEO of Kelluu, a company that originally expected its technology to be used by climate researchers, but pivoted to becoming a surveillance platform targeted at cities, governments and research institutions in 2022.\n\"It was a very concrete, personal feeling that we need to also do something for the security situation,\" says Mr Hietala.\nHe highlights national surveys which suggest at least 80% of the Finnish population are prepared to fight for their country, and agrees with Mr Nelson that this \"spirit to be ready to defend\" has trickled into start-up and business strategies, and is likely to fuel the sector's continued growth.\nDefence tech companies launching in Finland have also been boosted by a strong general tech scene in the country.\nMany of the country's tech alumni \u2013 including Mr Toikkanen at Varjo \u2013 honed their skills at Nokia, the former global mobile phone giant which has its roots in Finland. \nIt ran into financial difficulties following the launch of Apple's iPhone in the mid-2000s, but this encouraged a sizable number of former employees to launch or invest in new companies.\nAlthough not as mature as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Helsinki has spawned a handful of unicorn businesses, worth a billion dollars or more, including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura and game developer Supercell.\nThere is also strong state support for the defence tech scene. Last year Business Finland, a government agency that promotes investment and innovation, launched a new defence and digital resilience programme which is directing \u20ac120m towards supporting research and development initiatives from small businesses and startups.\n\"Our current government\u2026 they are really enforcing this kind of public-private collaboration,\" says the programme's director Kirsi Kokko. \"I think they understand the urgency.\"\nDespite the rapid growth of defence tech in Finland, the sector is facing a range of local and European-wide challenges.\nMr Hietala, the founder of airship technology platform Kelluu, describes something of a \"culture clash\" between agile start-ups and large defence companies and governments that have typically required years of experimentation and prototyping before acquiring new technologies.\n\"That's really on the opposite side of the spectrum for start-ups, in which the DNA is that we will fail fast and rapidly, and you don't have every start-up succeed.\"\nAt Business Finland, Ms Kokko says the Nordic nation is also impacted by strong global competition for the software talent needed to grow defence tech and dual use businesses.\nBut while Finland's compact size and long dark winters might put off some potential recruitments, she hopes the nation's reputation for innovation, flat working hierarchies and low crime levels can attract employees with the right skill sets - alongside its success in the sector so far.\n\"We need to have a good story,\" says Kokko. \"And I think we do.\"",

        "article_text": "The bacteria and fungi living on your skin play a surprising role in keeping us healthy. Is it possible to give them a boost?\nScratch the surface of the skin, and you'll find a bustling community of bacteria living there. This is a good thing, as research increasingly shows that having the \"right kind\" of microbes can help keep our skin young, supple, and smooth for longer. Simply by being there, \"good bacteria\" protect us from infection from pathogenic, harmful microbes. They also help to repair wounds and may even counteract some of the harmful effects of UV rays.\u00a0\nAll-the-more reason to look after our skin microbiome. But how do we do this? One method that has become increasingly popular is the use of topical skin probiotics \u2013 which technically means applying live microorganisms to the skin to improve its health.\nAs far back as 1912, scientists were rubbing bacteria into people's faces in an attempt to improve conditions such as acne and seborrhea \u2013 a common form of dermatitis that causes a red, itchy rash and white or yellow scales.\nToday there are dozens of skincare companies selling what they describe as probiotic products, from serums to cleansers and moisturisers. In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it \"renewed\" and \"refreshed\".\nBut while skincare products often claim to be \"probiotic\", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.\nWhat's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as \"cosmetics\" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's difficult to know how effective they are.\u00a0\n\"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent,\" says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\nMost \"probiotic\" skincare products contain either prebiotics \u2013 nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or postbiotics \u2013 proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.\n\"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome,\" says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of\u00a0S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial \"transplants\".\nAccording to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process. Once on the skin there's no guarantee that they'll even take hold, as they must fight to compete with the millions of other microbes already living there.\nThe idea of promoting a healthy skin microbiome is rooted in the theory that bacteria and fungi living on the outside of our body help to protect us from those that might do us harm.\nYet the science behind how certain \"bad\" bacteria can contribute to skin diseases isn't yet fully understood. What we do know is that people with eczema, rosacea, acne and psoriasis all have different types or levels of certain bacteria living on their skin.\n\"What exists at the moment is a lot of papers showing that nearly every skin disease imaginable is associated with a shift in the skin microbiome,\" says Paetzold. \"But this observation just shows an association. It doesn't say that the shift in the microbiome causes that disease. It could also be that the disease changes the skin environment, and that's why the bacterial population changes.\"\nTo prove that a particular strain of bacteria is causing a disease, you would need to either give a healthy person that skin disease by slathering the \"bad bacteria\" on their face, or cure their disease by applying \"good\" bacteria. While the first option is likely to encounter ethical barriers, there are a few researchers attempting the latter.\nThe limited clinical trials that have been published, however, do show promising results. Most focus on using live bacteria to treat eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. They are based on the findings that the skin of people with eczema is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that can often be pathogenic.\n\"One of the big problems in the skin for diseases like eczema, is that certain pathogenic bacteria like S. aureus live on the surface of the skin and cause rashes, cause disease, and cause infection,\" says Gallo, whose own research group has been searching for ways of harnessing the skin microbiome to fight off the harmful bacteria found thriving on eczema patients. \"We mined the bacteria types that usually live on healthy skin looking for bacteria that could produce things that would fight off those bad bacteria\".\nGallo's are focusing on Staphylococcus hominis, a naturally occurring skin bacterium which is present in 21% of healthy people, but only 1% of atopic dermatitis patients.\n\"Our skin provides commensal bacteria like S. hominis with a safe place to live, so some of them have evolved a way of protecting their environment from these bad bacteria that are trying to invade,\" says Gallo.\nIn the case of S. hominis, the bacterium produces anti-microbial peptides \u2013 small fragments of protein \u2013 which directly kill S. aureus. They also produce chemicals called \"autoinducing peptides\", which stop bacterial cells from communicating with one another. Some bacteria like S. aureus signal to one another when their population density reaches a certain level \u2013 a mechanism known as quorum sensing \u2013 triggering the secretion of toxins that can cause skin inflammation. Disrupting that communication can prevent the toxins from being released.\nIn 2021, Gallo's team conducted a phase one randomised controlled trial with 54 adults with atopic dermatitis by applying a cream containing live S. hominis over the course of one week. The results showed that treatment with S. hominis dramatically reduced S. aureus\u00a0colonisation, and even decreased the redness and itch associated with atopic dermatitis in a subgroup of patients compared to a control group given a placebo cream.\nThe findings suggest that using special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier. But more work needs to be done to prove its effectiveness before it can be used as a treatment. The team are now recruiting for a phase two randomised trial which will assess the efficacy of the treatment over a longer 14 week timescale.\u00a0\nElsewhere, other researchers have also had success treating eczema with probiotics. In one 2003 clinical trial, 11 patients with atopic dermatitis were given a cream containing the bacterium\u00a0Streptococcus thermophiles, which they applied for two weeks. The results showed\u00a0that the cream enhanced the skin's production of ceramides \u2013 lipids that help to keep the skin hydrated and maintain it as a healthy barrier.\u00a0\nMore recently, in 2018 10 adults and five children with atopic dermatitis were given a \"microbiome transplant\", where live Roseomonas mucosa bacteria collected from the skin of healthy volunteers was then applied to the skin of the patients twice a week. After 16 weeks, the treatment improved their symptoms by more than 50%.\nAlthough clinical trials focusing on other skin conditions are somewhat rarer, they also show promising results. Acne, for example, is linked to colonisation by the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Some researchers are therefore looking for bacteria that produce antimicrobial peptides to inhibit or kill this bacterium. In one clinical trial, a lotion containing\u00a0the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis\u00a0was given to patients suffering from severe acne. The lotion significantly reduced pustules compared to a placebo lotion.\nPaetzold and his company S-Biomedic, meanwhile, published a clinical trial in 2019 where they gave patients with acne a cream containing specific strains of Cutibacterium acnes. The results showedsome reduction in acne.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why a workout is good for your gut bacteria\n\u2022 The surprising benefits of the microbes living on your skin\n\u2022 How gut bacteria are controlling your brain\nGallo is also researching whether a strain of Staphylococcus capitis bacteria could be an effective acne treatment, with studies in animals showing promising results.\u00a0\n\"The basic mechanism of action is very straightforward. It just inhibits the C. acnes growth, much in the same way that topical antibiotics or oral antibiotics are used to treat acne,\" says Gallo.\u00a0\nUnlike topical antibiotics, however, the treatment specifically targets C. acnes, so the wider skin microbiome is left unharmed, he says.\nGallo's team has even found a specific strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria that produce molecules that may inhibit the development of sun induced skin cancer.\n\"It generates a small molecule that inhibits DNA synthesis in transformed or mutagenic skin cells,\" says Gallo. \"We've found in \nanimal models\n that if these bacteria are present on the surface of mice that undergo UV radiation damage, they get far fewer skin tumours than mice that have the same species of bacteria, but not the genes [in the bacteria] that make this anti-metabolite.\"\nOf course, such a treatment will have to go through much more testing and clinical trials before it can be shown to have a similar effect in humans.\nWhile most studies have looked at treating specific diseases with probiotics, there are also a few that have examined whether pre- or postbiotics could improve skin health generally. For example, some researchers are looking at whether inulin \u2013 a dietary fibre frequently found in cosmetics and personal care products \u2013 could serve as a prebiotic when taken as an oral supplement or applied topically to the skin. Preliminary results suggest that inulin makes the skin more smooth and supple, providing a more favourable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive. Other studies have shown that slapping on sphingomyelinase, an\u00a0enzyme produced by bacteria such as Staphylococcus thermophilus \u2013 which are commonly found in fermented milk products and yogurt \u2013 can boost production of ceramides, which are needed to keep the skin healthy.\nHowever in all cases, large randomised double blind clinical trials \u2013 the gold standard of medical research \u2013 are needed to confirm whether any of these creams are effective.\u00a0\nFor example a recent review study examined all of the data from clinical trials conducted to date and concluded that while \"oral and topical probiotics appear to be effective for the treatment of certain inflammatory skin diseases and demonstrate a promising role in wound healing and skin cancer, more studies are needed to confirm these results\".\u00a0\nGallo agrees that more work is needed but is hopeful about the future of the field.\n\"It's moving in the right direction,\" he says. \"We've come to realise as a field that we need to understand what exactly they're doing, and there's a lot of efforts being put into that, as well as other ways to design microbes to help benefit us. So I'm very optimistic about where we'll be in a few years with probiotics.\"\nHowever for people who don't have a skin disease, but who might want to increase the smoothness of their skin, prevent wrinkles, or boost hydration levels, there is little evidence that probiotic creams readily available in shops will have any benefit.\n\"I think many of the probiotics on the market now don't have very strong evidence behind them, so I wouldn't recommend those necessarily,\" says Gallo. \"You can try them \u2013 but it might not be the best use of your money.\"\nWhile your skin microbiome changes as you age and encounter different environments, there are a few things you can do to help your skin's natural microbiome flourish.\n\"It's a two-way street, because the types of things that we're already doing to moisturise our skin or protect the skin from UV damage are creating an environment that's more hospitable for these beneficial organisms to live in,\" says Gallo.\n\"So normal skin care, appropriate moisturising and cleansing \u2013 all of those things will promote skin health.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Yoon Suk Yeol, who was officially removed from office on Friday, follows a line of former South Korean leaders who have had their reputations marred or terms interrupted by scandal. \nAmong them are presidents who have faced indictment, exile and imprisonment.\nYoon, who was South Korea's public prosecutor, in fact led a probe that landed former president Park Geun-hye in prison. \nNow apart from being impeached, Yoon is also being investigated for treason over his botched martial law attempt last December. Some analysts believe that, ironically, the move was driven by his fear of prosecution. \nHere is a list of former South Korean presidents whose political careers ended dramatically.\nBefore he became South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee spent some three decades as a pro-independence activist against Japanese rule. \nBut his presidency was polarising. \nWhile some respect him for having laid the foundations for a modern country after World War Two, critics condemn his authoritarian streak. Shortly after his inauguration in 1948, he implemented laws to curtail political dissent; he has also been blamed for the killing of civilians during the Korean War. \nThe opposition rejected Rhee's re-election in 1960 and accused him of rigging the vote. This escalated into violent student-led protests, which saw some demonstrators shot dead by police, and ultimately forced Rhee to resign. \nRhee left the country for Hawaii in May that year, where he died in 1965.\nBorn to a poor rural family in the early years of the Japanese occupation, Park Chung-hee joined the military and was posted to Manchuria (a historical region of north-eastern China) where he served until the Japanese surrendered.\nPark led a coup in 1961 to overthrow Rhee's successor, Chang Myon, and later became president. Park led the country for 18 years through a period of rapid economic development known as the \"miracle on the Han river\". It was during this time that the government opened doors to foreign investment, while also helping to develop now-famous conglomerates like Hyundai, LG and Samsung.\nHowever, he moved towards greater authoritarianism later in his term. In 1972, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and made himself \"president for life\". \nDespite Park's economic achievements, South Korea in the 1970s was rocked by growing protests against his iron-fisted rule, where dissenters were brutally punished.\nPark was assassinated at a dinner party in October 1979 by his own spy chief and lifelong friend Kim Jae-kyu. \nMilitary commander Chun Doo-hwan gained power in 1980 after yet another coup. He presided over a brutal military crackdown in the south-western city of Gwangju, which at the time was the centre of an uprising against martial law in South Korea. More than 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were either killed or disappeared.\nDuring Chun's term, the country saw growth rates hovering around 10% each year. However, he is mostly remembered as a dictator who was unapologetic till the end. \nIn 1983, Chun survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by North Korea forces, who bombed a ceremony he was at during a state visit to Myanmar. The attack killed 21 people and injured dozens more. \nIn 1988, Chun picked his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, also a former general, as his successor. \nThe pair were convicted in 1996 of corruption, as well as their roles in the coup and the Gwangju massacre. Defending the coup while on trial, Chun said he \"would take the same action, if the same situation arose\". \nChun was handed a death sentence - which was later commuted to life imprisonment - while Roh was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Both men were pardoned in 1997 after serving just two years in prison.\nBorn to a poor family, Roh Moo-hyun educated himself and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer without having attended law school. He was appointed a judge in 1977 but later left the bench to become a human rights lawyer, where he advocated for student activists accused of being pro-communist.\nIn 2002, Roh won the presidential election as an underdog, with early polls giving him just 2% of the vote. He tried to shape South Korea as a \"middle power\" among other stakeholders in the region, and championed a so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with trade and aid shipments. \nAfter leaving office in 2007, he returned to his hometown in the south-east and ran a duck farm. However, he took his own life 14 months later, as corruption investigators closed in over allegations he accepted $6m in bribes.\nPublic opinion on Roh improved considerably after his death. Polls by Gallup Korea have consistently ranked him the most beloved president in the country's history.\nFormer Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak entered politics in 1992 and was elected mayor of Seoul a decade later. He won the election by a landslide in 2007, even though a business scandal from his days at the automobile conglomerate resurfaced in the days leading up to the vote.\nLee led the country through the global financial crisis and won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. His term ended in 2013, and he was succeeded by the country's first female president Park Geun-hye, who is the daughter of assassinated former leader Park Chung-hee. \nThe younger Park drew on her father's reputation as the man who pulled South Korea out of poverty. However, a corruption scandal involving a confidante, Choi Soon-sil - the daughter of a Shamanistic cult leader - led to her impeachment in 2016 and arrest a year later.\nFive years after leaving office, Lee too was charged with bribery and later found guilty of creating slush funds of tens of millions of dollars, and taking bribes from various sources, including Samsung. \nPark was handed a 22-year sentence and Lee 15 years, but both have since been pardoned.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nSix minutes to come to a clear & obvious decision - Ange on VAR 'lottery'\nTottenham head coach Ange Postecoglou is looking more isolated than ever.\nThe Australian directed a brief clap towards the furious travelling away fans from near the halfway line following his side's 1-0 loss at Chelsea but,  by then, it could be argued the damage had already been done.\nEnzo Fernandez's second-half header was enough to inflict a 16th defeat of the season on Tottenham and leave them 14th in the Premier League - 10 points away from the top 10 - and the signs are growing some fans have had enough.\nChants of \"you don't know what you're doing\" came from the away end after midfielder Lucas Bergvall was replaced by Pape Sarr in the 65th minute. \nRemarkably, Sarr found the net with an excellent long-range strike just four minutes later, leading Postecoglou to cup his ear and turn to the away end, only for VAR to then rule out the goal for a foul on Moises Caicedo. \nWhen asked about the incident after the match, Postecoglou said: \"Jeez mate, it's incredible how things get interpreted. We'd just scored, I just wanted to hear them cheer. Because we'd been through a tough time, and I thought it was a cracking goal. \n\"I wanted them to get really excited. I felt at that point we could potentially go on and win the game. I just felt momentum was on our [side]. It doesn't bother me. It's not the first time they've booed my substitutions or my decisions. That's fine, they're allowed to do that. \n\"But we'd just scored a goal, just scored an equaliser, I was just hoping we could get some excitement. If people want to read into that that somehow I'm trying to make a point about something, like I said, we'd been through a tough time, but I just felt there was a bit of a momentum shift there. \n\"If they get really behind the lads, I thought we had the momentum to finish on top of them.\"\nIt's just the latest in a season of incidents between Postecoglou and sections of the fanbase.\nThere was the recent exchange with an angry supporter after defeat by Fulham just before the international break, another similar back and forth happened after defeat at home to Leicester and he confronted the away end after they criticised players after losing at Bournemouth in December.\nHe added when asked if he was alienating the fans: \"You know what, I am at such a disconnect with the world these days, that who knows? Maybe you're right. I don't know. But that's not what my intention was.\"\nThis just compounds the lack of progress on the pitch, especially with almost a full squad of players available, as Spurs look to avoid their worst season in the Premier League era.\nFormer Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp put it plainly when he said on Sky Sports: \"Tottenham were awful. It could have been so much more. Not good enough in any department from Tottenham. Chelsea were so much better.\n\"When Sarr scored, it looked like Ange cupped his ears to say: I know better. There's a disconnect between the two [Tottenham fans and Ange Postecoglou] at the moment. \n\"It's not ideal for the manager. He's got some big games ahead. He's got to keep his head up, got to keep going, working hard and believing in what they do.\"\nHow does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nPostecoglou hopes Pochettino gets Spurs return\nChelsea boost top-four hopes to pile pressure on Postecoglou\nThis video can not be played\nThe game will be refereed by AI soon - Postecoglou\nPostecoglou is the first Spurs manager to lose his first four matches against Chelsea, while they have fewer points in London derbies this season than any of their neighbours - and the bigger picture offers no solace. \nWith eight games left, Spurs are 14th, and could well finish outside the top 10 for the first time in 17 years. They are now battling to avoid their worst season in the Premier League era.\nTottenham's lowest Premier League finish remains 15th in 1994 under manager Ossie Ardiles - when survival was only ensured in their penultimate match.\nThey have now lost 16 league games this season - their record in a 20-team league is 19, set in 2003-04.\nSince the Premier League's inception in 1992, only six times have Spurs lost 16 or more league matches in a campaign.\nSpurs' lowest points tally in a Premier League season - and in fact since three points for a win was introduced in 1981 - is 44. They need 11 points from their final eight games to pass that tally. \nWith 16 defeats in 30 matches, Spurs' loss percentage this season is 53% - and they haven't lost more than half of their league matches over a whole season since 1934-35. They lost exactly half of their league matches in 1953-94, 1974-75, 1976-77 - when they were relegated - and 2003-04.\nPostecoglou has only won 44 points from his past 39 league matches in charge - stretching back over the end of last season. \nReports suggest Postecoglou is under severe pressure. Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Fulham's Marco Silva and Brentford's Thomas Frank have all been linked with his job.\nThe 56-year-old, who became Spurs boss in June 2023 and is contracted to the club until 2027, even suggested in midweek there were plenty of outstanding candidates, external to replace him.\nHowever, Spurs are expected to at least wait until the culmination of the Europa League campaign - a chance not only to win a first trophy in 17 years, but also to qualify for next season's Champions League. They host Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their quarter-final next Thursday.\nA club source indicated before the match that they weren't expecting any managerial changes before the end of the season. \nRedknapp, again speaking to Sky Sports, said after the match: \"I think for Ange Postecoglou, it feels like he's going to make history or be history.\n\"When you lose 16 games in a season as Tottenham manager, still having great players at your disposal, it's not going to wash with the fans. The performances haven't been good enough.\n\"If they can win some silverware, it'll be unbelievable for them.\"\nVice-captain James Maddison, reacting to the fan frustration, said: \"They have every right to be an angry bunch at the moment.\n\"I don't really want to be here talking and I'm sure the fans don't want to listen to me. It can still be a very special season if we lift silverware. We need them as much as they need us, so the message is to stick together.\"\nLike Postecoglou, chairman and co-owner Daniel Levy has faced criticism from the fans.\nBut Levy has given the head coach resources to shape a squad. Postecoglou has spent \u00a3214.8m, with the most recent arrivals signed in January - forward Mathys Tel, defender Kevin Danso and goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky. \nThat extra spend was an attempt to salvage the season while alive in three cup competitions, but after elimination from the domestic cups, it is Europa League or bust. \nIt will be Spurs' last chance to live up to Postecoglou's comment early in the campaign that he \"always wins a trophy in his second season\" - having done so in Scotland, Japan and Australia.\nWith little to play for in the Premier League, a end to the Spurs trophy drought would end the season on a high.\nOn another night, Postecoglou's post-match rant about VAR would have taken the headlines. On Thursday, it was a footnote.\nTottenham thought they had equalised when Sarr struck home from distance.\nThe celebrations followed but were cut short as VAR checked for a possible foul. After a lengthy delay, the goal was ruled out.\nPostecoglou told BBC Radio 5 Live he \"hated VAR to his core\", that there was no point in having referees - and that there would soon be AI officials.\nPostecoglou, who has often criticised VAR, become embroiled in a lively post-match interview with Sky Sports.\nHere is what he said in full:\n\"It's killing the game, mate. It's not the same game it used to be. \n\"We all sat on our couches last night and watched TV [when Everton's James Tarkowski was not sent off for a high challenge on Liverpool's Alexis Mac Allister] and I guarantee you if Jarred Gillett was VAR last night, it would've been a different outcome, so you just don't know what we're going to get.\n\"You are standing around for 12 minutes. It's just killing the game, but no-one cares about that. They just love the drama and controversy and I'm sure there will be 24 hours of discussion about it and that's what everyone wants - they're not really interested that it's killing the spectacle of the game.\n\"If a referee sees that and he needs to see it for six minutes, what's clear and obvious about it?\n\"Last night we were all sat on our couches and saw one replay and thought: 'Oh my God.'\n\"Tonight we sat there and were waiting for six minutes for something that VAR official Jarred Gillett thought was clear and obvious - it's crazy, it's madness. \n\"We accept it and have to take the fall out from it.

They are now battling to avoid their worst season in the Premier League era.Tottenham's lowest Premier League finish remains 15th in 1994 under manager Ossie Ardiles - when survival was only ensured in their penultimate match.They have now lost 16 league games this season - their record in a 20-team league is 19, set in 2003-04.Since the Premier League's inception in 1992, only six times have Spurs lost 16 or more league matches in a campaign.Spurs' lowest points tally in a Premier League season - and in fact since three points for a win was introduced in 1981 - is 44. \"When you lose 16 games in a season as Tottenham manager, still having great players at your disposal, it's not going to wash with the fans. 'It's killing the game, mate' - VAR upsets PostecoglouOn another night, Postecoglou's post-match rant about VAR would have taken the headlines.",

        "article_text": "It may be that zoo animals are so well cared for they develop allergies as a side effect.\nIn 2018, staff at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago began to notice something unusual about a male polar bear named Siku. He was losing hair, revealing patches of black skin underneath. Evidently itchy, he was scratching and rubbing himself against his enclosure. Kathryn Gamble, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine, had a hunch what was wrong: allergies.\nBut what would a polar bear be allergic to? Gamble and her colleagues anaesthetized Siku and conducted a skin test, injecting small amounts of various allergy-provoking substances into his skin. Siku's skin reacted against house mites, as well as elm, mulberry and red cedar pollen. Oddly enough, \"one of the things that he initially showed a very strong response to on his skin was actually human hair dander\", Gamble recalls.\nWe often think that allergies only afflict people, but a broad range of other animals can also develop them. That includes pet dogs and cats \u2013 in which experts say allergies are on the rise \u2013 but also everything from rhinoceroses, bats, dolphins to chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Lincoln Park Zoo staff say they have seen allergy-afflicted black leopards, fennec foxes, saki monkeys, Japanese macaques and black bears.\nFortunately for itchy animals living in captivity like Siku, animal allergies are treatable, just like in humans. But these cases may also tell us something deeper about how and why allergies develop.\nScientists speculate that animals get allergies for similar reasons as people in many Western countries \u2013 especially those living in cities \u2013 who are currently experiencing a rise in allergies.\nSome experts blame the fact that pets, as well as farm and zoo animals, are increasingly being raised in manmade environments where they're less exposed to the parasites, microbes and other pathogens that they evolved with, causing their immune system to go awry.\u00a0\n\"In dogs and cats, the numbers definitely have gone up, as the numbers in people have gone up,\" says Annette Petersen, a veterinary dermatologist at Michigan State University. \"I wouldn't be surprised if more zoo animals [are getting] allergies too,\" she adds \u2013 although no research has yet looked into whether or not this is the case.\u00a0\u00a0\nAllergy symptoms can vary across animals. Humans and other primates that inhale allergy-causing substances through the nose often develop hay fever-type symptoms, with discharge, sneezing and weepy eyes. But most animals absorb allergy-provoking substances through the skin and develop skin conditions, says Andrew Rosenberg, a veterinary dermatologist and director of medical operations at the Animal Dermatology Group, a US-based veterinary company.\nThe cats Rosenberg sees will often scratch their face and neck, tear out hair, or develop pink plaques or crusted pimples on their bodies. Allergic dogs will lick itchy paws and scratch at armpits and groin areas \u2013 and tend to develop ear infections. Horses can break out in hives. Occasionally, Rosenberg also sees allergic zoo animals \u2013 like the itchy female rhinoceros and her calf from New York's Bronx Zoo that developed severe rashes, bloody ulcerations and weeping infections.\u00a0 \u00a0\nPut simply, allergies occur when the immune system \u2013 which is supposed to protect us from harmful parasites, bacteria or viruses \u2013 mistakenly produces an exaggerated response to harmless substances, like peanuts or pollen.\nIt's unclear what exactly is causing the current rise in allergies among people. While some experts used to solely blame the fact that humans are increasingly growing up in cleaner, more hygienic environments where they're less exposed to microbes than in the wild, research is now pointing to a wider set of factors that also involves the loss of important microbes and parasites that live in and on our bodies, says Andrea Graham, a parasitologist at Princeton University.\nFrequent cleaning and soaps likely contributes to our reduced exposure to these organisms, alongside the use of antibiotic drugs and ointments, greater distancing from domesticated animals and parasite-free food, Graham says. (People can take some steps to help reduce the likelihood of allergies, however \u2013 read more about\u00a0the habits that help prevent allergies here).\nThe loss of certain parasites and microbes in our guts may be particularly consequential; scientists believe that these used to play an important role in our biology by suppressing and modulating our immune system in order to avoid being attacked by it, says Graham. Now, without these organisms to rein in and train our immune response, our immune system is more likely to go into overdrive, including against harmless pathogens, she adds.\nScientists also believe that early childhood exposure to microbes and parasites is especially important for training the immune system to correctly discriminate between harmful and harmless substances and mount an appropriate response. \"Early life is really important for getting the tuning of your immune system right,\" Graham says.\nSome of the best evidence for this theory comes from studies of Amish populations in the US. One 2016 study compared Amish children in Indiana state, who use traditional farming practices and are exposed to lots of microbes through interactions with farm animals and house dust, with children from Hutterite communities in South Dakota, who use highly industrialised farming practices and live in households less exposed to dust and animals. Though both populations were genetically very similar, \"the rate of allergies was about four times higher in the Hutterites who had taken on modern industrial farming\", says Andrew Flies, an immunologist at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research.\nFlies, Petersen, Graham and Rosenberg all suspect that animals kept in households, farms and zoos might develop allergies for similar reasons. They typically get dewormed and vaccinated to prevent infections, and are generally less exposed to the bacteria and parasites they evolved with compared to their relatives in the wild, Graham says.\nFor zoo animals, Petersen says, \"the food they're eating is parasite-free and probably not heavily bacterially contaminated\". Compare that to a bacteria-smothered cadaver a lion would eat in the Serengeti, probably together with the prey's microbe- and parasite-containing guts.\u00a0\nIn other words, it may be that animals are so well cared for in zoos they develop allergies as a side effect.\nWhile no-one has yet published a specific study looking into this, Flies and others suspect that allergies are much more common in these more human environments than in the wilderness. In the wild, allergies might affect the survival of animals \u2013 for instance if allergic animals scratch themselves and develop infections, Flies says. Petersen recalls a lion with allergies she once treated who had developed a bad ear infection. \"If he can't hear well in the wild \u2013 if the ears are plugged with pus and stuff from the infection \u2013 that would obviously be a major disadvantage,\" she says. For these reasons, allergies may have disappeared from wild populations.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut that theory is tough to prove. Animals in the wild may well have allergies, Gamble says \u2013 but we would be less likely to spot them.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat may have contributed to Siku's allergies, Gamble adds, is the fact that he had been moved to Chicago two years before he started developing them. Often, \"if a person moves to a new environment where they're exposed to pollens that their bodies have never seen before, they have a response to it,\" she says.\nOther factors may also be contributing to allergies in animals. Rosenberg says that in his clinic in the northeastern US, where he's seen rising cases of pet allergies, this may be linked to climate change, which is causing higher pollen counts and longer allergy seasons. \"It's my impression that we're seeing more common allergies and we're seeing more severe allergies than ever before,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\u2022 Mud, water and wood: The system that kept a 1604-year-old city afloat\nAs awareness around animal allergies is growing, so is knowledge on how to treat them. Rosenberg was able to treat the allergic rhinoceroses with an approach similar to allergy shots in people, injecting them with small doses of the allergy-provoking substances and gradually dialling up the dose to teach their immune systems that they don't represent a threat and to lessen their response.\nSiku the polar bear received a similar treatment, receiving a combination of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey \u2013 the licking of which helped the substances get absorbed through the soft tissues in his mouth. Honey has the added benefit of containing some local pollen itself, Gamble adds. And sure enough, during another allergy test 36 months after the treatment, Siku was much less reactive to the substances he had previously been allergic to \u2013 including human hair dander.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFor a long time, studies of animals have been used to better understand health conditions in people, but allergies are a rare case where lessons learned in humans may help animals, Flies says.\nOne lesson is the value of being exposed to a rich community of microorganisms. As many people turn to yoghurts and other probiotics for their health benefits, including a reduction in allergies, perhaps researchers can find ways to do the same for zoo animals, farm animals and pets at risk of developing allergies, says Graham.\n\"I'm hopeful that more and more people will study it because I do think we're still battling against this idea that 'clean' is always healthier.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

This is a reference to an honorary award from Coventry University and is not an academic or medical qualification.\nA spokeswoman for Sentebale told the BBC that the use of \"Dr\" was a \"matter of personal choice\" and there was \"no legal restriction preventing honorary degree recipients from using the title\".\nA Sentebale spokeswoman rejected the claim that \u00a3500,000 had been spent on US consultants - and defended its approach to seeking new funds for a charity.\nThe charity told the BBC that it had hired a US firm called Lebec to help build a new fundraising strategy, and that by October 2024 a team of six consultants had set up 65 key relationships with potential donors, who might help Sentebale in the future.\nIt said the 12-month deal with Lebec, a women-led strategy firm, had successfully delivered links to \"high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporations, foundations and partner non-profits\".\n\"Lebec provided the positioning strategy, the tools, and the insights to enter the US market successfully and with credibility,\" said a spokeswoman for Sentebale.\nThe shift to larger-scale US funding would appear to be a different style of approach from Sentebale's fundraising polo matches and celebrity events associated with Prince Harry.\nPrince Harry, his co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and trustees resigned from their roles at Sentebale, as a \"result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board\".\nThey left a charity which was set up in 2006 to help young people in southern Africa living with HIV and Aids, a project which had strong emotional ties for Prince Harry and the legacy of his mother Princess Diana.\nPrince Harry and Prince Seeiso said they were resigning from the charity with \"heavy hearts\".\nInsiders say that relationships had been \"fraught\" by last autumn.\nThe trustees' walkout followed Ms Chandauka's refusal to step down as chair - and she responded with her own claims against her former colleagues.\nShe accused Prince Harry of trying to oust her and said she had raised her concerns with the Charity Commission, with a \"whistleblower complaint about the bullying, the harassment and the misogyny\".\nMs Chandauka argued that the controversy around Prince Harry leaving the UK had meant that he had become a barrier to funding from donors.\n\"It was pretty obvious to me that we had lost quite a number of corporate sponsors,\" she said in a Sky News interview.\nMs Chandauka also spoke about a dispute over a video at a fundraising polo match, where it had been claimed the Duchess of Sussex was manoeuvring her out of the way during a prize giving.\nThe body language seemed to be a sign of other tensions.\n\"Prince Harry asked me to issue some sort of a statement in support of the duchess and I said I wouldn't,\" said Ms Chandauka, who said she did not want the charity to be used as an extension of the publicity for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\nThere were other tussles over whether Prince Harry had caused disruption by wanting to bring a Netflix TV crew to a fundraising event.\nBut sources close to those who have left the charity do not accept that version of events.\nIf the Charity Commission announces it is going ahead with a \"regulatory compliance case\", it will gather evidence about the claims over how Sentebale has been managed and will decide whether the investigation needs to be escalated to the next level of a statutory inquiry.\nMs Chandauka has argued that the charity can continue without its founders and needs to change its focus to reflect the current needs in southern Africa. A friend of Prince Harry's says he feels as though \"he's had one of his fingers cut off\".\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

This is a reference to an honorary award from Coventry University and is not an academic or medical qualification.A spokeswoman for Sentebale told the BBC that the use of \"Dr\" was a \"matter of personal choice\" and there was \"no legal restriction preventing honorary degree recipients from using the title\".A Sentebale spokeswoman rejected the claim that \u00a3500,000 had been spent on US consultants - and defended its approach to seeking new funds for a charity.The charity told the BBC that it had hired a US firm called Lebec to help build a new fundraising strategy, and that by October 2024 a team of six consultants had set up 65 key relationships with potential donors, who might help Sentebale in the future.It said the 12-month deal with Lebec, a women-led strategy firm, had successfully delivered links to \"high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporations, foundations and partner non-profits\".Getty ImagesSophie Chandauka has rejected attempts to remove her as the charity's head\"Lebec provided the positioning strategy, the tools, and the insights to enter the US market successfully and with credibility,\" said a spokeswoman for Sentebale.The shift to larger-scale US funding would appear to be a different style of approach from Sentebale's fundraising polo matches and celebrity events associated with Prince Harry.Prince Harry, his co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and trustees resigned from their roles at Sentebale, as a \"result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board\".They left a charity which was set up in 2006 to help young people in southern Africa living with HIV and Aids, a project which had strong emotional ties for Prince Harry and the legacy of his mother Princess Diana.Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso said they were resigning from the charity with \"heavy hearts\".Insiders say that relationships had been \"fraught\" by last autumn.The trustees' walkout followed Ms Chandauka's refusal to step down as chair - and she responded with her own claims against her former colleagues.She accused Prince Harry of trying to oust her and said she had raised her concerns with the Charity Commission, with a \"whistleblower complaint about the bullying, the harassment and the misogyny\".Ms Chandauka argued that the controversy around Prince Harry leaving the UK had meant that he had become a barrier to funding from donors. \"Prince Harry asked me to issue some sort of a statement in support of the duchess and I said I wouldn't,\" said Ms Chandauka, who said she did not want the charity to be used as an extension of the publicity for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.There were other tussles over whether Prince Harry had caused disruption by wanting to bring a Netflix TV crew to a fundraising event.But sources close to those who have left the charity do not accept that version of events.If the Charity Commission announces it is going ahead with a \"regulatory compliance case\", it will gather evidence about the claims over how Sentebale has been managed and will decide whether the investigation needs to be escalated to the next level of a statutory inquiry.Ms Chandauka has argued that the charity can continue without its founders and needs to change its focus to reflect the current needs in southern Africa. \"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" said a statement from those trustees leaving the charity.Among the likely claims are that \u00a3500,000 of Sentebale's money was spent on consultants in a strategy to get donations from wealthy individuals and foundations in the US, but which sources close to former trustees say had not delivered results.Insiders say that if the US fundraising strategy had worked this crisis in running the charity might have been averted.Ms Chandauka has widely used the title \"Dr\" both for the Sentebale charity and other business settings.

Trump has generally taken a friendlier approach to Russia since his return to the White House.\nHe has made ending the war a priority and a top Russian official is in Washington this week for meetings with his administration, as negotiations continue on a deal.\nLast month, Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on countries buying Russian oil if Russian President Vladimir Putin did not agree to a ceasefire.\nOn Thursday, Russian media also argued that their country was not on the sweeping tariffs list because of existing sanctions.\n\"No tariffs have been imposed on Russia, but that's not because of some special treatment. It's simply because Western sanctions are already in place against our country,\" says state-run Rossiya 24 TV.\nAccording to its sister channel Rossiya 1, Russia is missing from the list \"to the disappointment of many in the West\".\nMany Kremlin-controlled media outlets have specifically referred to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who told Fox News: \"Russia and Belarus, we don't trade with. They're sanctioned.\"\nAccording to the Office of the US Trade Representative, the US imported goods from Russia worth $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) in 2024.

        "article_text": "Wearing a laboratory coat and thin silver gloves, production specialist Jose Barrientos is painstakingly piecing together a white-framed goggle-like headset.\nIt includes multiple cameras, eye-tracking technologies and electronics that work together to simulate scenarios from high stakes military operations.\n\"Everything has to be perfect,\" says the production specialist. \"So many different things can affect other things that can affect the final product in such a massive, massive way.\"\nMr Barrientos works for Varjo, one of a growing number of companies in Finland developing innovations that can assist military forces and governments in preparing for or reacting to conflict.\nThe Nordic nation, with a population of just five million, has 368 defence tech companies, according to research for Tesi, a state-funded venture capital company, released last September.\nAround 40% of these are start-ups and scale-ups, with many growing at rates of 30% to 40% if their tools are dual-use technologies that can also be used in other industries.\nHelsinki is now among the top five cities in Europe for defence, security and resilience investments, according to a separate report released in February by tech data platform Dealroom, in collaboration with the Nato Innovation Fund, an independent venture capital fund launched in 2023 with funding from 24 Nato allies.\nVarjo says its headsets are being used to provide 80 simulation programmes to Nato forces in the US and Europe.\nIn simple terms, its products are more advanced versions of the virtual reality headsets used in gaming.\nBut they combine synthetic artificial content with views of real-world environments.\nThis \"mixed reality\" experience \"squeezes the training continuum\" for fighter pilots, says the firm's CEO Timo Toikkanen, because they no longer have to travel long distances to complete war simulations in giant aircraft hangers, which are expensive to power and run. \"You can do 99% of the same [training] inside of the headset.\"\nThe start-up had already attracted heavy investment prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and started working with medical research companies and car manufacturers.\nBut Mr Toikkanen says the start of the conflict and Finland's admission to Nato a year later \"just kind of put everything on steroids\" in terms of interest in its defence offering.\nSince March 2022 the company has raised more than \u20ac50m (\u00a342m; $54m) in additional funding. \nMr Toikkanen says that before the war technologies that could be used by military forces used to be \"kind of a red flag\" for investors concerned about social and environmental responsibilities, and Varjo's executives would \"tiptoe around\" that side of the business when seeking funding.\nNow the opposite is now true.\n\"Investors are looking for companies that are active in the field of defence technology and it's not frowned upon anymore,\" he explains. \nFollowing President Trump's return to office in January, Mr Toikkanen says there's been a renewed interest in its products from European militaries in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions.\n\"Suddenly, there's a new understanding that we need to prepare, and we can't only rely on Nato and the United States for our defence.\"\nListen: Business Daily - Finland's Defence Tech\nOther rapidly expanding Finnish start-ups in the defence and dual-use sectors include Iceye, which has developed fine-resolution microsatellite-based imaging and data services, and Re-orbit which supplies satellite software.\nDistance Technologies, a start-up backed by Google creates headset-free immersive technologies. In March it announced a collaboration with Patria, a Finnish legacy defence firm, which will trial the tech on its armoured vehicles.\nFinland shares around 1,340 km (830 miles) of its border with Russia, and the Finnish government spent a greater proportion of its budget on defence than many other European countries even before the war in Ukraine.\n\"There's a phrase I like to leverage, which is 'the tyranny of geography' - the closer you are to a threat, the more likely you are to perceive it as more apparent and indeed more existential,\" says Nicholas Nelson, a UK-based defence tech investor and visiting fellow at the University of Oxford.\n\"They also have a memory of the Winter War, which transpired during World War Two, where they were invaded by the Soviet Union.\"\nThe duty of Finns to defend their country is enshrined in the Finnish constitution, and there is mandatory military service for men.\nMr Nelson believes this exposure may also have encouraged talented citizens to become founders or investors in defence tech, rather than other fast-growing industries in Europe such as renewable energy or financial technologies.\nAt Maria 01, a former hospital turned startup campus in Helsinki, entrepreneur Janne Hietala opens his laptop to scroll through images of unmanned airships gathering data above snow-covered Arctic forests. \nHe is the CEO of Kelluu, a company that originally expected its technology to be used by climate researchers, but pivoted to becoming a surveillance platform targeted at cities, governments and research institutions in 2022.\n\"It was a very concrete, personal feeling that we need to also do something for the security situation,\" says Mr Hietala.\nHe highlights national surveys which suggest at least 80% of the Finnish population are prepared to fight for their country, and agrees with Mr Nelson that this \"spirit to be ready to defend\" has trickled into start-up and business strategies, and is likely to fuel the sector's continued growth.\nDefence tech companies launching in Finland have also been boosted by a strong general tech scene in the country.\nMany of the country's tech alumni \u2013 including Mr Toikkanen at Varjo \u2013 honed their skills at Nokia, the former global mobile phone giant which has its roots in Finland. \nIt ran into financial difficulties following the launch of Apple's iPhone in the mid-2000s, but this encouraged a sizable number of former employees to launch or invest in new companies.\nAlthough not as mature as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Helsinki has spawned a handful of unicorn businesses, worth a billion dollars or more, including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura and game developer Supercell.\nThere is also strong state support for the defence tech scene. Last year Business Finland, a government agency that promotes investment and innovation, launched a new defence and digital resilience programme which is directing \u20ac120m towards supporting research and development initiatives from small businesses and startups.\n\"Our current government\u2026 they are really enforcing this kind of public-private collaboration,\" says the programme's director Kirsi Kokko. \"I think they understand the urgency.\"\nDespite the rapid growth of defence tech in Finland, the sector is facing a range of local and European-wide challenges.\nMr Hietala, the founder of airship technology platform Kelluu, describes something of a \"culture clash\" between agile start-ups and large defence companies and governments that have typically required years of experimentation and prototyping before acquiring new technologies.\n\"That's really on the opposite side of the spectrum for start-ups, in which the DNA is that we will fail fast and rapidly, and you don't have every start-up succeed.\"\nAt Business Finland, Ms Kokko says the Nordic nation is also impacted by strong global competition for the software talent needed to grow defence tech and dual use businesses.\nBut while Finland's compact size and long dark winters might put off some potential recruitments, she hopes the nation's reputation for innovation, flat working hierarchies and low crime levels can attract employees with the right skill sets - alongside its success in the sector so far.\n\"We need to have a good story,\" says Kokko. \"And I think we do.\"",

        "article_text": "Red Bull's driver Yuki Tsunoda talks us through the must-see places in Tokyo ahead of his home race at the Japanese Grand Prix.\nWhenever Yuki Tsunoda returns to fast and furious Tokyo after months of (literally) racing around the globe, it's the city's bountiful food options that help remind him he's home.\nThe SpeciaList\nFormula 1 driver Yuki Tsunoda, the youngest ever Japanese F1 driver, began his career at AlphaTauri in the 2021 season. He has driven 90 races for the team, which rebranded as RB at the start of the 2024 campaign. At the 2024 Japanese Grand Prix, he became the first homegrown racer to score a point at the Suzuka Circuit since 2012.\n\"When I'm back I always make a detailed plan of where I'm going to eat,\" declares the young Red Bull driver; known for being one of Formula 1's biggest foodies. \"On every single street and every single block there are so many great restaurants. The competition for food is so high as currently Tokyo has the highest concentration of Michelin star restaurants in the world.\nA native of Sagamihara city, around 47km south-west of Tokyo, Tsunoda \u2013 who now lives in Faenza, Italy \u2013 heads straight to Tokyo whenever he's back in Japan.\u00a0 \"Even when I return to Japan now, which happens around three times a year, I normally stay in Tokyo,\" he says. \"That's where I can do business, enjoy the food and experience the nightlife. It's always so fun to be back there.\"\u00a0\nEach April, Tsunoda's return to Tokyo is particularly triumphant when he races in his home Grand Prix. For Tsunoda, what separates the Japanese Grand Prix from the other tracks is the scintillating and contagious atmosphere, which he insists he \"can feel in the car\". Every time Tsunoda emerges at the Suzuka Circuit, he's greeted with a tidal wave of cheers and support that only increases when he's in the car and racing around the circuit.\nThe excitement was particularly vibrant at the 2024 Japanese Grand Prix, when he finished 10th to become the first Japanese drive to score points since 2012. \"As soon as I got out of the car, I could see so many people were happy,\" he says. \"With that kind of support, you just feel like a hero. You also feel extra pressure too, and responsibility. But it's a special feeling.\"\nAfter the race, Tsunoda had no shortage of ways to celebrate. As the world's most populous metropolitan area, home to more than 41 million residents as of 2024, Tokyo is constantly abuzz with energy and excitement. Visitors (and locals) get lost in its bustling markets and bask in its futuristic, neon-lit shopping and nightlife sectors, while the city's many parks, gardens and ancient temples mean there's also room for contemplation and self-reflection.\u00a0\nHere are Tsunoda's top ways to enjoy Tokyo \u2013 off the grid.\nThe city now known as Tokyo began life as a small fishing village called Edo, inhabited since ancient times. Today, its centuries of rich history are proudly on display in its captivating backdrop of modern skyscrapers set against historic temples. Each of the city's 23 wards offers unique sights \u2013 like youthful, trendy Shibuya with its iconic \"scramble\" street crossing; and Ginza, lined with elegant luxury boutiques.\nTip:\nThe best time of year to visit Tokyo is undeniably the end of March or in April, says Tsunoda. There's one very good reason for that: cherry blossom season. \"They're only around for a very short time, so you need a bit of luck. But the cherry blossom trees bloom across all of Tokyo. It makes the city so beautiful.\" Tsunoda's favourite place to enjoy the sight is down by Meguro River. It's home to a tree-lined path that's more than 4km long; a picturesque and relaxing place to soak up Japan's natural wonder.\nWhen Tsunoda wants to soak up Tokyo's modern-meets-ancient scenery, he heads to Asakusa, a serene neighbourhood known for its traditional charm and for being one of Tokyo's main geisha districts. \"If you want to see the traditional side in Japan, the Sens\u014d-ji temple is so nice,\" says Tsunoda. Known for its majestic Hozomon Gate, Sens\u014d-ji is the oldest temple in Tokyo; a five-storey pagoda and Buddhist place of worship that instantly transports you to 7th-Century Japan. Visitors to Asakusa can also stroll down Nakamise-dori; one of Japan's oldest shopping streets.\nAnd for a mile-high view of the city, Tsunoda suggests visiting Tokyo Skytree. The tallest freestanding tower in the world at 634m, Tokyo Skytree offers stunning, all-encompassing views of Tokyo and beyond. \"It's the highest building in Tokyo and you can see the whole city from there,\" says Tsunoda. Visitors can also enjoy the mammoth tower's 300-plus shops and restaurants. Reserving a ticket in advance is strongly recommended to avoid queues.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.senso-ji.jp/english/\nAddress: 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0032Phone: +81 3-3842-0181 \nWebsite: \nhttps://tokyo-skytree.net/\nAddress: 1 Chome-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida City, Tokyo 131-0045, Japan\nPhone: +81 570-550-634\nInstagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tokyoskytree_official\nWhenever he's in Tokyo, Tsunoda always hits Osoba no Kouga in Minato City for their soba (buckwheat) noodles. Helmed by Hiroshi Kouga \u2013 who has been making soba for more than 20 years \u2013 the elegant space remains one of Tokyo's most affordable Michelin-starred soba noodle shops.\u00a0\nTsunoda also insists that visitors try wagyu steak when they're in Tokyo. Translating to \"Japanese cow\", wagyu is globally regarded as premium beef for its flavour and tenderness, made rich and juicy by the distinctive marbling pattern of fat. Tsunoda insists, \"Wagyu just tastes different when it's from a cow fed in Japan.\"\u00a0\nTsunoda's favourite place to enjoy wagyu steak is Ukai-Tei in the upscale Ginza district, lauded for its opulent mixture of Art Noveau and Japanese design. Watching its chefs prepare dishes on a teppan grill adds to the entertainment factor.\nWebsite: \nhttps://osobanokouga.com/\nAddress: 2-14-5 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106-0031\nPhone Number: +81 3-3797-6860\nSeafood is a staple in Japanese cuisine, taking the starring role in dishes from traditional breakfasts of grilled fish and rice to delicious, rainbow-coloured sushi.\nTip:\nWith sushi restaurants seemingly on every corner, Tsunoda offers this advice when picking one: \"You want to make sure it has a counter table and you can sit there and watch the chef cook right in front of you,\" he says. \"It might be a little more expensive. But it's worth it.\"\u00a0\nFor the best fish in town, Tsunoda heads to Tsukiji Outer Market, locally known as Japan's \"Food Town\". Located next to the historic Tsukiji Market where the city's famous tuna auctions were held for decades, the lively market is crammed with stalls selling the freshest seafood. Some of the city's most famous restaurants come here to get their fish, but the market is also packed to the brim with hole-in-the-wall spots where you can snack on some of Japan's most famous foods, like tamagoyaki (omelette on a stick), mochi (glutinous rice cake) and wagyu beef skewers. It's also where Tsunoda says you can find some of Tokyo's best sushi.\u00a0\n\"There are many sushi restaurants at Tsukiji Outer Market,\" he says. \"And since it is a fish market, the fish is very fresh, especially in the morning when you can enjoy it right there\u2026 It's just really great to watch people, walk around the fish market and soak up the atmosphere.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/\nAddress: 104-0045 Tokyo, Chuo City, Tsukiji\nPhone number: +81 3-3541-9444\nInstagram: \n@tsukijicity\n\u00a0\nWith scores of luxury and indie boutiques, Tokyo is a shopper's paradise \u2013 and there are a variety of areas that cater to Tsunoda's eclectic tastes. \"I go to Harajuku when I want more street-style fashion that younger people wear. There's a lot there,\" he says. Located just east of Shibuya, Harajuku \u2013 known as Japan's top fashion district \u2013 is full of colourful street art, while its mass of clothing and cosplay stores, hip bars and alluring dessert shops means it's constantly buzzing with youthful vigour.\nTsunoda's first port of call in Harajuku is GR8, which is home to many of the city's up and coming designers, selling popular clothes and footwear from the US and Europe. Its neon interior and wooden entrance makes it one of the most distinct shops in the city, too. But if Tsunoda is after vintage fashion, he heads to the Shimokitazawa neighbourhood, regarded as one of Tokyo's most bohemian areas, full of music venues, cafes and clothing stores. \"That's where you'll find more casual stuff,\" he says. When in Shimokitazawa, Tsunoda shops at BABE store, a used and vintage clothing shop where you can easily spend hours looking for lost gems amidst its mass of items.\nFor luxury clothes shopping, Tsunoda suggests the very fashionable Omotesando district, sometimes referred to as the Champs-Elysees of the city. \"That's where you get the brand stuff,\" he says. \"The items that are higher in price and where the most famous brands are.\"\nTsunoda likes jumping from store to store in the Tadao Ando-designed Omotesando Hills shopping complex. Home to high-end designer boutiques and imports from across the world, there's also the occasional vintage store and fine dining option, too.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.gr8.jp\nAddress: 4 Chome-12-10 Jingumae, Shibuya, Tokyo 150-0001\nPhone: +81 3-3408-6908\nInstagram: \n@________gr8\nThe one drinking establishment Tsunoda always tries to frequent when he's in town is Bar Centifolia, located in the laid-back Azabu Juban neighbourhood; home to embassies as well as a smattering of bars and restaurants.\u00a0\nThe tiny bar has an exclusive, intimate feel with just 12 seats, and its theatrical bartenders have earned the spot a reputation for doubling as a performance space \u2014 tipplers will witness staff ferociously throwing bottles into the air, using liquid nitrogen and blue fire to create a specific taste and even chopping ice with a katana.\n\"Its bartender Yuzo Komai recently went viral because of the drinks that he makes,\" says Tsunoda. \"A lot of famous people have started going there. A lot of tourists, too. But it's such a nice bar.\" Komai's attention to detail when making cocktails, mixing each drink with surgical precision, recently saw him land the Suntory Cocktail Award Champion, one of the most coveted bartender prizes in the city.\u00a0\nAddress: 6F, 1-6-5 Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku\nPhone Number: +81 3-3478-6228\nInstagram: \n@bar_centifolia\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

I don't comment on any rumours.\"\nThat the publicity-shy Zaluzhnyi, currently Ukraine's ambassador in London, felt the need to issue a statement was striking in itself.\nThe head of Ukraine's Central Election Commission, Oleh Didenko, also chose to speak publicly about the speculation.\nHe told the Ukrainska Pravda news website the law would have to be changed before any elections could take place. He said current rules stated that parliamentary elections must be held 60 days after the lifting of martial law, and 90 days for presidential elections. \nBut more time would be needed because of the war and that would require legal changes.\nThe Economist newspaper claimed Zelensky held a meeting last week to discuss an election and instructed staff to prepare for a vote once the United States had forced Russia into accepting a ceasefire, potentially as early as Easter.\nThis report was denied by several government sources. \n\"There is fake information there,\" one presidential source told BBC News Ukrainian. \"There was no such meeting and there was no such instruction.\"\nThe government source said the main focus was achieving peace and there was little hope of the war ending by Easter.\nSo in the face of so many public denials, why do some still think an election might be in the offing?\nFirst, some sources note Zelensky's support in the polls has picked up since he was harangued by Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in the White House. \nA poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in March suggested the number of Ukrainians who trusted Zelensky was up a couple of points on the previous month at 69%. \nDiplomats say the president might think now was his best chance of winning a second term rather than wait until political divisions emerge after the war.\nSecond, by winning a second term, Zelensky would call Russia's bluff and strengthen his hand in any long-term peace negotiations. Only last week President Vladimir Putin said the United Nations should take over Ukraine and organise a \"democratic presidential election\". His assumption \u2013 perhaps mistaken - is that Zelensky would be replaced.\nThird, martial law must be renewed by parliamentary vote in early May. Zelensky could use that timetable to announce martial law would be allowed to lapse with elections held later in the summer.\nFourth, the Americans are convinced elections are coming. Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, told the Tucker Carlson podcast on March 21: \"They've agreed to it. There will be elections in Ukraine.\" \nZelensky could use this pressure from the US \u2013 echoing Russian narratives \u2013 as a pretext, telling voters he had no choice but to hold elections.\nFifth, some Ukrainian sources believe logistical obstacles to elections can be overcome. \nMillions of citizens are displaced overseas, on the front line and in occupied territories. The answer to that, some say, is to allow people to vote using a smart phone app called Diia. This contains people's core documents such as passport, identity card and drivers' licence. \nUsing Diia, some argue, would allow people to vote quickly, cheaply and safely without having to travel to a polling booth overseas or in the trenches. They point out Ukrainians have used it successfully to vote in the Eurovision Song Contest. They also note President Zelensky gave every Ukrainian almost \u00a320 as a winter allowance last December, with many registering for it using Diia.\nBut there remain many arguments against elections. \nUsing Diia would require new legislation that might struggle to get through parliament. Diia could be vulnerable to cyber-attack and technical failure. Western governments may not consider it trustworthy; Russia certainly would not. \nEven if Diia were used, identifying who could vote would still take time with incomplete and out-of-date registers. \nLifting martial law during a temporary ceasefire could create unexpected consequences \u2013 including the flight of hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the front line \u2013 just as Russia prepared a counterattack. Russia could strike queues of voters at polling stations. \nAny elections, however quickly held, would allow war-time unity to be replaced by political rows. An election would allow Russia to deploy digital and other propaganda to try to shape the result. \nHolding an election may also be seen as accepting Russian arguments that Volodymyr Zelensky's leadership is illegitimate because of the suspended elections last year. \nPerhaps the strongest argument against elections is that Ukrainians themselves do not want them. That same March poll by the KIIS found about 78% of people opposed holding elections even after a complete settlement of the war.",

I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "Hungary's government has announced it is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nThe move was announced by a senior official in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government hours after Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in Hungary for a state visit. \nOrban had invited Netanyahu as soon as the warrant was issued last November, saying the ruling would have \"no effect\" in his country.\nIn November, ICC judges said there were \"reasonable grounds\" that Netanyahu bore \"criminal responsibility\" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the ICC's decision as \"antisemitic\".\nThe ICC, a global court, has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nHungary is a founding member of the ICC, which counts 125 member states, and will be the first European Union nation to pull out of it. A withdrawal has no impact on on-going proceedings. \nThe ICC was a \"respectable initiative\", Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told Hungarian state-owned news agency MTI, but added it had deviated from its original purpose and become a political body.\nHe said the warrant issued against Netanyahu was unacceptable and that the government did not want to participate in the court's work anymore. Hungary's parliament has never proclaimed the ICC's statute, so it is not part of the country's law, Gulyas added.\nIsrael meanwhile has thanked Orban for its \"clear and strong moral stance alongside Israel,\" Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar wrote on X.\n\"The so-called 'International Criminal Court' lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel's right to self-defence,\" Sa'ar added.\nHungary's decision aligns with its broader foreign policy stance under Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Israel and adopted a critical view of international institutions perceived as infringing on national sovereignty.\nWhile Hungary's withdrawal may carry symbolic weight and political implications, it does not significantly alter the ICC's operational capacity or legal framework. \nThe court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support.\nBut Hungary's criticism of the ICC as \"politically biased\" and its decision to withdraw as Netanyahu visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings.\nThe US, Russia, China and North Korea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC, and therefore do not recognise its jurisdiction.\nIsrael is also not part of the treaty, but the ICC ruled in 2021 that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, because the UN's Secretary General had accepted that Palestinians were a member.\nHungary now needs to send written notification to the UN Secretary General to leave the treaty, with the withdrawal taking effect one year later, according to article 127 of the Rome Statute.\nICC spokesman Fad El-Abdullah told the BBC: \"On the visit of Mr Netanyahu, the Court has followed its standard procedures, after the issuance of an arrest warrant. The Court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC.\"\nSince the warrant was issued, Hungarian authorities should technically arrest Netanyahu and hand him over to the court in the Hague, although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants.\nIn Europe, some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country, while others, such as Germany, announced that he would not be detained if he visited.\nThe White House had said the US rejected the ICC decision and Netanyahu has visited the country since the warrant was issued in November. His visit to Hungary marks Netanyahu's first trip to Europe since then.\nHungarian Defence Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, greeted Netanyahu on the tarmac of Budapest airport on Wednesday night, welcoming him to the country.\nIsrael is appealing against the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and strongly rejects the accusations. It both denies the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants.\nNetanyahu said at the time that it was a \"dark day in the history of humanity\", and that the ICC had become \"the enemy of humanity\".\n\"It's an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us,\" he said.\nIn the same ruling, ICC judges also issued a warrant against Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, whom Israel says is dead.\nThe visit comes as Israel announced it was expanding its Gaza offensive and establishing a new military corridor to put pressure on Hamas, as deadly Israeli strikes were reported across the Palestinian territory.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered by the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and led to 251 hostages being taken to Gaza. Since then, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, Palestinian health authorities say.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced and imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US.\nOn Wednesday, Trump declared a national economic emergency and announced tariffs on goods from every country of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. The 10% tariffs will take effect on 5 April, and the higher ones on 9 April.\nCanada and Mexico are currently exempted from these charges - but they, along with China, were already facing tariffs on some products. And the Trump administration has now expanded existing steel and aluminium tariffs to include beer and empty cans, which could hit both countries hard. \nOn top of that, on Thursday, 25% tariffs on automobiles coming into the US will come into effect. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.\nEconomists have warned these levies - and those introduced in response by other countries - could push prices up for American consumers. \nThat's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.\nSo which things could become more expensive?\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.\nMost analysts estimate that the auto tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the prices of new cars in the US, which reached a record average of $49,738 in December, according to Cox Automotive. As competition for used cars increases, so could the prices paid for them.\nEven for cars made in the US, prices will probably rise.\nMany US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.\nComponent parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.\nThe new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.\nAnderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.\nExperts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.\nPopular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.\nModelo, and many foreign-made beers, will also be affected by the expanded aluminium tariff which will include canned beers starting on 4 April. Most of the beverage in the US - 64.1% - is poured out of cans, according to the Beer Institute.\nMeanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".\nSo, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.\nTrump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.\nThe US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs. \nTrump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".\nHowever, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.\n\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.\nImports from the rest of the world could also be affected. \nOn 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production. \nFindings are due towards the end of 2025.\nCanada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of global production.\nThe majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.\n\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" said Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.\n\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. \nAccording to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.\nWhile the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%. \nThe US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.\n\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.\nThat means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices. \nAvocados thrive in the Mexican climate. \nNearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.\nThe US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.\nRelated dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Acheson",

In many of his viral videos, he can be seen whipping the crowds into a frenzy. \nHe places his hands on his followers who shake and convulse before claiming to be miraculously healed from whatever is ailing them. \nOn Tuesday, after the court pronounced the punishment for Singh in the 2018 rape case, the woman's lawyer, Anil Sagar, hailed the decision, calling it an \"exemplary punishment\".\n\"Any leniency in such cases where people use their social position to rape poor and weak people increases the confidence of predators,\" Mr Sagar said.\nSingh's lawyers have not commented on the verdict.

He has denied both the allegations.\nHis churches have also faced financial scrutiny. In January last year, some of them were investigated by India's income-tax department.\nBorn in Haryana state in a Hindu family, he reportedly converted to Christianity about 15 years ago when he was in prison. Media reports said he was in jail in connection with a murder case, but he has publicly not commented on it. \nOn his website, he claims that \"evil forces\" had pushed him towards a life of crime before someone handed him a Bible and he found God. His website also refers to him as a \"prophet\" and offers \"services\" of healing people with holy oil and water.\nBecause of the various criminal cases against him, he is described as a controversial figure in the media. But his supporters defend him - and Singh himself has previously attributed some of the negative press to \"schemes\" and \"plots\" by rival pastors.",

Some 93 had been shot by the end of 2024.\nThe plans to shoot even more were condemned by conservationists, who said the decision was in violation of international obligations and could be illegal.\n\"It's absurd,\" said Michal Wiezik, an ecologist and MEP for opposition party Progressive Slovakia.\n\"The Environment Ministry failed desperately to limit the number of bear attacks by the unprecedented culling of this protected species,\" he told the BBC.\n\"To cover up their failure, the government has decided to cull even more bears,\" he continued. \nWiezik argued that thousands of encounters a year passed without incident, and he hoped the European Commission would intervene.\nSlovak police confirmed on Wednesday that a man found dead in forest near the town of Detva in Central Slovakia on Sunday night was killed by a bear. His wounds were consistent with an attack.\nThe 59-year-old man had been reported missing on Saturday after failing to return from a walk in the woods. \nHe was found with what authorities described as \"devastating injuries to the head\". Evidence of a bear's den was found nearby, a local NGO told Slovak newspaper Novy Cas.\nBears have become a political issue in Slovakia after a rising number of encounters, including fatal attacks.\nIn March 2024, a 31-year-old Belarusian woman fell into a ravine and died while being chased by a bear in northern Slovakia.\nSeveral weeks later a large brown bear was captured on video running through the centre of the nearby town of Liptovsky Mikolas in broad daylight, bounding past cars and lunging at people on the pavement.\nThe authorities later claimed to have hunted down and killed the animal, although conservationists said later there was clear evidence they had shot a different bear.\nEnvironment Minister Tomas Taraba said on Wednesday there were more than 1,300 bears in Slovakia, and that 800 was a \"sufficient number\", as the population was growing.\nHowever, experts say the population remains more or less stable at around 1,270 animals.\nBears are common across the Carpathian mountain range, which stretches in an arc from Romania through western Ukraine and on to Slovakia and Poland.",
