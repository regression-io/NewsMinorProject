        "article_text": "This story contains details of someone taking their own life, which some readers may find distressing.\nThe family of a Boeing whistleblower who took his own life last year has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company.\nThe complaint alleges that John Barnett was subjected to a campaign of harassment, abuse and humiliation after he raised concerns about safety issues.\nIt claims that the conduct of the company was \"the clear, foreseeable cause\" of Mr Barnett's death.\nBoeing said it was saddened by Mr Barnett's death and extended its condolences to his family.\nThe former Boeing manager was found dead from what police described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the parking lot of a Charleston hotel on 9 March last year.\nThe 146-page lawsuit has been brought by his mother, Vicky Stokes, and his brothers Rodney and Michael on behalf of his estate. It was filed on Wednesday in the US District Court of South Carolina.\nIt attributes his death to Boeing's actions, including what it describes as a retaliatory campaign by his managers that amounted to a \"hostile work environment\".  \n\"Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,\" it says.\nIt describes Mr Barnett as a dedicated, idealistic worker who \"took his role seriously in protecting the flying public\" and \"believed that he had a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure\u2026 that every possible defect was identified, documented and remedied.\"\nIt describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company.\nMr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him.\nAmong the exhibits put forward in support of the claim are an email, in which he says, \"Boeing has completely destroyed my outlook on life\" and his handwritten final note, which says \"I can't do this any longer!! Enough!!\"\nJohn Barnett worked for Boeing for 32 years. \nFrom 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.\nDuring his time at the factory, Mr Barnett raised a number of concerns with management about violations of safety procedures, as well as about defects in aircraft on the production line.\nHe later took his concerns to the media. In 2019, he told the BBC that:\nBoeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.\nIt established that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.\nOn the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly\". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.\nSafety standards at Boeing have come under a harsh spotlight since an incident last year in which a disused door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max aircraft shortly after takeoff. \nThe incident, which came five years after two previous catastrophic accidents involving the 737 Max, brought intense scrutiny of the company's quality control procedures and conditions in the factory. \nThe company appointed a new chief executive last year, industry veteran Kelly Ortberg, and has produced a detailed action plan to address concerns raised by regulators about issues on the factory floor.\nIn response to the lawsuit being filed, Boeing issued a brief statement. \n\"We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family,\" it said.\nPreviously, however, the company has pushed back against the allegations made against it, telling the BBC: \"Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety.\"\nIt also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.\nIt added: \"We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously.\"\nIf you have been affected by the issues in this story, you can find support from the BBC's Action Line.",

        "article_text": "Repeated failures in how CTs, X-rays and other medical scans are being interpreted are leading to avoidable patient deaths and delays in diagnosing cancer, England's health ombudsman has warned. \nThe most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly.\nThe ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again. \nNHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\".\nIn one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO).\nThe man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021. \nA scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel.\nHowever, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery.\nThe patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home. \nLater that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body. \nJust months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain. \nThe ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions. \nFailings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests. \nThe man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen. \n\"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\"\nA statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made. \n\"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\"\nThe trust has also agreed to pay the family \u00a34,000, as recommended by PHSO. \nIn another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise. \nThe patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday. \nHis brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it. \n\"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\"\nThe man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital.\nHowever, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nHe died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous.\nIf the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said.\nWhile the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life.\nHis brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\"\nIn a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident.\n\"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\"\nThe trust has agreed to pay the family \u00a33,500. \nMs Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care. \n\"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\"\nThe 2021 ombudsman report into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\".\nIt is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added.\nDr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements. \n\"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said. \n\"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\"\nThe college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028. \nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\"\nThe spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\".\nChanges were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.",

Their PPDA, a measure of pressing intensity, was 9.8 during his time at the club, the second-best score in the Premier League.\nBut Tuchel is a deep tactical thinker and perhaps too flexible to be anchored to these buzzwords. He is not a 'philosophy' manager wedded to one idea like Ruben Amorim or Ange Postecoglou.\nAt Dortmund he pressed high and hard, only to drop deeper at Chelsea, where he developed a penchant for double number 10s between the lines. At Bayern Munich, tactical fluency never really took hold, yet Tuchel clearly moved towards fast wingers and quick transitions more than in previous jobs.\nEven the formation is open to change.

He also accused the Trump administration of continuing to withhold information from the court.\nTrump hit back at the judge in a Truth Social post later on Thursday.\n\"Judge James Boasberg is doing everything in his power to usurp the Power of the Presidency,\" he wrote.\n\"He is a local, unknown Judge, a Grandstander, looking for publicity, and it cannot be for any other reason, because his \"Rulings\" are so ridiculous, and inept. SAVE AMERICA!\"\nIn another Truth Social post, Trump called for a stop to \"nationwide injunctions\" against his administration's policies, calling such court rulings \"unlawful\".\nHe also said \"our country is in very serious trouble\", urging Chief Justice Roberts and others on the Supreme Court to \"fix this toxic and unprecedented situation immediately\".\nIn the Venezuelan migrants deportation case, government lawyers submitted a six-paragraph declaration from an immigration official.\nThey also told the court they needed another day to consider whether to invoke a state secrets clause that allows federal authorities to withhold sensitive national security information in lawsuits.\nBut Judge Boasberg was not satisfied.\n\"To begin, the Government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to Cabinet-level discussions of the state-secrets privilege,\" he wrote.\nThe judge initially gave a deadline of Wednesday, before extending it to Thursday. Now he has given the Trump administration until Friday morning to provide a sworn declaration from a cabinet-level official.\nJudge Boasberg will also hold a previously scheduled hearing on Friday about Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president last weekend cited the 18th Century measure to deport more than 200 Venezuelans, alleging almost all were members of the gang Tren de Aragua.\nBut an immigration attorney working on behalf of one of the deported men told a court on Thursday that her client was a professional soccer player in Venezuela without a criminal record, CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, reported. \nThe man, Jerce Reyes Barrios, had applied for asylum to escape political persecution, his attorney argued, saying that he was falsely accused of being connected to Tren de Aragua because of a tattoo on his arm. \nThe attorney said the tattoo honoured the football team Real Madrid. \nThe flights - which Mr Barrios and others were aboard - were halted by Judge Boasberg verbally over the weekend. Any flights currently in the air were to be turned back. \nBut the White House said the planes were already in international airspace, arguing that the judge's order was therefore invalid.",

He caught the eye of Benfica scouts and spent two years in their academy before moving closer to home and joining Sporting.\nIn 2023 he signed his first professional contract and, while with the reserve team, caught the eye of ex-Sporting manager Ruben Amorim, who gave him his senior debut in the Portuguese Super Cup at the beginning of this campaign.\nAt just 17 years and 95 days, the Portugal Under-21 international became the club's youngest ever goalscorer with his strike in a 4-3 defeat by Porto.\nQuenda recorded 20 goal contributions in 33 appearances for Sporting's under-23s last season and now has 10 goals involvements in 44 games this campaign.\nWhile he was deployed on the wing to help both attack and defence under now Manchester United boss Amorim, he has moved into a more offensive role in a front three under Sporting's new head coach Rui Borges.\n\"He is a very complete player, a very put together player,\" Fernandes added. \"He has the mentality that he always has to go back and help the team to defend. He doesn't stay up front.\n\"I think the right word to describe Quenda is he is a very brave player.\n\"His main strength is one on one challenges. He is really strong on the duels with the ball at his feet. It is very rare for a defender here in Portugal to stop Quenda in a duel or one on one challenge.\"\nFernandes also told BBC Sport that Quendas had a 100m euro (\u00a384m) release clause, but that Sporting would sell for about half that price with the right negotiations.\n\"With Sporting having almost another season-and-a-half with the player, this did the trick for Chelsea to seize the opportunity,\" Fernandes said.\n\"He is going to a team that explores youth and young players and I think that is what Chelsea saw.\n\"To seize the opportunity to sign a player who in two seasons time would be double the price and would be much harder to sign.\"\nHe is impressing with his pace, strength and technical ability already, but would he be ready to step up to the Premier League level?\n\"He is a generational talent,\" Ferandes believes.\n\"The mentality is there, psychologically he is there and I think he is ready to play for Chelsea and to play in the Premier League.\n\"He will need to adapt to playing in a bigger league, a bigger club, with bigger challenges and bigger opponents.\"\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "German lawmakers have voted to allow a huge increase in defence and infrastructure spending - a seismic shift for the country that could reshape European defence.\nA two-thirds majority of Bundestag parliamentarians, required for the change, approved the vote on Tuesday.\nThe law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules, and create a \u20ac500bn ($547bn; \u00a3420bn) infrastructure fund.\nThis vote is a historic move for traditionally debt-shy Germany, and could be hugely significant for Europe, as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds on, and after US President Donald Trump signalled an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.\nHowever, state government representatives in the upper house, the Bundesrat, still need to approve the moves - also by a two-thirds majority - before they officially become law. That vote is set for Friday.\nFriedrich Merz, the man behind these plans and who is expected to soon be confirmed as Germany's new chancellor, told the lower house during Tuesday's debate that the country had \"felt a false sense of security\" for the past decade.\n\"The decision we are taking today... can be nothing less than the first major step towards a new European defence community,\" he said, adding that it includes countries that are \"not members of the European Union\".\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the vote \"excellent news\".\nSpeaking at a press conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, she said the vote \"sends a very clear message to Europe that Germany is determined to invest massively in defence\".\nFrederiksen meanwhile called it \"fantastic news for all Europeans\".\nGermany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.\nBut despite fears the vote would be tight, lawmakers in the end voted in favour of the changes by 513 to 207 - comfortably over the two-thirds majority required.\nOne leading German newspaper described this vote as \"A day of destiny for our nation\".\nUnder the measure, any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing.

        "summary": "Germany votes for historic boost to defence spending20 hours agoShareSaveFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentReporting fromBerlinToby LuckhurstBBC NewsReporting fromLondonShareSaveGetty ImagesGermany has voted to exempt spending on defence from its strict federal debt rulesGerman lawmakers have voted to allow a huge increase in defence and infrastructure spending - a seismic shift for the country that could reshape European defence.A two-thirds majority of Bundestag parliamentarians, required for the change, approved the vote on Tuesday.The law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules, and create a \u20ac500bn ($547bn; \u00a3420bn) infrastructure fund.This vote is a historic move for traditionally debt-shy Germany, and could be hugely significant for Europe, as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds on, and after US President Donald Trump signalled an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.Getty ImagesThis is a big political win for Friedrich Merz (centre), expected to be Germany's next chancellorHowever, state government representatives in the upper house, the Bundesrat, still need to approve the moves - also by a two-thirds majority - before they officially become law. \"The decision we are taking today... can be nothing less than the first major step towards a new European defence community,\" he said, adding that it includes countries that are \"not members of the European Union\".EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the vote \"excellent news\".Speaking at a press conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, she said the vote \"sends a very clear message to Europe that Germany is determined to invest massively in defence\".Frederiksen meanwhile called it \"fantastic news for all Europeans\".Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.But despite fears the vote would be tight, lawmakers in the end voted in favour of the changes by 513 to 207 - comfortably over the two-thirds majority required.One leading German newspaper described this vote as \"A day of destiny for our nation\".Under the measure, any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. The defence plans approved today by the Bundestag also allow spending on aid for states \"attacked in violation of international law\" to be exempt from the debt brake.That will enable outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz to release \u20ac3bn in aid to Ukraine as early as next week.Merz chose to push the changes through the old parliament, knowing the vote arithmetic was more favourable now than it would be after 25 March, when the new parliament session begins.The far-right AFD and far-left Linke, which both performed well in February's election, oppose Merz's plans.Merz has still not agreed a coalition deal to govern Germany after his election win, and has announced ambitious plans to have a government in place by Easter.Coalition negotiations in Germany, however, can drag on for months at a time.War in UkraineGermanyDonald TrumpFriedrich MerzGerman federal elections 2025 Until now, this debt brake has been fixed at 0.35% of GDP.The change could transform the country's partially neglected armed forces in an era of great uncertainty for Europe.And this vote was not just about defence.

        "article_text": "Unalaska Island in the remote Aleutian archipelago was part of an epic, but now mostly forgotten, military campaign during World War Two.\nSituated where the northern Pacific Ocean meets the Bering Sea, the remote US island of\u00a0Unalaska\u00a0straddles the liminal zone where North America transitions into Siberia. The island lies further west than Hawaii; its position on the cusp of East Asia makes it one of Alaska's more remote and idiosyncratic communities.\nPart of the Aleutian Islands, a 1,100-mile volcanic archipelago that curves in a westward arc to within 600 miles of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, Unalaska features one of the harshest environments on the planet outside the polar regions. The windswept coastlines are rugged, often precipitous and almost entirely devoid of trees.\nBecause of the Aleutians' location in the Pacific Ring of Fire \u2013 one of the world's most seismically active areas \u2013 earthquakes are ubiquitous, and half of the island chain's 70 volcanoes, including Unalaska's active\u00a0Makushin\u00a0volcano, have erupted in the last 250 years. \"Cradle of Storms\" and \"Birthplace of Winds\" are two well-deserved nicknames among locals for the Aleutians. Conflicting weather systems generated in neighbouring seas result in cyclonic storms, hurricane-force winds, heavy rain and dense fog that have a considerable impact upon weather across much of Canada and the continental US.\nToday roughly 4,200 people call Unalaska home, including fishermen and the Indigenous Unangax\u0302 people (pronounced Oo-Nung-akhh). Also referred to as the Aleuts, the Unangax\u0302 have lived in the archipelago and parts of the Alaska Peninsula for at least 9,000 years, creating a subsistence lifestyle that drew upon every resource that the land and sea offered. But over the past several centuries, the Unangax\u0302 population has plummeted due to disease and the gradual attrition of their culture that came on the heels of colonialism. Today there are\u00a0around 2,000 Unangax\u0302\u00a0in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, this wind-battered island has historically been home to another very different group of peoples who also migrated across what is now the Bering Strait: Russians.\u00a0\nAfter Danish explorer Vitus Bering and his Russian colleague Alexei Chirikov became the first-known Europeans to visit the Aleutian Islands in 1741, waves of Russian fur traders flocked to the archipelago to hunt sea otters and fur seals. After establishing a Russian settlement on Unalaska in 1759, the islands officially became a colony of the Russian Empire in the late 1700s. Today many inhabitants still have Russian surnames. The Russian Orthodox Church followed the fur hunters, building small houses of worship across the islands and converting many Unangax\u0302 to their faith.\nAlthough the US gained control of the Aleutian Islands when it purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the Russian Orthodox legacy has survived. Unalaska's\u00a0Church of the Holy Ascension\u00a0is one of a few Russian Orthodox houses of worship that remain. Rebuilt atop its original 1824 location in 1896, it is the oldest cruciform-style Russian Orthodox cathedral in North America, and contains one of Alaska's greatest collection of Russian artefacts, religious icons and artworks \u2013 including some that were donated directly from\u00a0Catherine the Great.\nBefore the arrival of the current Russian Orthodox priest, reverend Evon Bereskin was Unalaska's sole Christian Orthodox priest and the keeper of the Church of the Holy Ascension from 2013 to 2023. A member of the Unangax\u0302 community, he oversaw all the parishes in the Aleutian islands.\n\"I am constantly in awe of the fact that I [was] the custodian of this incredible relic building,\" he told me. \"It [was] an unbelievable honour and responsibility.\"\nAs head of the church, Reverend Bereskin raised funds to restore the church and its icons, which had suffered at the hands of time and the elements. He also changed the liturgy of his services to English (from the Unangax\u0302 language and old Slavonic) to make services more accessible to worshippers.\nPrior to World War Two, the US had a modest commercial and military presence on the Aleutian Islands, which, lying relatively close to East Asia, were vulnerable to attack after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. On 3-4 June 1942, planes from two Japanese aircraft carriers attacked Dutch Harbor in the town of Unalaska on the island's northern coast, killing 50 people. Several days later Japanese forces invaded Kiska and Attu islands, the westernmost islands in the Aleutians (670 and 850 miles from Unalaska, respectively), in an attempt to inflict a psychological blow and divert US forces from the Central Pacific theatre, where the Battle of Midway Island was about to take place. It was the first invasion of US soil since the British incursions in 1812. The SS Northwestern, a passenger and freight steamship used by the US Navy in the war, was destroyed in the Japanese attack on Dutch Harbor. Its rusted hull still rises above the water's surface, a ghostly reminder of a bloody battle.\nWithin months of the Dutch Harbor attack, 145,000 US and Canadian soldiers were deployed to defend and retake the occupied Aleutians. They secured the islands with fortresses, artillery and bunkers, such one on\u00a0Bunker Hill\u00a0above Dutch Harbor, which is now the setting of a\u00a0hike\u00a0with stunning 360-degree views. A larger base overlooking Unalaska Bay and the Bering Sea a few miles away on nearby Mount Ballyhoo, known as\u00a0Fort Schwatka, once featured 100 buildings and was built to withstand earthquakes and hurricane-force winds. Epic, harrowing battles were fought on bleak and difficult terrain. Thousands died on both sides of the conflict \u2013 many from exposure to the islands' harsh weather. By August 1943, the Japanese were expelled from the Aleutians, and over time, the battles that took place here have been largely forgotten.\nAfter the Japanese attacks, the US military ordered the mandatory evacuation of the Unangax\u0302 from the Aleutians for their safety and to prepare the island for arriving military forces. Residents were given less than a day's notice, allowed one suitcase each and weren't told where they were going or when they would return. In all, 881 Unangax\u0302 were expelled from nine villages across the archipelago and were interned at abandoned canneries in the temperate rainforests of south-eastern Alaska for three years. Many had never left their homeland before, let alone seen trees.\nAround 10% of the camps' population perished due to poor housing and sanitation conditions and limited access to health care. Those who returned to Unalaska in 1945 found their villages either looted or burned down. In the 1980s, the Unangax\u0302 sued for ill-treatment and deprivation of their rights in conjunction with\u00a0Japanese Americans who were also interned\u00a0during the war. In 1988, a restitution law was passed granting financial compensation and an apology to the Unangax\u0302 from both Congress and the President. Today, an etched stone slab Unalaska serves as is a memorial to that dark period.\nAfter World War Two, Unalaska became a hub of the US' commercial fishing industry, which still dominates the island today. Dutch Harbor is the\u00a0US' top commercial fishing port by volume\u00a0and the main delivery port featured on Discovery Channel's hit reality show,\u00a0Deadliest Catch. Four hundred vessels from 14 countries make port here each year, catching several hundred million pounds of fish \u2013 around 10% of the entire US fishing industry. Halibut, salmon, herring and several varieties of crab are among the species caught in nearby waters.\nAlaskan pollock comprises 80% of all seafood processed on the island and is used to produce fish oil, fish fillets (for frozen fish sticks and McDonald\u2019s Filet-o-Fish sandwiches) and surimi (imitation crab meat) among other products. UniSea, the largest seafood processing plant on the island, has some of the highest environmental standards of any fishery in Alaska, including traceable seafood and lowest by-catch.\n\"We use every part of the pollock fish here and nothing goes to waste,\" said Tom Enlow, president and CEO of UniSea and a resident of Unalaska. \"Fish oil gives us a renewable hydrocarbon to help power and heat our plant and worker accommodations, thereby offsetting the burning of diesel.\"\u00a0\nIn addition to an abundance of fish, Unalaska's nutrient-rich waters play host to a\u00a0rich variety of marine mammals, including orcas, Dall porpoises, sea otters, harbour seals and whales (humpback, pilot and fin). Steller's sea lions gather on isolated rocks known as rookeries to mate and give birth between May and July. The Aleutian coastlines are also home to a nesting seabird population that is larger than that of the rest of the US combined. Bird enthusiasts travel from all over the world to see the varied waterfowl, especially the ultra-rare whiskered auklet.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0hiking Unalaska's trails\u00a0exposes the remote corners of the island. Traversing its rolling alpine meadows and dramatic mountains is to experience the palpable soul of the Aleutians. These poetic, lyrical landscapes soften the harsh and sometimes unforgiving attributes of a place deeply beholden to the elements.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "It all started with one question.\nA query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.\nAnd no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.\nInstead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.\nWhen Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.\nThe chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too. \nLater, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.\nAnd just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".  \nEven law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket. \nAt first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".\nBefore its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.\n\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.\nBut then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nA tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\". \nWhen an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.\nMr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.\n\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.\n\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.\nNikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".\n\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.\n\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.\n\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.\nWhen the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"\nJoyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.\n\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.\nIndia's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports. \nWhile some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.\nWith additional reporting by Nikita Yadav in Delhi \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Eddie Jordan played the drums in a band called Eddie & The Robbers, and would often be on stage at Silverstone during the British Grand Prix weekend\nEddie Jordan, who has died aged 76, was one of the most flamboyant Formula 1 team bosses in the sport's history.\nRising to wealth and notoriety at a time when motorsport was a kind of Wild West featuring many chancers and deal-makers, Jordan's outspoken, over-the-top personality stood out.\nHe was a rogue who was sometimes loveable, sometimes dodgy, and occasionally both at the same time.\nJordan's arrival in a location would commonly be marked by hearing a Dublin accent yelling across a crowd at someone, launching an expletive-laden rant full of insults, backed by a smile. The worse it sounded, the more it was an indication of his respect for the recipient.\nIn his early days, he sold salmon out of the back of a van in the Irish capital. The fast, witty sales talk he mastered there stood him in good stead throughout a motor racing career that had its share of success but was all too often a struggle to survive.\nMany are the people whom Jordan betrayed along the way. But somehow his character flaws were largely indulged, and he was generally regarded with affection.\nEven when behaving badly, he had a warmth and humour that made it hard not to like him.\nI knew him for more than 30 years, and was often on the receiving end of one of those sweary rants.\nIn between the banter, Jordan was kind and supportive, and working with him, whether as journalist and team owner or broadcasting colleagues, was always a pleasure.\nI last saw him in September, at the announcement that Adrian Newey had signed for Aston Martin. The fact that Jordan brokered that deal while suffering from cancer speaks volumes, as does the quiet, humble, determined way he shared his diagnosis.\nChequered Flag podcast: Eddie Jordan Tribute\nEddie Jordan - pictures in the life of a Formula 1 icon\nThis video can not be played\nEddie Jordan: Former Formula 1 team boss dies aged 76\nThere was also a rock'n'roll aspect to his character. He played the drums in a band and had many associates in the music industry including John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd, and Boyzone's Shane Lynch.\nHe founded a Formula 1 team out of nothing, built it to win races, and even in one heady year challenged for the championship. But he could not survive for long in the rarefied air at the summit of the sport, and the team sank even quicker than it rose.\nOf course, when it was on its last legs and he sold it on, he made himself a fortune. He was always a canny businessman with an eye for a deal.\nPerhaps that is what attracted the eye of Bernie Ecclestone, F1's commercial boss throughout Jordan's career. Ecclestone, a former second-hand car dealer, recognised a kindred spirit and was a kind of guardian angel at times as Jordan navigated the choppy waters of being a privateer team owner.\nJordan first encountered motor racing on Guernsey, where he spent the summer of 1970 when a banking strike in Dublin meant he could not work in his job as a clerk. On his return to Ireland, he bought a kart, and won the Irish championship at his first attempt in 1971.\nHe moved up into motor racing in 1974, first into Formula Ford and then Formula 3, only to suffer a nasty accident at Mallory Park in 1976 and badly break a leg.\nIn hospital, his hair fell out. On seeing this, his mother Eileen - by all accounts, a formidable woman - procured him a wig, and demanded he wear it.\nHe never appeared without one again. Although there was the odd time in the early days when future grand prix driver Gerhard Berger, a renowned practical joker, would sneak up behind Jordan with a high-pressure air line, and blow the hairpiece off his head.\nJordan resumed his career, but by 1979 he was struggling to find money to pursue it, and he turned to team ownership.\nJordan gave Michael Schumacher his Formula 1 debut at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix\nEddie Jordan Racing achieved considerable success in F3 and F3000 through the 1980s. And he helped launch the career of many top-level drivers including Eddie Irvine, Johnny Herbert, Jean Alesi, Martin Brundle and Damon Hill.\nBy the end of the decade, he had his sights on F1. He hired engineer Gary Anderson to create the car, and he and his small team produced the Jordan 191, an elegant design now regarded as one of the most beautiful grand prix cars in history.\nDespite having two journeyman drivers in Italian veteran Andrea de Cesaris and Belgian novice Bertrand Gachot, the team immediately punched above their weight with a series of eye-catching performances. But the defining moment of the year came at the Belgian Grand Prix.\nJordan needed a replacement for Gachot, who had been sent to jail in the UK for using CS gas in an altercation with a London taxi driver. Mercedes offered him \u00a3150,000 to field their protege Michael Schumacher. The German was an immediate sensation.\nSpa-Francorchamps is regarded as one of the world's most demanding circuits, and Schumacher had never driven around it before. Yet he qualified the car seventh - four places and more than 0.7 seconds ahead of De Cesaris.\nA clutch failure on the first lap caused Schumacher's retirement, but Jordan left Spa optimistic about what could be for his team with this brilliant young driver in the cockpit.\nMichael Schumacher drives the Jordan in practice for the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix\nThe problem was, Jordan had not tied down Schumacher properly, and the rival Benetton team swooped, with a little help from Ecclestone - who knew about Jordan's financial difficulties as they navigated their first season, and wanted this obvious new star in a more successful, stable and secure environment.\nBy the next race, the Italian Grand Prix, Schumacher was a Benetton driver. McLaren boss Ron Dennis sympathised, after a fashion, with Jordan, saying to him: \"Welcome to the Piranha Club.\" The phrase has entered the lexicon, so perfect is it in summing up the ruthlessness of the F1 business environment.\nIn desperate need of a cash injection, Jordan switched from his off-the-shelf Cosworth engine to a factory deal with Yamaha for its V12 for 1992.\nBut the engine was heavy, thirsty and unreliable, and a difficult season followed before Jordan ditched the Yamaha for a privateer Hart engine.\nRubens Barrichello became a fixture in the cockpit, as the Brazilian brought a handy budget along with his obvious talent. For 1994, he was joined by Northern Ireland's Irvine, who had made a headline-grabbing debut in Japan at the end of 1993.\nIrvine's outspoken, insouciant character fitted well with the team. In Suzuka, he had un-lapped himself on race leader Ayrton Senna's McLaren while the pair battled  HIll's Williams in the wet.\nAnd Irvine's lippy dismissiveness when confronted by Senna complaining about the incident after the race led the three-time champion to punch him.\nJordan, a keen musician himself, loved the company of rock stars so relished the chance to speak to Sir Paul McCartney at the 2011 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nJordan earned himself a tidy packet by selling Irvine to Ferrari to join Schumacher at the end of 1995, and soon a series of dominoes started to fall that made Jordan major contenders for a while.\nJordan had taken works Peugeot engines for 1995 when they were cast off by McLaren after just one season. That helped them attract a major title sponsorship from tobacco company Benson & Hedges. Funding changed from being desperately sought to something that could be used for investment.\nFor 1997, Jordan wanted Hill, after he was dumped by Williams despite winning the world title at the end of 1996. Hill demurred, and made the error of joining Arrows instead.\nBut he did sign for 1998, replacing Giancarlo Fisichella as the team-mate of Ralf Schumacher, younger brother of Michael, with whom Hill had fought tense title battles in 1994 and 1995.\nAlong with Hill, Jordan had also secured a supply of Mugen Honda engines, more powerful and reliable than the Peugeots, and the services of highly regarded designer Mike Gascoyne.\nAfter a disappointing start, Anderson left mid-season, and the team began to gain in competitiveness.\nJordan's first F1 win came through a one-two at the 1998 Belgian Prix. Race winner Damon Hill is in the background while Ralf Schumacher appears unhappy after Jordan imposed team orders for his drivers not to battle after they took first and second positions in the race\nAt a wet Belgian Grand Prix, after Michael Schumacher crashed out in his Ferrari after colliding with David Coulthard's McLaren, the Jordan drivers found themselves running one-two, Hill in the lead. Jordan avoided a potential on-track drama by telling them to hold position, but created an off-track one.\nThe decision led to a visit from an unhappy Michael Schumacher to tell Jordan he had been unfair not to let his brother race for the win - ironic, considering the German's status as Ferrari's number one.\nFor 1999, Ralf Schumacher was tempted away by Williams, and their driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen went the other way. It became Jordan's most successful season.\nAs Hill faded into uncompetitiveness, Frentzen won two races and emerged as an unlikely title contender, but a bizarre retirement when leading the European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring ended their hopes.\nThe team had found a clever - and dubious - way to use anti-stall as launch control. But Frentzen forgot to turn off the system as he left the pits from his stop for fuel and tyres, and that triggered a safety system that cut the engine. Jordan were never to be so competitive again.\nJordan's most successful F1 season was in 1999, when Heinz-Harald Frentzen won two races and finished third in the drivers' championship\nOver the succeeding years, Anderson rejoined, drivers came and went, there were fights over engine supply, and the money began to dry up. But there was one more win - for Fisichella in the chaotically wet Brazilian Grand Prix of 2003.\nMcLaren's Kimi Raikkonen was declared the winner after a massive crash brought the race to a halt, but the officials had missed that Fischella had actually been leading at the crucial point - and the trophy was handed over at a ceremony at the following race in Imola.\nFinancial troubles worsened in 2004 and late in the year Ecclestone introduced Jordan to the Canadian businessman Alex Shnaider. Six weeks later, in January 2005, the team was sold for $60m.\nThe deal made Jordan secure for life, but on the day he signed it he was in tears in the office of commercial director Ian Phillips, who had been with the team from the start.\nFour years later, Jordan was back on the scene as an outspoken television pundit for BBC Sport, after the corporation won back the rights to F1, and he developed a reputation for being involved in breaking big stories.\nThese included Michael Schumacher's return to F1 with Mercedes in 2010, and that Lewis Hamilton was bound for the same team for 2013. \nIn truth, the Hamilton story was more collaborative than was admitted, to protect sources, and Jordan's involvement was not as singular as was presented at the time.\nJordan, pictured with presenter Suzi Perry and fellow pundit David Coulthard, worked on the BBC's F1 TV coverage from 2009 to 2015\nHe stayed on board as coverage switched to Channel 4 from 2016, albeit appearing with decreasing regularity. But, deal-maker as ever, Jordan was always working behind the scenes, and in 2024 he pulled his last master deal.\nNow acting as the manager of his friend Newey, Jordan negotiated an exit from Red Bull for F1's greatest ever designer, and a five-year deal with Aston Martin for a salary that could reach \u00a330m with add-ons and bonuses.\nThe irony was unmissable - Aston Martin is the latest iteration of the team Jordan had founded. It had passed through various name changes and owners to end up with the Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, who has built a new factory on the site Jordan had used since 1991.\nNot long after the Newey deal was sealed, Jordan revealed in December 2024 that he was being treated for aggressive prostate cancer, though that did not stop him heading a consortium which bought London Irish rugby club in early 2025.\nHe is survived by his wife Marie, and their four children, Zoe, Miki, Zak and Kyle.\nIn recent years, Jordan was the manager for former Red Bull chief technical officer Adrian Newey\nInterviewing Lewis Hamilton on the podium following the 2014 Spanish Grand Prix",

        "article_text": "Residents will be protected from landslips, with more than \u00a334m being invested to improve safety at coal tip sites across Wales. \nThere have been a number of incidents, such as in November 2024 during Storm Bert, when homes in Cwmtillery, Blaenau Gwent, were damaged and people evacuated. \nResidents in the village said they felt like they had been forgotten, with one saying the money had come too late following a harrowing six months for people in the area. \nThe funding will see safety work take place at 130 sites in 10 local authority areas - with \u00a311.5m focused on Rhondda Cynon Taf, which has the most coal tips classified as posing the highest risk. \n\"It's all too late. It should have been done a long time ago,\" said Cwmtillery resident Russell Martin. \n\"Three years or more, four it's been around. We knew it could have happened. Not only that, it's deterioration of properties now.\"\nHe described sand bags being a feature of life now and concerns when there's bad weather, adding: \"If we were not of this age we wouldn't stay here.\n\"We are not moving now at 72 and 71 years of age.\"\n\"We haven't got a council house and can't just say 'you move me, I don't want to live here, I want to move from here',\" said another resident, Diane Morgan.\n\"We've put a lot of money into this [house], we still are, we've worked really hard. It's upsetting. Why should we live under this threat?\"\nShe gave a cautious welcome to the funding news, describing the \"pure carnage\" of \"two trees, massive boulders, slurry down the hill\", during Storm Bert. \nBut she also said she had sent photos to the authorities in the past following storms when rivers of water had been running down the street, saying: \"It's like we don't exist.\"\nWith more storms than ever happening, she called on the authorities to \"get your priorities right\". \nDeputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies described the Welsh government funding as \"unprecedented\", with it sitting alongside \u00a325m pledged by the UK government last October.\nWith coal tips dotted around the south Wales valleys - a legacy of the area's mining past - fears have existed for some time about the potential risks they pose.\nThese concerns were heightened in 2020, after a landslip in Tylorstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf. \nSome 60,000 tonnes of spoil material slid down the side of an old coal tip, entering a river.\nThis led to the launch of a Coal Tip Safety Taskforce between the Welsh and UK governments.\nA total of 2,573 disused coal tips were identified, with 360 classed as having \"the potential to impact public safety\" and requiring regular inspection.\nA review, commissioned by the Welsh government, found existing laws on tip safety - introduced in the wake of the Aberfan disaster in 1966 - no longer provided \"an effective management framework\", as they were designed for a time when there was an active coal industry.\nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest number of the most risky category D tips in Wales. \nThe local authority area will receive \u00a311.49m, with Neath Port Talbot getting \u00a36.34m, Merthyr Tydfil \u00a34.2m, Caerphilly \u00a32.78m, Blaenau Gwent \u00a31.997m, Torfaen \u00a31.98m and Bridgend \u00a31.8m, in the major awards. \nWork will be carried out by local authorities, and Natural Resources Wales (NRW).\n\"These tips are a visible symbol of how coal mining shaped the valleys but many years later, the tips are still causing issues around safety and pollution which have to be addressed urgently,\" said Neath Port Talbot council leader Steve Hunt.\nNRW will get \u00a32.298m, while Wrexham will get \u00a3823,000, Cardiff \u00a3110,000 and Monmouthshire \u00a316,000. \nMr Irranca-Davies, who also has responsibility for climate change, said he hoped a Disused Mine and Quarry Tips (Wales) Bill introduced in the Senedd last December, would provide further reassurances. \n\"If passed, this ground-breaking legislation will establish a dedicated public body to safeguard against threats from tip instability,\" he said. \n\"The new authority would take full responsibility for assessment, registration, monitoring and management of these sites across Wales, helping to provide peace of mind to nearby communities.\"",

        "article_text": "Oscar (left) joined Shanghai Port from Chelsea for a reported \u00a360m in January 2017\nWhen China's president, Xi Jinping, visited Manchester in October 2015, there followed a bizarre photo opportunity and a bold statement.\nThe former was an image of two global leaders - Xi and then UK Prime Minister David Cameron - posing alongside Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero. The unlikely selfie went viral on social media.\nThe latter laid out a target that seemed much more likely for a nation of 1.4 billion people - and the football world took notice.\nIn a written interview with the news agency Reuters, President Xi said he wanted China's national team to become \"one of the best in the world\".\nSix months after Xi's visit to the UK, the Chinese government launched a strategy that aimed to make the country a \"world football superpower\" by 2050.\nIn the long term, the president wanted China to host and be competitive at the men's World Cup. By 2030, he wanted China to be one of the best teams in Asia.\nWhen the strategy was announced, China were 81st in the Fifa world rankings. Today, they sit 90th - wedged between New Zealand and the Caribbean island of Curacao.\nChina's only appearance at a men's World Cup remains at the 2002 tournament in Japan and South Korea, where they were eliminated in the group stage.\nShould they lose to Saudi Arabia and Australia in this month's international break, it would almost certainly end their hopes of reaching the next edition in 2026.\nDespite that, some of Xi's aims are already taking shape - his strategy having been set out over three stages, spanning 34 years.\nOne of them was to get tens of millions of young people playing the sport regularly. China's community football projects have indeed been hugely upscaled, with pitches now accessible all over the country.\n\"This absolutely kicked into high gear from 2016 - football pitches were springing up everywhere,\" says Dr Mike Gow - an expert in contemporary China at Edge Hill University.\n\"You're never more than about 10 minutes' walk from either a half-size or full-size all-weather pitch. The scale of it is quite impressive.\"\nXi Jinping posed for a selfie with Sergio Aguero and David Cameron when he visited the UK in 2015\nBut while access has improved, adopting a football culture similar to Europe and the UK is proving more challenging.\nIn 2018, David Sproer was working as a coach in Cologne when he was presented with an opportunity to work for the Shanghai Football Association as a youth coach in the women's game.\n\"It felt like a gold rush,\" he says. \"It felt like things were really taking off, and that Chinese football could make huge steps towards a brighter future.\"\nSproer left the country, along with many other European coaches, during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHe says he has no regrets about his time in China, but believes parts of his experience shone a light on why the country is so dominant in Olympic sports such as gymnastics, diving and table tennis but has struggled in football, where cohesion and communication play a more important role.\n\"Chinese kids are educated and socialised a little differently from European kids,\" he says. \"They grow up with an understanding that there is always a right and a wrong answer.\n\"You have to be a little bit more versatile in football than, say, diving. It's not about perfection, it's also about creativity.\"\nThe growth of the game among young people has also suffered as a result of the perception of football in the country.\nIn December 2024, former Everton midfielder Li Tie was sentenced to 20 years in prison for fixing matches and accepting bribes. He had been China's men's national team coach from January 2020 to December 2021.\nThe saga was the latest in a string of corruption cases that have blighted Chinese football over many years. According to Sproer, they have had an impact on the number of parents willing to volunteer to help in organising youth teams.\n\"Kids are under enormous academic pressure. The parents are under pressure in their jobs,\" he says.\n\"So there isn't much time to volunteer, and there is also not this culture of volunteering, because football in China in the professional leagues doesn't have the greatest image.\"\nHulk spent five season in the Chinese Super League, scoring 51 goals in 100 games\nThree months before Li Tie's sentencing, Chinese football had suffered a blow, with a 7-0 defeat by bitter rivals Japan in World Cup qualifying.\n\"This is like England getting hammered by Germany,\" says Dr Gow.\n\"Fans were angry, but they were more exasperated. Exasperated at the state of the game, and exasperated at the level of corruption in the game.\"\nWhen Xi set out his football plan in 2016, it led to a wave of investment from Chinese private investors in British and European clubs.\nThe Chinese Super League (CSL) had its own resurgence, with wealthy owners pumping money into clubs to finance moves for players such as Oscar, from Chelsea, and Hulk from Zenit St Petersburg.\nNow, only two Chinese investors have overall control of professional clubs in England - the Fosun International Group at Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Dai Yongge, whose tenure at Reading has been beset by financial crises and successive points deductions.\nAnd clubs in the CSL are counting the cost of their transfer spending, with Guangzhou Evergrande, who won eight domestic titles and two Asian Champions Leagues between 2011 and 2019, forced into liquidation in January as a result of unpaid debts.\n\"A lot of entrepreneurs used the China football strategy as a pretext to move money out of China,\" Dr Gow says.\n\"It's very difficult to get your money out of China, so they seized on this opportunity that there was a national policy.\n\"Fairly quickly, within a two- or three-year period, the authorities came along and said 'no, this is not what we want you to be doing,' so they kind of closed the door on that outward investment.\"\nWith the presence of Chinese investors dwindling at European clubs, and with the men's national team still struggling to make inroads on the pitch, it is tempting to write off Xi's ambitions already.\nBut those who've spent time in the country still feel the targets can be met by 2050, with China's results in younger age groups signalling some progress.\n\"Never underestimate them,\" says Dr Gow.\n\"When you have the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China, and they come out with a plan like this, they tend to deliver the objectives.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

The paper's website adds: \"As things stand Russia has scored a diplomatic victory here.\"\nWhy are some in Russia claiming \"victory\" after this two-hour phone call?\nProbably because, by the end of it, Vladimir Putin hadn't been pressured into making any major concessions to Ukraine or to the United States.

She was last seen at a hotel around 04:00 local time on 6 March. \nThe Dominican Republic's police confirmed to the BBC that they had received the request from Ms Konanki's family, but did not provide additional details. \nPolice have been searching for her for the past two weeks. Investigators are considering whether she may have drowned, but have not ruled out foul play.  \nMs Konanki is a 20-year-old college student attending the University of Pittsburgh, where she studies biology and chemistry.  \nThe college junior travelled with a group of five female friends to a resort in Punta Cana on a spring break trip, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office. \nShe is a citizen of India and a permanent resident of the United States. She lives with her family in Chantilly, Virginia, located in Loudoun County. \nMs Konanki was last seen early in the morning of 6 March. \nSurveillance video shows her and a group of friends walking toward the beach. \nShe was with five women and two American men in the video. \nMs Konanki stayed on the beach with one of the men as the others returned to the hotel, Dominican police told the BBC's news partner CBS.\nDominican President Luis Abinader said earlier this week during a news conference that the last person who had contact with Ms Konanki reported a wave hit them while they were on the beach. \nThe parents of the man - Joshua Riibe - last seen with Ms Konanki released a statement to CBS News saying they hope Ms Konanki is \"found as soon as possible\". \nRiibe is a senior at St Cloud State University in Minnesota. \n\"We recognise that this is a complex and painful situation for all parties involved, and we trust that the investigation will be conducted with transparency and justice. Our only interest is that due process be respected and that actions be taken with the fairness that the situation requires,\" the statement reads. \nThe Dominican Republic's national police told the BBC that they had received a request from Ms Konanki's family to declare her dead. \nOfficials have said that they have spent dozens of hours looking for the missing student. \nPolice are dividing search areas and assigning drones to certain sectors. \nPilots are monitoring footage that is being uploaded to a command centre where AI is looking to identify objects in the ocean. \nSearch crews are looking in water and on land. \nAuthorities say it's not clear whether foul play was involved in Ms Konanki's disappearance. \nThere was no blood or signs of violence found at the beach. \nThe University of Pittsburgh, where Ms Konanki is a student, said in a statement they are working with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Homeland Security and local authorities in response to her disappearance. \nThe International Criminal Police Organization, known as Interpol, issued a global alert after Ms Konanki went missing. \nThe yellow notice is for missing persons such as victims of kidnappings or \"unexplained disappearances\".

        "article_text": "'Complicated' but 'honest' - Tuchel's path from barman to England boss\nA new era in English football starts on Friday.\nGerman Thomas Tuchel will become the third non-British permanent manager to lead the England side after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.\nUnder Gareth Southgate, the Three Lions reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and lost in the 2021 and 2024 Euros finals.\nFor the 51-year-old Tuchel, who has an 18-month contract, his job brief is clear, but hugely difficult \u2013 to qualify for and then win the 2026 World Cup.\nHe will be looking to make a lightning start as England have two home qualifiers first up \u2013 Albania at Wembley before entertaining Latvia on Monday.\nBut what can they expect from Tuchel, who guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021, and who has also managed Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich?\nBBC Sport has spoken to those who know Tuchel well to find out more.\n'Incredible' Tuchel helped Gibbs-White over England upset\nHas Tuchel's first squad revealed England's short-term strategy?\nPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their say\nThis video can not be played\nFrom bartender to England manager - Rangnick reflects on Tuchel's journey\nTuchel, who stands at 6ft 4in, was a defender during his playing days.\nHe began at second-tier German side Stuttgarter Kickers, before three years at third division team SSV Ulm until a serious knee injury ended his playing career in 1998, when he was 25.\nHis boss at Ulm was Ralf Rangnick, who went on to manage Schalke, RB Leipzig, Manchester United and is now Austria's head coach.\n\"He was always interested in why we were doing certain things,\" said Rangnick. \"After a couple of weeks, you can tell what player could become a coach - he was always asking questions.\"\nIn 2000, a successful coaching career seemed a long way off for Tuchel, who was pulling pints and collecting glasses.\n\"When I became head coach of Stuttgart, I found out he was working in a bar to earn a living, I could hardly believe it,\" added Rangnick.\n\"I called him and said, 'Why don't you come to us and work as a youth team coach?' That's how his coaching career started.\n\"It was clear he shouldn't be working in a bar and would much rather be on a pitch with a team.\"\nThomas Tuchel was managing in the German Bundesliga at the age of 35 with Mainz\nTuchel worked with Stuttgart Under-15s and a few years later would guide their under-19s to their league title.\nHis first managerial role came in 2007 at FC Augsburg II and two years later he was in charge of Bundesliga outfit Mainz, who had Jurgen Klopp among their former bosses.\nRangnick was not surprised Tuchel would manage at the top level and added: \"Thomas is a very bright, intelligent person. He studied sports in Stuttgart. It was obvious he had quite a few assets of what you need as a manager.\"\nTuchel would also learn from, and emulate, those around him.\nIn five years at Mainz, he qualified for Europe twice, guiding them to fifth in 2010-11, their best ever Bundesliga position.\n\"Tuchel is someone who has been influenced by a lot of managers and coaches \u2013 it's clear he has a constant desire to learn, to be open-minded and curious,\" said former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger.\n\"Ralf Rangnick is one of the coaches who has influenced him - what are you doing when you don't have the ball, how do you win it back, then how do you create chances and score goals?\n\"Tuchel took elements of that, but another element is focused on what you do with the ball too.\n\"With that aspect, Tuchel is very close to Pep Guardiola in terms of the way he thinks about football and how to create chances from your own possession.\n\"Pep was more of a coach he looked up to, in the time they spent together in the Bundesliga [when Guardiola was in charge of Bayern Munich] there was a bond, a relationship forged. They are still friends and they talk regularly.\"\nThomas Tuchel was sacked by Borussia Dortmund three days after winning the German Cup\nIn 2015, Tuchel began his next challenge, replacing Liverpool-bound Klopp as boss of Borussia Dortmund.\nDuring Klopp's seven years at Dortmund, he had won the Bundesliga twice and reached the Champions League final, and Tuchel had to win over his new players, with not all of them keen.\n\"I honestly didn't expect much when it was announced he was going to be the new manager. I was even in talks maybe to leave the club,\" recalled former Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan.\n\"I had one phone call with him and he presented himself to me when I was on holiday in the summer break, and it was actually a really good call.\n\"He tried to explain a few things, how he wanted us to play, how he wanted us to train and everything he said he proved during that season.\"\nGundogan joined Manchester City after Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga at the end of that 2015-16 campaign, while Tuchel claimed the first major trophy of his career, beating Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 in the final of the German Cup in May 2017, in what proved to be his last match at the club.\nFormer Germany international Gundogan, though, was completely won over by Tuchel in their sole season together.\n\"I can only say positive things about him from when we were at Dortmund,\" he added. \"He's outstanding tactically and extremely honest and open. Personally, I got along very well with him.\"\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel's man-management skills would be key to success with England and added: \"The players Tuchel has worked with in the past are very positive about him, and the way he communicates his ideas to them.\n\"I don't think the fact he is German will make any difference. Most of the England players work under foreign managers, or have done. He's a top manager so they will be open to his ideas and used to most of them, so it should be a smooth transition.\"\nRangnick added: \"He's somebody who loves to improve people. As a head coach, you need to be analytic and intelligent. He is curious, funny with a good sense of humour. A very specific humour and, if you know the humour, he can be funny.\"\nThomas Tuchel won Uefa Men's Coach of the Year for 2020-21 after guiding Chelsea to the Champions League\nApart from his almost five-year spell at Mainz, all of Tuchel's jobs have followed a similar pattern \u2013 successful, but not in the same role for long.\nAfter Dortmund, he won Ligue 1 twice and took Paris St-Germain to the Champions League final in a two-and-a-half-year spell.\nChelsea came next, getting the job in January 2021 and winning the Champions League just four months later, beating Guardiola and Gundogan's Manchester City side 1-0 in the final.\nHowever, despite also winning the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup, he was sacked in September 2022.\nBefore England, Bayern Munich was his last managerial job in March 2023, and he instantly won the Bundesliga title within a few months, but was gone at the end of the next campaign - a season that ended without any silverware despite the goals of England captain Harry Kane.\nThis video can not be played\n'We have to free ourselves from history' - new England boss Tuchel\n\"Thomas is not an easy person, or easy to deal with, but all good coaches are complicated,\" said Christian Heidel, Mainz's long-time executive and sporting director, in 2021.\n\"Complicated means they are also tough. They make demands of those around them, their players from morning to night and for that reason, they are incredible coaches.\"\nFormer Augsburg youth coach Heiner Schuhmann described Tuchel as \"an outstanding, passionate player on the pitch, who gave his all\", but felt \"he was so exacting and demanding, which didn't go down well with some of the players\".\nHitzlsperger also felt Tuchel could \"rub people up the wrong way\" in his dealings with club officials and would have to try to avoid that happening with the English Football Association.\n\"It's important Tuchel maintains a good relationship with the FA, the people who have brought him in, and he has to handle the media and public,\" said the former Aston Villa and Stuttgart midfielder.\n\"The same thing must not happen that happened in Bayern and Dortmund, where he fell out with his bosses. I am optimistic there won't be too many disagreements, because at his previous clubs it was often about transfers, which as a national team manager is not an issue.\n\"With the media and the fans, it's different. The advantage he has is he has worked in this country before with Chelsea, so knows what English fans are like.\"\nThomas Tuchel's England side have been drawn in World Cup Qualifying Group K, along with Albania, Andorra, Latvia and Serbia\nTuchel started the England job on 1 January and has been regularly spotted at Premier League matches.\nHe has already shown he will do the job his way, handing a surprise recall to 34-year-old Ajax midfielder Jordan Henderson, as well as first international call-ups for 32-year-old Newcastle defender Dan Burn and 18-year-old Arsenal left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly.\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer felt Tuchel would want to get the best out of the team immediately and said: \"We've been down the route so many times of an English manager having this hope, this belief in three or four years' time we might be this.\n\"This manager has been brought in for now, for the next 18 months, to win the World Cup. That's his job. If he doesn't win the World Cup he won't be here.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBrotherhood, Ben White and playing style - Tuchel answers key questions\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel could succeed and his nationality would soon be ignored if England were winning matches.\n\"His experience in club management will help him with England,\" he added. \"He had to deal with some of the biggest names in world football at PSG for example, and was expected to win everything in France and in European competition.\n\"Hopefully the players want to play for their country because they think this is fun, they play good football and enjoy the way they play.\n\"He will get people excited and out of their seats, thinking 'this is great football, this is what we wanted to see'.\"\nThe 2026 World Cup will be held in Canada, the United States and Mexico and Tuchel will be aiming to become only the second manager to guide England to World Cup glory after Sir Alf Ramsey in 1966.\n\"I would never say, 'he is going to win the World Cup', but he has got one of the best squads in the world, along with Spain, France, Argentina, and Brazil,\" said Hitzlsperger.\n\"Tuchel is probably hoping to play Germany at some stage. Can you imagine? Putting one over Germany in a World Cup \u2013 that would be very sweet for him and it probably wouldn't get any bigger.\n\"If he were to put one over them it would be one of the biggest achievements, just after winning the World Cup, and beating Germany on the way would be fantastic for him.\"",

        "article_text": "Teenage killer Nicholas Prosper shot dead three members of his family and was planning to attack his former primary school. What drove his obsession with mass killings and how was he stopped from committing further atrocities?\nProsper, 19, is beginning a life sentence for murdering his mother Juliana Falcon, 48; his brother Kyle, 16, and sister Giselle, 13, at their flat on Luton's Marsh Farm estate.\nAt Luton Crown Court, he was told he must serve at least 49 years in jail.\nHowever, the death toll could have been even higher were it not for the vigilance of the police officers who spotted and arrested Prosper before he could enact plans to murder primary school pupils and staff.\nA senior detective described that as a \"sliding doors moment\", while one of the arresting officers said the knowledge he had prevented further killings was \"very overwhelming\".\nSentencing, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told Prosper: \"You intended to unleash disaster on the community of Luton. Your plans were intelligent, calculating and selfish. Your ambition was notoriety.\"\nShe paid tribute to Prosper's family, saying \"their deaths are almost certain to have saved the lives of many children\", as it was a neighbour who called police after hearing the disturbance.\nWarning: This story contains distressing details\nProsper killed his victims in the early hours of Friday, 13 September last year.\nAn inquest heard each had gunshot wounds to the head. Kyle had more than 100 knife wounds. Giselle had been shot in the face.\nIt was the first phase of an intended assault that had been a year in the planning.\nProsper planned to attack St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Gardenia Avenue, Luton, killing 30 young children and himself.\nThe date was no accident. He had chosen Friday the 13th \"so it had a good name on it\", the court heard, and had also designed a distinctive black and yellow outfit to wear.\n\"He wanted to be the most notorious and infamous person that's ever committed a school shooting,\" said Det Ch Insp Sam Khanna, of Bedfordshire Police.\n\"He knew numbers; he knew facts and figures, and he wanted to be responsible for the most number of casualties ever killed within a school.\"\nIn August 2023, Prosper made a booking at a shooting range, but did not attend.\nHowever, his online history gives an fuller insight into what drove him.\n\"There's a general theme of extreme violence; content which you can't believe is readily available on the internet,\" said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\n\"There's pretty much not a mass shooting event that he hadn't researched in detail.\n\"He had a fascination with the people that perpetrate such offences and had gone to great detail researching them, almost putting together fact-files of them.\"\nOne of those spree shootings was at Sandy Hook, the Connecticut elementary school where 26 people were killed in 2012.\nProsper was determined to murder more.\nThe BBC has previously reported he was banned from a website featuring videos of people's final moments, after making pro-paedophile comments. \nBy April 2024, he became a member of an online gun sales website, and three months later began researching how to fake a firearms certificate.\nHe then turned to researching his former primary school.\nPolice found no evidence he had a bad time there or bore any grudge, rather that his first-hand knowledge \"would make his plan that much easier\", said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\nIn August, Prosper tried and failed in his first attempt to buy a gun.\nHowever, later that month he contacted another seller on a legal gun sales site, paying \u00a3650 plus \u00a330 petrol money to the man for a shotgun and 100 cartridges.\n\"He basically created a legend of himself to make any would-be seller feel comfortable,\" said Det Ch Insp Khanna. \n\"He went to the lengths of talking about working for a charity as a volunteer to gain the confidence of the seller.\"\nHe researched the logos, signatures and even the type of paper licences were printed on to fool the seller, who police found had committed no offence.\n\"It is a fake, but possibly only an expert would know that,\" said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\nPrivate gun sellers need to inform police of any sale, and the person who sold the shotgun to Prosper did this on 12 September.\nBecause this was done out-of-hours on the day before the killings, there was no opportunity for anyone to realise the gun had been sold to someone who was not a legitimate licence-holder, said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\n\"This can't be allowed to happen again... the Bedfordshire deputy chief constable is engaging with national parties to try and look at this and see what learning can come from it,\" he added.\nThe court heard Prosper planned to shoot and rape Giselle, but his mother \"messed it up\" by waking up.\nKyle hid in the kitchen and \"began pleading for his life\" during the attacks.\nMarium Abbas lived in a flat above theirs. In the early hours of 13 September, she awoke to banging and a \"strange voice which I've never heard, never experienced, in my life\".\nShe went outside her door and saw a neighbour. They discussed calling police, but concluded they did not know what they would tell them.\nLater, officers surrounded the building and Ms Abbas learned of the horror that had unfolded beneath her.\nDespite since being reassured by friends, she said she still felt \"guilty\" and struggled to be alone.\n\"I feel like maybe if I knew what was happening; if I went downstairs; maybe he would have shot me but the children would have been saved,\" she said.\nAfter the killings Prosper went on the run. His arrest, soon afterwards, was a \"sliding doors moment\", said Det Ch Insp Khanna, referring to the film in which a moment of chance becomes pivotal.\nTwo officers returning from the scene to the police station spotted a man whose \"whole behaviour was off\".\n\"Nothing was really said in the car,\" recalled one. \"I think we kind of had the same instinct... 'This seems related.'\n\"As we get closer, we start to see what appears to be blood over his face. At that moment, we believe he was our suspect. \n\"We got him into handcuffs. He just kept on saying 'It's not murder, it's not murder.'\"\nOfficers found a shotgun and 33 cartridges in a nearby bush.\nThe officer said when he learned the extent of Prosper's plans, it was \"very overwhelming knowing that it was me and my crewmate that managed to prevent this from happening\".\nProsper made disclosures to a prison nurse four days after the killings, and also produced two written plans in jail.\n\"Very unusually for most of our cases, he has been talking,\" said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\n\"In terms of why we think he's done this, it's purely around notoriety and wanting to be known for a significant horrific offence and event. \n\"Normally we get people in his position that don't talk and wait for the legal process to go through, but that's the opposite we found with the offender.\"\nThere is no evidence to suggest Prosper was seeking to advance a political or ideological cause. \nHe was not charged with terrorism offences, and nor was he known to the government anti-terrorism programme Prevent.\nHis parents were separated, but both of them and his school had concerns about Prosper and he was referred to a GP.\nBut he refused to engage and that went no further. \nNHS Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes Integrated Care Board NHS has declined to comment, while East London NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services in the area, said Prosper was not under its care.\nWhile in prison, a forensic psychiatrist assessed Prosper as having autistic spectrum disorder traits, but he has not been officially diagnosed.\nHowever, it was determined that it was not these traits that drove his actions; rather, his desire to become infamous and a lack of empathy for others.\nProsper also had a number of indecent images of children on his phone, but because of the severity of the other charges he faced, the Crown Prosecution Service decided against a specific charge on these.\nAt Prosper's first court appearance, his father Ray Prosper shouted: \"I still love you, son. It's not your fault, OK?\" and then wept.\nAt the sentencing hearing, a statement he wrote was read out on his behalf. \n\"When I heard the horrendous news that day, part of my soul died too. This is a lose-lose situation for us all and we have lost four family members,\" he wrote.\nDet Ch Insp Khanna said: \"We're used to going and seeing families and loved ones at the most challenging of times and telling them that unfortunately they've lost a member of their family.\n\"For the offender's father, he's lost two of his children. He's lost his ex-wife, who he still had a good relationship with, and this has been perpetrated by his own son.\"\nHe said police were supporting family members, but added: \"I think it would take a long time before anyone can come to terms with what's happened.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

And what about the other nations who aspire to challenge them?\nThe coaches of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland spoke to the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly podcast before the tournament.\nRugby Union Weekly: Women's Six Nations coaches special\nJohn Mitchell's side are on a 20-game winning run and added a second WXV1 title by beating Canada in October.\nLock Zoe Aldcroft will captain the side after head coach Mitchell opted for a change of leadership from Saracens flanker Marlie Packer, who skippered England for nearly two years.\n\"We've got into rugby work in this camp and she [Aldcroft] goes about it in her own way, but her actions are so consistent when it comes to rugby,\" said Mitchell.\n\"If I was a team-mate, I would follow her, definitely.\"\nGiven England's vast and high-quality player pool, Mitchell will want to win his second Six Nations title but could also use the tournament to further widen his options ahead of the World Cup.\nMitchell added: \"Our depth is a strength I'm grateful for. I'm not working with the Six Nations on a separate island, I've got the end [the World Cup] in mind.\"\nWorld player of the year Ellie Kildunne is the one to watch after bagging nine tries and gaining over 300 metres more than any player in last year's tournament.\nThis video can not be played\nIreland score late to snatch win over New Zealand\nIreland backed up their third-place finish in the championship last year with a remarkable win over New Zealand at WXV1 in October.\nSince Scott Bemand's appointment as head coach in 2023, Ireland have gone from a side who missed out on the World Cup in 2022 to being ranked sixth in the world after five wins last year.\n\"It had been 10 years since Ireland's women had beaten the Black Ferns before that,\" said Bemand. \"We need moments, we need things that people can anchor onto.\n\"The confidence of the group is starting to thrive and they've started to get some experiences; they know they can bounce back from a tough half-time team talk or a loss, they've got evidence.\"\nTheir resurgence has coincided with the rise of number eight Aoife Wafer, who scored six tries across nine Tests last year to be named Ireland women's player of the year.\nLeinster's Wafer, who turns 22 three days after the team's opening match of the championship, is one of the most explosive ball-carriers in women's rugby and scored twice in the historic victory over New Zealand.\nHowever, Ireland will be without injured co-captain Sam Monaghan.\nScotland are one place below Ireland in the world rankings and were defeated by Australia in their WXV2 title decider in October.\nBryan Easson has been bold in his squad selection, naming nine uncapped players, with form and \"a wider player base to pick from\", external his reasoning for selection.\n\"The uncapped players are in because of their performances week on week,\" said Easson.\n\"That's where we're changing a little bit - myself, my coaches and management are not picking on legacy any more, it's not picked on what you've done previously, it's on week-to-week performances in PWR and the Celtic Challenge.\"\nEvie Willis returns to the squad following the nasty anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury she suffered in August 2023 and will be looking to add to her three caps after featuring regularly at centre this season for Leicester Tigers.\nBBC Scotland's Andy Burke:\n\"There is a definite sense this is a Scotland team moving forward and their ambitions have risen accordingly.\n\"The big guns of England and France will almost certainly occupy the top two spots, therefore Scotland's goal is to finish third, something they have managed only twice in the history of the Women's Six Nations, most recently in 2005.\n\"Scotland have finished fourth in the past two campaigns. They finished bottom of the table in eight of the 12 Six Nations that came before, so there is clear evidence of the team becoming more competitive.\n\"Wales, Ireland and Italy are all operating at a similar level to Scotland, and given they host all three in Edinburgh this time around, there is an opportunity to enjoy a very positive campaign that can act as a springboard towards the Rugby World Cup.\n\"The experienced heads of captain Rachel Malcolm, Jade Konkel, Chloe Rollie and Lisa Thomson are all still key figures, but whereas in previous teams they would be required to drag some of the lesser lights along with them, the dawn of professionalism in the women's game in Scotland has started to bear fruit, and now the new faces in the squad are arriving better prepared for Test rugby.\n\"Francesca McGhie, 21, has brought pace and finishing power to an exciting back-three that already boasts proven international performers such as Rollie and Rhona Lloyd.\n\"Back-row Alex Stewart was Scotland's breakout star in last year's tournament, the then 19-year-old producing some dominant displays to mark her out as not only a star of the future, but one for here and now.\n\"There looks to be an excellent blend of youth and experience in this Scotland squad, one that could produce a big year if they can generate some precious momentum in this Six Nations.\"\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast\nIoan Cunningham stood down as head coach in November following an underwhelming year of results for Wales.\nAfter finishing the Six Nations with the Wooden Spoon - only managing one narrow win over Italy - Cunningham's side achieved a solitary victory against Japan in their WXV2 campaign.\nSean Lynn, newly recruited from Gloucester-Hartpury, has taken charge.\nLynn said: \"My values as a coach are three words; caring, challenge and passionate. Everything I brought into Gloucester-Hartpury was about togetherness and making sure we were all aligned.\n\"My big value coming from Wales is how passionate and caring the family is and that's what I wanted to bring into this environment - the family and the future family that we've got in this pathway, which is super exciting.\"\nCaptain Hannah Jones, fresh off the back of a third successive PWR title with Lynn, will be a danger in the midfield with her hard running lines.\nWith excitement building around the new era, more than 10,000 tickets have already been sold for England's visit to Principality Stadium on 29 March, breaking the previous record home attendance for the team.\nHowever, a big loss for Wales is the absence of destructive prop Sisilia Tuipulotu, who will miss the tournament with a hamstring injury.\nSix Wales players to watch in Women's Six Nations\nFrance, fourth in the world rankings, are the last team to beat the Red Roses in the competition back in 2018.\nHowever, their losing run against the champions has extended to 13 games and they will need to show big improvements to mount a title challenge this year.\nUnder co-head coaches Gaelle Mignot and David Ortiz, Les Bleues struggled at WXV1, losing heavily to Canada and New Zealand.\nWing Marine Menager is likely to be the team's leading light once again.

I'm just so glad that it has reached somebody and did good.\"\nJoel was also touched by the message.\n\"It's amazing\u2026 TikTok's been an amazing thing,\" he says.\nClare says she has also had to deal with a small number of hurtful comments. \nFollowing a \"really horrible comment\" she posted a video in response.\nShe said: \"To that person and all the other people that didn't get enough love as a child, I'm going to prove on here that people with Down's syndrome can do absolutely anything...\n\"[Joel] certainly wouldn't say a nasty word about anybody, certainly not somebody he doesn't even know so I wish there were less people like you in the world and more people like Joel.\" \nRecalling that post, Clare says she usually chooses to \"ignore the negativity\" but felt she had to speak out that day.\n\"It doesn't bother us,\" she says. \nClaire was 24  and had not long been married when she discovered she was pregnant.\nShe says she had all the usual scans throughout her pregnancy but only discovered Joel had Down's syndrome after he was born.  \n\"I thought there was something off because everyone kept asking if I was okay and put me in a room on my own,\" she recalls. \nWhen a paediatric consultant came to see her she asked him if everything was OK.\n\"He said 'we're 99% sure that your little boy has Down's syndrome',\" she says. \n\"It frightened me to death because I didn't know anything about it at all\u2026 it was a scary, scary time.\"\nClare and Joel's dad barely had time for the news to sink in before Joel became critically ill.\nClare says after being told he had two holes in the heart, bowel disorder Hirschsprung's disease and seeing him in an incubator she gained a new perspective.\n\"I didn't care what he had, I just wanted Joel to be alive and be OK\u2026. so I came to terms with [him having Down's syndrome] relatively quickly,\" she says.\nJoel spent his first five years of his life in and out of hospital.\n\"You're so grateful for every single milestone and I still am,\" says Clare.\nClare and Joel's dad separated when he was a teenager and Joel now lives with Clare and his step-dad and has four step siblings.\nHe spends two nights a week at his dad's house. \n\"You've got a hot tub there haven't you Joel, you like to put the music on,\" says Claire.\n\"We're away with the fairies having a few cans,\" says Joel, prompting Clare to erupt into laughter. \n\"Away with the fairies,\" she laughs.\nWith Joel now a grown man there has inevitably been some talk of him moving out of the family home.\nBut there's a sticking point - some of Joel's friends who are slightly older than him have moved into assisted living but that does not appeal to Joel.\n\"Joel wants to live in the West End with all the actresses so I'm trying to get into Joel's head that's not going to happen,\" laughs Clare.\n\"But no Clare, let me speak,\" interrupts Joel.\n\"I want to be in the West End, on stage.\"\n\"But we're not thinking about moving out yet are we,\" says Clare.\n\"Not yet,\" answers Joel, \"but if I had a girlfriend - Sophie Evans?\".\nJoel is a super fan of Welsh singer and actress Sophie Evans, who played Glinda in the West End production of Wicked.\nThe pair have met many times when Joel and Clare have gone to see her perform and she visited the family in August for Joel's birthday. \n\"She's married,\" laughs Clare.\n\"She has a child and another one on the way.\"\n\"I'm the father,\" says Joel, and the pair peal into laughter.\nThis kind of exchange is typical and precisely what is keeping their followers on TikTok entertained. \n\"We laugh most of the time and then cry from laughing,\" says Joel. \n\"I've got a wonderful mother, she's the best.

        "article_text": "The Bank of England has warned economic and global trade uncertainty has \"intensified\" as it held UK interest rates at 4.5%.\nUS trade tariffs and retaliation to the import taxes from the likes of the EU have created uncertainty for countries, the Bank said.\nIts decision to hold rates was widely expected, but governor Andrew Bailey said the Bank still believed rates were \"on a gradually declining path\".\nEconomists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year, with many suggesting the next could come in May.\nMr Bailey reiterated it was the Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\". Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, currently remains above the Bank's 2% target, at 3%.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.\nThe base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The relatively higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.\nAbout 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so the latest decision will not have any immediate impact on monthly repayments.\nMore than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, so they face higher repayment costs when deals end. \nMortgage rates have been edging down recently. On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.33%, while the average five-year fix was 5.18%.\nLouise Gibson, who lives in a one-bedroom flat in Epsom, Surrey, is facing much higher repayments when her five-year fixed rate mortgage at 1.52% ends in October.\nThe volunteering manager said she was already cutting back her spending by going out less with friends and to the theatre.\n\"I'm petrified about what the next five years will look like and I have no idea about how I am going to find hundreds of pounds extra to pay for my mortgage,\" the 46-year-old said.\nMs Gibson said she was considering extending her mortgage term to reduce her monthly payments.\n\nWhile inflation is much lower than in recent years, households are still feeling the pain of higher prices and are set to be hit by a host of higher bills for water, energy and council tax from April.\nDirect debit failures increased by 2% in February compared with January, driven in part by people missing loan and mortgage repayments, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nTrade tariffs imposed by the US also threaten to push up prices for UK businesses exporting across the Atlantic. The Bank said most firms were in \"wait and see\" mode, as they also face a hike in National Insurance contributions (NICs) next month.\nThe Bank said UK exporters were \"nervous\" of the potential impact of tariffs.\n\"We'll be looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving,\" Mr Bailey said.\nUS President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners, sparking a trade war with the likes of the EU and Canada.\nTrump has argued the measures will boost American industry but with tariffs being paid by the domestic company importing goods, economists say the measures could lead to price rises for consumers.\nThe Bank said more firms were pausing or freezing hiring in the wake of tax rises and some had cut back on investment plans. It added pay growth for workers was set to ease over the year.\nThere have been three rate cuts since August 2024 after previous hikes to try to combat high inflation, which was driven by energy and food prices soaring in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.\nMr Bailey said the Bank expected a \"bit of a pick-up\" in inflation this year but added it would gradually fall over time.\n\"We have to be quite careful at this point,\" he said, when questioned why rates had not been cut on Thursday.\nThe theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing. \nBut it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs. \nThe Bank has forecast inflation to rise further this year to 3.7%, and stay above its 2% target until the end of 2027.\nIt previously halved its economic growth estimate for the year in a blow to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said there was \"still work to do to ease the cost of living\", adding she was \"determined to go further and faster\" to kickstart economic growth.\nBut shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget in October was to blame for inflation remaining above the Bank's target.\nLiberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper called on Reeves to reverse her decision to increase NICs for employers, arguing economic growth was being \"snuffed out\".",

Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, currently remains above the Bank's 2% target, at 3%.The Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The Bank said most firms were in \"wait and see\" mode, as they also face a hike in National Insurance contributions (NICs) next month.The Bank said UK exporters were \"nervous\" of the potential impact of tariffs. \"We have to be quite careful at this point,\" he said, when questioned why rates had not been cut on Thursday.The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",

        "article_text": "Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit were making regular trips across Ukraine's border into the Russian town of Sudzha.\nHe shows me video taken with a phone of their very last trip, as Ukrainian forces retreated from Russia's Kursk region. It shows them making their way past dozens of burnt out military and civilian vehicles.\nA soldier armed with a shotgun, their last line of defence, scans the horizon for Russian drones. Out of nowhere, one flies towards the back of their truck. Sparks fly, but they keep on going.\nArtem says they were lucky - the explosive charge was not big enough to stop them.\nAnother truck nearby was less fortunate. It was already in flames.\nArtem admits Ukraine's retreat from Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine held in Kursk, was \"not well organised\".\n\"It was pretty chaotic,\" he tells me. \"Many units left in disarray. I think the problem was the order to withdraw came too late.\"\nIt wasn't helped, he says, because units were operating without proper communications. The Starlink satellite systems they normally rely on didn't work inside Russia.\nThe 27-year-old soldier still views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful. Artem says it forced Russia to divert its forces from the east. Most of Ukraine's troops still managed to escape in time \u2013 even if for many it was on foot.\nBut he believes Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russian territory, launched last August, was too deep and too narrow - relying on just one main road for supplies and reinforcements.\nWhile Artem and his men were fleeing for their lives, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking by phone about trying to bring the war to an end. Artem says he finds that \"absurd\".\n\"To me these calls between Trump and Putin are just surreal,\" he says. \"Trump wants to end the war because he promised to do it - and Putin wants to deceive Trump to continue his war. I can't take their conversations seriously.\"\nArtem, whose home is in the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, tells me he feels disappointed with the US and Trump. \"What can I feel when they just want to give away my home?\"\nArtem says he never believed that Putin would be willing to trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories. But he still believes the Kursk offensive was important to protect its own border. Ukrainian troops may have been forced to retreat, but they still occupy high ground just over the border with Sumy.\nUkraine is continuing its cross-border raids \u2013 not just into Kursk, but Belgorod too. \nSerhiy's assault battalion helps plan these attacks \u2013 finding a way through Russian minefields and anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\".\nWe joined him on a night-time mission to locate and recover armoured vehicles in need of repairs. It's the safest time to move close to the Russian border.\nSerhiy himself is no stranger to Russia: he was born there. He now has Belorussian citizenship, but he chose to fight for Ukraine. He justifies Ukraine's incursions into his former home. Russia too, he says, has been trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory.\nTravelling in his Ukrainian-made armoured vehicle, Serhiy still lists the likely threats, now we are less than 10km from the Russian border: glide bombs, rockets and artillery, and drones fitted with thermal imaging cameras.\nHis own vehicle is fitted with electronic counter-measures to jam enemy drones, but even those won't work against drones operated via fibre optic wires. Those can't be stopped, though on some routes Ukraine has now erected netting to try to catch the drones before they can hit their target.\nOur original search near the Russian border for a damaged US-made Bradley armoured vehicle is abandoned when Serhiy receives intelligence that Russian drones are operating nearby. Instead, he tries to locate another broken-down Bradley where the risks will be smaller.\nHe and his driver still have to overcome obstacles along the way. Trees and branches lie strewn across their path \u2013 remnants from a recent Russian air strike. We see several more explosions in the distance, briefly turning the night sky orange.\nSerhiy eventually finds his broken-down Bradley. It's already been retrieved from the battlefield across the border and has been loaded onto a lorry to be taken back for repairs.\nThe Bradley commander confirms to me that they've been fighting in Russia. He describes the situations across the border as \"difficult, but we're holding on\".\nThe Bradley is another reminder of Ukraine's reliance on US military support. That now seems less certain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy says it's already clear to him that there's \"haggling behind Ukraine's back\".\nI ask Serhiy if he thinks European nations can fill any void left by the US. Is a European \"coalition of the willing\" enough to guarantee Ukraine's security? \n\"I think if America doesn't help Ukraine, then a ceasefire will be agreed soon - but on extremely unfavourable terms for Ukraine,\" Serhiy replies.\n\"Europe clearly cannot resolve this conflict alone. They're not strong enough. They've been focussing on their own economies instead of thinking about security.\"\nSerhiy says he wants the war to end. Like many Ukrainians, he would like to see peace - but not at any price.\nAdditional reporting by Volodymyr Lozkho and Anastasiia Levchenko",

Sporting announced his transfer fee as \u00a318.4m.\nHe has impressed in Spain, but has also picked up two red cards in his past four games.\nWhile Chelsea fans must wait a while to see Quenda, Essugo could join up with Enzo Maresca's side for the inaugural Fifa Club World Cup this summer in the United States.\nThe Portuguese pair are the latest young players signed by the London club, who have already confirmed moves for two other 17-year-olds this summer.\nBrazilian Estevao Willian and Ecuadorian Kendry Paez will also move to Chelsea in the summer.\nDario Essugo was given his second red card of the season against Real Betis this month\n\"He is a very creative player. He is a very young player and has a lot of potential to achieve,\" Portuguese football journalist and pundit Mariana Fernandes told BBC Sport.\n\"A right-winger with a left foot - so he has a left foot but also likes to go through opponents with his right foot, which becomes very confusing for defenders to try and stop him.\n\"He is really quick, really smart and mature in the way he transforms the game.\"\nQuenda was born in the African nation of Guinea-Bissau but moved to Portugal as a child and joined a small club on the outskirts of Lisbon. He caught the eye of Benfica scouts and spent two years in their academy before moving closer to home and joining Sporting.\nIn 2023 he signed his first professional contract and, while with the reserve team, caught the eye of ex-Sporting manager Ruben Amorim, who gave him his senior debut in the Portuguese Super Cup at the beginning of this campaign.\nAt just 17 years and 95 days, the Portugal Under-21 international became the club's youngest ever goalscorer with his strike in a 4-3 defeat by Porto.\nQuenda recorded 20 goal contributions in 33 appearances for Sporting's under-23s last season and now has 10 goals involvements in 44 games this campaign.\nWhile he was deployed on the wing to help both attack and defence under now Manchester United boss Amorim, he has moved into a more offensive role in a front three under Sporting's new head coach Rui Borges.\n\"He is a very complete player, a very put together player,\" Fernandes added. \"He has the mentality that he always has to go back and help the team to defend. He doesn't stay up front.\n\"I think the right word to describe Quenda is he is a very brave player.\n\"His main strength is one on one challenges. He is really strong on the duels with the ball at his feet. It is very rare for a defender here in Portugal to stop Quenda in a duel or one on one challenge.\"\nFernandes also told BBC Sport that Quendas had a 100m euro (\u00a384m) release clause, but that Sporting would sell for about half that price with the right negotiations.\n\"With Sporting having almost another season-and-a-half with the player, this did the trick for Chelsea to seize the opportunity,\" Fernandes said.\n\"He is going to a team that explores youth and young players and I think that is what Chelsea saw.\n\"To seize the opportunity to sign a player who in two seasons time would be double the price and would be much harder to sign.\"\nHe is impressing with his pace, strength and technical ability already, but would he be ready to step up to the Premier League level?\n\"He is a generational talent,\" Ferandes believes.\n\"The mentality is there, psychologically he is there and I think he is ready to play for Chelsea and to play in the Premier League.\n\"He will need to adapt to playing in a bigger league, a bigger club, with bigger challenges and bigger opponents.\"\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone",

We've been to two finals, a semi-final and a quarter final,\" the goalkeeper said.\n\"It's about that next step now. We know what it takes to get there. It's about what it takes to lift the trophy, and that is what the manager has come in to do,\" Pickford said.\n\"We have got Dan Burn's first call-up which is a great achievement for him. We have got Hendo with how many caps he has got. He has got that winning mentality, what he has won at Liverpool as a player and a captain.\n\"To have those leaders around the place, the more leaders you have in the team I think the more success they will bring.\n\"They will drive training standards, they will drive standards around the place and make it a better camp for everybody.\"\nHenderson joined Ajax in January 2024 after spending less than six months at Al-Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League.\nHe has made 38 appearances this season and Ajax are six points clear at the top of the Eredivisie.\n\"His desire to want to win and what he has won and achieved is driven by himself,\" Pickford said.\n\"He's a winner and a big leader. I think bringing Hendo back in is great for the squad.\n\"He was vice-captain for numerous years. He didn't come to the last Euros but he was vice-captain in 2018 to Harry [Kane].\n\"I think someone like Hendo, it's great.

        "article_text": "A court in India has sentenced three men to death for the 1981 murder of 24 people from the Dalit (formerly untouchable) community.\nThe men were part of a gang of bandits who shot the victims, including women and children, in Dehuli village in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\nThe special court said on Tuesday that the killings fell into the \"rarest of the rare\" category, which justifies capital punishment in India.\nThe men, who insist they are innocent, can appeal against the sentence in a higher court.\nAll the victims were from the Dalit community, which sits at the bottom of India's rigid caste hierarchy.\nRelatives of the victims have welcomed the sentence but say the decision should have come earlier.\n\"Justice came very late to us. The accused have lived their lives,\" said Sanjay Chaudhry, whose cousin was killed in the firing.\nThirteen of the 17 men accused in the case have died in the 44 years since the crime was committed. Apart from the three men who have been sentenced to death, there is one more accused, who is absconding.\nThe crime took place on 18 November 1981, when 17 men - most of them from the upper caste - wearing police uniforms stormed Dehuli and started shooting at villagers.\nAccording to the police complaint registered at the time, the violence followed the murder of a Dalit member of the robbers' gang by his upper-caste colleagues. The gang members then attacked the village because they suspected that some Dalit villagers were providing information to the police in the murder case.\nThe survivors of the massacre have vivid memories of the day.\n\"I was doing household chores when suddenly the firing started,\" says Rakesh Kumar, a witness who was a teenager at the time. \n\"I was hiding behind a stack of paddy and when I came out, I saw that many people, including my mother, were shot,\" he said. \nMr Kumar's mother Chameli Devi, now 80, was hit by a bullet in her leg while running from the gunfire. \n\"They did not spare anyone, including women or children,\" she said. \"Whoever they found was killed.\"\nThe firing lasted for more than four hours and the attackers fled the scene before the police arrived, according to media reports. \nThe crime led to an exodus of Dalits from Dehuli, and the local administration sent police personnel to the village, where they stayed for months in a bid to reassure people. It also triggered a political uproar, and then prime minister Indira Gandhi had visited Dehuli to meet the victims.\nIn 1984, the case was transferred from a district court to the Allahabad Sessions Court on the orders of the state's high court. The trial continued there on and off until 2024, when the case was shifted to the special court in Mainpuri which found the men guilty. \nIt's not unusual for courts in India to take decades to finish hearing a case and deliver a verdict, especially when the victims are from disadvantaged communities. In 2023, a 90-year-old man was sentenced for life in prison for a caste crime that also took place in 1981.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

The feeling persists that the American icon is not yet ready for retirement.\nA wildcard for Indian Wells was announced but then swiftly declined.

After all, Martina Navratilova won a singles match at the All England Club aged 47. \nShould Williams request a wildcard for either Wimbledon, where she is a five-time singles champion, or for the US Open, where she won the singles title twice, it seems unlikely it would be rejected.\nFashion is a big part of Williams' life and she was at Paris Fashion Week two weeks ago - one of the reasons she did not play in Indian Wells.\nShe owns the interior design company V Starr but, even though more than 30 years have passed since her professional debut, many feel she will attempt a final foray into professional tennis.\nSecond Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing\n'Sport was a big release' - how autism helps Brooksby on court\nGetting through groundhog day - how Draper became Masters champion\nIt is possible Williams, who is ranked number 1,151, will never retire. \nFormer US Open and French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova has not played since Wimbledon 2021, but is yet formally to call it a day. \nVenus' sister Serena, meanwhile, did not like the word retirement, preferring instead  to \"evolve away from the sport\" in September 2022.\nSerena's name does, however, appear on the International Tennis Integrity Agency's retired players list. \nJoining that list is a strong commitment to retiring, as any player who later changes their mind must make themselves available for drug testing for six months before returning to play.\nIt means Venus could still expect a visit from out-of-competition testers. But she no longer needs to submit details of her daily whereabouts as she was removed from the international registered testing pool last June - a usual process for singles players who drop out of the world's top 100.\nWilliams has not played frequently enough to qualify as either a full or associate member of the WTA Tour this year, but she has also not completed a WTA retirement form. \nTo play again she would need to fill out an annual player form and find a $250 administration fee from the nearly $43m of prize money she has earned. \nHer management team did not respond to a request for information about her plans and it seems Williams will keep us guessing a little longer. Any ideas she might have for the summer have not been widely shared within the sport.\nMany retirement tributes have been written and signed off a long time ago.\nThey may still need updating.",

        "article_text": "A Palestinian student activist, who was detained by US immigration officers earlier this month, has spoken out for the first time about his arrest.\nIn a letter dictated over the phone to his family from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, Mahmoud Khalil said he is a \"political prisoner\" and that he believes he was targeted for \"exercising my right to free speech\".\nBorn in Syria, Mr Khalil is a green card holder and recent graduate of Columbia University. He was a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests on campus in the spring of 2024.\nHis arrest has been linked to President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of \"un-American activity.\"\nTrump has alleged repeatedly that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, group designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest \"the first of many to come\".\nThe day after, Mr Khalil's arrest, Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed the administration's stance, posting on X: \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\nThe 30-year-old's lawyers have argued that he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. They accused the government of \"open repression of student activism and political speech\".\nIn his letter, released Tuesday, Mr Khalil said he believes he was arrested because he \"advocated for a free Palestine\".\nHe also detailed his arrest, saying he and his wife were \"accosted\" on their way home from dinner by Department of Homeland Security agents \"who refused to provide a warrant\".\n\"Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed me and forced me into an unmarked car,\" he said, adding that he was not told anything for hours, including the cause for his arrest.\nMr Khalil said he spent the night at 26 Federal Plaza, a federal office building in New York that includes an immigration court. Later, he was transported to a detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he said he was refused a blanket and forced to sleep on the ground.\nHe was transferred again to a detention facility in Louisiana, where he remains in custody. Mr Khalil's lawyers have been in court since to fight for his release.\nLast week, his lawyers pushed to bring him back to New York and accused the Trump administration of attempting to restrict access to their client. The judge did not issue a ruling at the hearing, but directed prosecutors to prove why the case should take place elsewhere.\nIn his letter, Mr Khalil called his detention \"unjust\" and said it was \"indicative of the anti-Palestinian racism that both the Biden and Trump administrations have demonstrated over the past 16 months.\"\nHe added that both administrations have \"continued to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians and prevented international intervention\". He noted Israel's resumption of air strikes on Gaza on Monday night that killed 400, according to the Hamas-run health authority.\nMr Khalil also took aim at Columbia University's leadership for its disciplining of pro-Palestinian students, saying that the school's actions laid the groundwork for students like him to be targeted.\nColumbia University has stated that law enforcement can enter campus property with a warrant, but the school denied that university leadership had invited ICE agents.\nAmid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.\nAt the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa.\nBack then, he said that he would continue protesting. But more recently, Mr Khalil's wife said her husband had grown worried about deportation, after facing online attacks that \"were simply not based in reality\".\nShe said he sent Columbia University an email asking for urgent legal help on 7 March, the day before immigration agents arrested him. Mr Khalil's wife, who is a US citizen, is now eight months pregnant.\nThe White House has continued to defend its move.\n\"This administration is not going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in our country and then siding with pro-terrorist organisations that have killed Americans,\" said Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary.\nMr Khalil said his story is a warning to others in the US, saying it is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to \"suppress dissent.\"\n\"Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs,\" he warned.",

This is particularly important in dry conditions or with older balls.\nSaliva is more effective in red-ball cricket, typically used in Tests, than in white-ball formats like ODIs and T20s.\nIn red-ball cricket, the ball is used for a longer period, allowing bowlers to shine one side and help generate reverse swing.\nIt remains unclear whether the International Cricket Council (ICC) will lift the saliva ban for red-ball cricket, following the Indian cricket board's decision to lift it for the world's richest T20 league. The ICC is led by Jay Shah, former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the world's wealthiest cricket board.\n\nThe change will come into effect from Saturday when IPL 2025 - its 18th edition - kicks off with defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) facing Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) at Eden Gardens. The tournament will feature 74 matches across 13 cities over two months.\nIndian fast bowler Mohammed Siraj, who is playing for the Gujarat Titans franchise, has welcomed the decision.\n\"It's excellent news for us bowlers because when the ball is not doing anything, applying saliva on the ball will increase the chances of finding some reverse swing,\" Siraj told Press Trust of India news agency.\n\"It sometimes aids reverse swing because scrubbing the ball against the shirt will not help [to get reverse swing]. But using saliva on the ball will help in maintaining [the shine on one side], and it is important.\"\nMohammed Shami, another Indian fast bowler, had earlier this month called on the ICC to lift the ban.\nAfter India's Champions Trophy semi-final win over Australia, he said, \"We keep appealing that we should be allowed to use saliva so that we can bring reverse swing back into the game and make it interesting.\"\nShami's plea was supported by former international bowlers Vernon Philander and Tim Southee.\nRecently, Indian spin great R Ashwin, who recently retired from international cricket, had said that he too was confused by the ban.\n\"ICC released some research papers which said that saliva did not aid reverse swing much and that not putting saliva on the ball has not made a huge difference. I don't know how they did the research, but saliva should be allowed anyways if it is not a problem,\" he said on his YouTube channel.\nSports writer Sharda Ugra says the lifting of the ban on saliva could help make the contest between bat and ball \"more even\".\nMany believe the odds are stacked against the bowlers in T20 leagues with batter-friendly wickets. The highest IPL total, set in 2013 with RCB's 263 for five against Pune, was surpassed four times in 2024. In 17 seasons, there have been 10 totals crossing 250 runs.\nHowever, Ugra adds that it's not clear how much impact the lifting of the ban will have on bowling. \n\"Saliva isn't the only factor in generating swing - conditions must also be ideal, and a skilled bowler is key,\" she told the BBC.\nSome former fast bowlers like India's Venkatesh Prasad also had a word of caution about change.\n\"The ban on applying saliva was also about maintaining cleanliness. Anything can happen today, we don't know how many - and when - a new virus enters the air. So, I think you need to be very careful in making a decision about lifting the ban,\" Prasad told The Times of India newspaper earlier this month.",

Around 600 boys join the programme each year.\nAt the end around half of them will earn extended scholarships or professional contracts while of the other half, most will end up in higher or further education, an apprenticeship, an American scholarship or part-time work in semi-pro football.\nLast year 16% of LFE apprentices went into higher or further education, with a third of those opting to study at universities in the United States.\nThey combine four years of full-time football with studying for a degree in a country where football culture is booming - a World Cup looming in 2026 and with Lionel Messi and a host of former Premier League stars now lighting up the MLS.\n\"Our trustees have always strongly believed in education alongside football development,\" said LFE chief executive officer Sarah Stephen.\n\"At some point even those who get a pro contract won't be in the game. We have to prepare them all for an alternative career, whether that's inside or outside football.\n\"Before they have even started, part of the welcome presentation is to show them where some of the boys are now - boys who aren't necessarily playing football but are out in America or some have careers playing in Sweden and are doctors, physios, firefighters.\n\"It's got to be a life-enriching experience for everyone. Ofsted said we are absolutely developing extremely resilient, confident, articulate young men ready for their next steps, whether that's as a footballer or whatever they choose to do.\"\nLFE send development mentors into clubs, provide mental health support and run a life skills programme covering issues like addiction, personal finances, sexual health, consent and, in certain regions, knife crime.\nThey also track scholars for three years after their apprenticeship ends, and provide further support where needed, while all scholars become PFA members for life.\nEach May around 200 players attend trials for released players, where 95% get some form of interest from clubs in the EFL or National League or from UK or, increasingly, US universities.\nSo, let's meet some of the kids in America...\nMaximus Rigby spent nine years playing for Leeds and shared pitches with Anthony Gordon, Jarell Quansah and Oscar Bobb before being released in 2021\nMaximus Rigby, a 21-year-old midfielder from York, was signed by Leeds United aged nine. After signing a scholarship at 16, he was released two years later in 2021. He has spent the past four years studying business marketing at Saint Francis University in Pennsylvania while playing Division One football for the Red Flash.\n\"As a kid you don't understand the dynamic of how the football industry works when you sign at that age, especially being such a high level,\" Rigby says.\n\"You're like 'wow, this is a pretty straightforward line, all I have to do is keep playing and I'm going to be there in a few years'. You realise along the way it's not like that.\n\"As you get older you start to see lads you've been with for a good period of time get released, whether they are too small, not technical, whatever the reason, then the questions start to come around you. You start to feel the pressure, this isn't a game you just sit around and enjoy any more. That's when it really hits you.\"\nAnd Rigby said things got \"really competitive\" when Leeds won promotion to the Premier League in 2020.\n\"I was parking next to Lamborghinis in my Toyota,\" he smiled. \"It shows you are so close but so far. You're training with guys that are famous millionaires, but there's that element of they are just human. \n\"When you're with them you think 'I can strive for this, for sure' \u2013 it does motivate you and you can see this is not too far away if you get a bit lucky or put in the work.\"\nRigby, though, had realised it might not work out. He didn't put \"all his eggs in one basket\" with Leeds or anywhere, attending a number of trials, which, in turn, opened the door to the States - and a culture shock at first.\n\"Going out there you have no idea what you are about to do - when I got out here after a long journey you go into a dorm room with nothing on the wall, like a prison room, you think 'I've just made the mistake of my life',\" he added.\n\"But give it a week or two and you make friends, learn so much, and you're so busy you don't miss home, you just soak in an amazing opportunity.\n\"I think a lot of people get turned off by the whole school aspect, but I think people underestimate it. You learn a lot. I have team-mates from all over the world.\n\"There's a big misconception about the style and level of the football out here. Some guys are 22 or 23 and have professional experience in France or Germany.\n\"It's been a blast, a crazy journey but one I'm thankful for, with a lot of lessons along the way.\"\nAlex Hare is in his final year at Tampa\nAlex Hare, a 22-year-old goalkeeper from Derby, played for his beloved Rams from age seven to 16 before being picked up by Sheffield Wednesday. He was released in 2021 and opted to move to the US, spending time at Missouri State and Coastal Carolina University before transferring to the University of Tampa where he will start his final season with the Spartans in August alongside a sports management degree.\n\"My dad's always been a very realistic person, so he drilled into me from a young age 'enjoy your football while you can, but don't have the idea everything is going to be sunshine and rainbows, because the chances are you're probably not going to make it',\" said Hare matter-of-factly.\n\"When I was released by Derby it was tough to take. It was like your girlfriend's dumped you x100. It's horrible, especially with it being the club you supported growing up, and still do.\"\nIt was a feeling he experienced again with Wednesday two years later - but Hare says the LFE did a good job of highlighting the routes available to him long before he was released by the Owls.\n\"Early on I recognised America as a really good pathway for me, but when you're 14 you're a typical na\u00efve footballer thinking you're going to be playing Champions League by the time you're 22,\" he added.\n\"You get to 17, 18 and reality starts to hit. You see a lot of very good players in age groups above you and it's not happening for them and you start to shift your mentality.\n\"The America route seemed great because I get a degree and I can set my future up in a better way off the pitch - it's still full time football for four years, a lot of lads who end up dropping into non-league don't get that, and I get the experience of living and going to university in America.\n\"I felt it would be a better move for me and my life and it has been, I'm very glad I did it.\"\nThanks to his coach, Hare has already had a trial with second-tier professional side the Tampa Bay Rowdies and hopes to make a career in the game when he graduates.\n\"The standard surprised me, it was a lot better than I thought it would be,\" he added. \"You don't realise how many Europeans there are. \n\"Without sounding arrogant I expected to come to Tampa, a Division Two school, with the best football resume but there's a guy here who has made an appearance for Bologna in Serie A - all of a sudden Wednesday under-18s isn't looking too impressive.\n\"I do worry if I go back to England I'd have to drop a few tiers down. I'm not sure if I'd be able to get a move where it would be worth giving up the life I have out here.\n\"I definitely want to work in football, it's my passion, whether that's going into coaching, analysis, player representation. I think I want to stay in America, there's more opportunities with the game growing, and it's 26 degrees in mid-March too.\"\nClick here to learn more about the work of the LFE , externaland for more information on youth development within the EFL, head here., external\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

As of 07:00 GMT the majority of departures had left as expected but of arrivals nine of the first 20 flights scheduled to land were cancelled. \nMore than 1,300 flights were affected on Friday, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers were told not to travel to the airport unless their airline advised them to. \nThe National Grid said that an \"interim solution\" had been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nFirefighters worked throughout the day to bring the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London, under control.\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added that when the power outage happened the back-up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening, with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nHeathrow said the airport was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, however a number of flights were cancelled and disruptions were expected to last days.\nThe closure had knock-on effects at many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nThe National Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.",

We've been to two finals, a semi-final and a quarter final,\" the goalkeeper said.\n\"It's about that next step now. We know what it takes to get there. It's about what it takes to lift the trophy, and that is what the manager has come in to do.\n\"We have got Dan Burn's first call-up which is a great achievement for him. We have got Hendo with how many caps he has got. He has got that winning mentality, what he has won at Liverpool as a player and a captain.\n\"To have those leaders around the place, the more leaders you have in the team I think the more success they will bring.\n\"They will drive training standards, they will drive standards around the place and make it a better camp for everybody.\"\nTuchel believes Henderson has all the qualities he wants to see from players in his squad.\n\"He embodies everything,\" he told ITV.\n\"He's a serial winner, his personality, character. He is the glue in every team where he played, and he will be the glue that makes things special.\"\nHenderson joined Ajax in January 2024 after spending less than six months at Al-Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League.\nHe has made 38 appearances this season and Ajax are six points clear at the top of the Eredivisie.\n\"His desire to want to win and what he has won and achieved is driven by himself,\" Pickford said.\n\"He's a winner and a big leader. I think bringing Hendo back in is great for the squad.\n\"He was vice-captain for numerous years. He didn't come to the last Euros but he was vice-captain in 2018 to Harry [Kane].\n\"I think someone like Hendo, it's great. Having leaders in your group, the teams that have won have always had that experience in the side as well.\n\"I think it's a great move for us to have someone like him in the squad. What he has done, how he is still driven - whether he plays or not he is going to be the leader on the training pitch,\" Pickford added.\nEngland reached the final of Euro 2024 under previous manager Gareth Southgate, losing to Spain, and Pickford says it is hard to know if Henderson could have helped England win their first men's trophy since 1966.\n\"We got to a final and didn't win it,\" Pickford said.\n\"Jords is a great lad and respected by all the players and the staff.\n\"I don't think we will ever know if he was a miss as we got to the final. This manager has brought Hendo in and I know how much of a leader he is, and how respected he is, so I think it's only a good thing.\"",

That doesn't include the Wellingtons, Blenheims, Hurricanes, Mosquitos\u2026 she flew 82 different types.\"\nBut the ATA's women were often met with disbelief and ridicule, with fighter pilots sometimes refusing to hand over their aircraft and officers accusing the \"silly girls\" of poor flying after they had skilfully wrestled damaged planes to the ground.\n\"They got over all the prejudice with humour most of the time,\" said Ms Adkins.\n\"Whenever there was a crash, there was an inquiry to see whether it was the pilot or the plane's fault and it was always the plane's fault.\n\"Mum said she landed many a plane without undercarriage.\"\nOut of 168 women in the ATA, 16 died, but despite the danger and discrimination, the women regarded their jobs as a privilege.\n\"At her age it was a big adventure,\" said Ms Adkins. \"They took the prejudice because they felt amazingly lucky.\n\"There weren't loos, there were only urinals, so they used to go behind the hangar.\n\"They could not eat in the mess because they were women so they use to eat outside with their food on a tray.\n\"Their uniform was a skirt. Eventually they were allowed to wear trousers for flying but, even then, there was a sign outside saying 'will women please remove their trousers before entering the mess'.\"\nMs Adkins said, on one occasion, her mother was promoted but it was quickly withdrawn.\nShe also wrote to obtain official dispatches to prove her mother had gained her RAF wings in 1953 because people within the air force did not believe her.\n\"They did not get medals, they weren't even allowed to get promoted,\" said Ms Adkins.\n\"She was promoted by mistake.\n\"Her commandant thought she was good and sent off for her to be promoted and they issued it, then withdrew it.\n\"She was immensely proud of getting her RAF wings, which no one believed.\n\"That must have been so hard in her lifetime, that RAF people did not believe her.\"\nAfter the war, Mrs Moggridge completed her commercial flight training.\nBut when she made history by becoming Britain's first woman airline captain, she was not allowed to speak on the plane's tannoy in case the passengers were alarmed to hear a woman's voice.\nMrs Moggridge died in 2004 and her ashes were scattered over Dunkeswell Airfield, Devon, from a Spitfire.\nThe aircraft was ML407, which she had been the first to fly in 1944, straight from the factory.\nMs Adkins continues her mother's legacy by giving talks at airfields, clubs and events.\n\"I think it's really important to get the story out there,\" she said.\n\"There are no books or films with women pilots.

His symptoms could include aggression towards peers, faculty or objects, and he received suspensions last fall following outbursts.\nRebecca said the school district isolated her son from his peers for months, with only special education teachers and limited faculty for contact.\nIn October 2024, Rebecca filed a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights alleging the school violated federal disability law and her son had been \"discriminated against and denied a free appropriate public education\". She alleged the school only allowed him to \"attend school for two hours per school day and in a 1:1 segregated setting\". Hours were gradually added back, Rebecca said, but he remained isolated. The school district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThough Rebecca had a private lawyer and an education advocate, an OCR lawyer in the Cleveland office was facilitating mediation with the school district as soon as April.\nBut before that could happen, the Trump administration fired the Cleveland office's entire staff, including the attorney helping Rebecca's son, throwing her case - and others like it - into limbo. \n\"I don't have any other option for this kid,\" said Rebecca, who asked the BBC to withhold her last name and her son's name to protect his privacy. \"They're playing politics with my little boy. And I don't think that's fair.\"\nThe sudden firings, and ensuing confusion, were precursors of President Donald Trump's next big move: to try and dismantle the Department of Education entirely.\nOn Thursday, he signed an executive order that directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin to \"facilitate the closure\" of the department. Congress, not the president, actually holds the power to dismantle a federal agency, and the order will likely spark legal challenges. \nBut the move has left many Americans like Rebecca uncertain about their children's future.\n\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt told media on Thursday that while the department will not be shut down completely, what will remain will be much smaller, and will focus on \"critical functions,\" such as federal student loans.\nOCR, she said, will be greatly reduced in \"scale and the size\".\nCuts have already begun: On 11 March, the Trump administration made drastic cuts to the department using a process known as a reduction in force, halving its staff. \nMcMahon said the downsizing showed a \"commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.\"\nAlthough the Department of Education has little oversight over the day to day operations of most schools in the US, it plays a key role in enforcing federal education guidelines and policies.\nThe Office for Civil Rights was one of the hardest hit divisions in that first round of firings. The administration shuttered 7 of the 12 regional offices, including major metropolitan areas like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco. \nThis month, as Rebecca and her husband tried to figure out what the changes at the department meant for their son's case, the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office received an email that their unit was \"being abolished\" \u2013 along with their positions.\nThe news left one Cleveland attorney who works on disability cases with a \"complete feeling of desperation.\"\nThe attorney worried not only about the individual cases still underway, they told the BBC.\n\"The effect of each individual case is sometimes much bigger, in terms of educating the school and making good for the others in the district,\" said the attorney, who requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the administration. \nParents and OCR attorneys had long been frustrated with the agency's growing backlog and diminishing staff. They fear new cuts will make it impossible for the already overwhelmed division to handle the tens of thousands of complaints it receives each year.\nTasked with making sure schools are following America's civil rights laws, the OCR's job is to help ensure that students are not discriminated against because of their disability, sex, race or religion. Remedies the office helps institute could be as straightforward as adding accessibility features to school buildings or seating a near-sighted child at the front of the class. But the office also tackles complex cases involving discrimination or bullying, as well as sexual harassment and assault.\nBefore his executive order, there were already signs that the office's mission was changing. \nOCR staff had received guidance for the office to prioritise cases involving antisemitisim, the AP reported. Craig Trainor, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, has said they will take on cases involving transgender athletes at universities in order to combat \"radical transgender ideology\".\nOn 14 March, the Department of Education said it had launched investigations into more than 50 universities as part of the administration's move to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, which it views as exclusionary. \nStaffers who remained in their jobs said the Department of Education's new leadership had provided little to no guidance about how thousands of pending cases, including Rebecca's, would be reassigned. They also worried that cases involving racial minorities, or people with disabilities, will not receive the appropriate attention.\nThe office received a record 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, according to OCR's annual report. Headcount had declined even as cases increased over the years. In 1981, OCR had 1,100 full time employees. By 2024, it was down to 588.\n\"We were already so incredibly flooded with cases,\" the Cleveland attorney said. \"I was never proud of our processing time.\"\nWith the new cuts, they said, \"this work will not be able to be done\".\nBut parents and educators say they will not let the Department of Education be shut down without a fight. Nikki Carter, a mother and disability advocate in Alabama, is one of two plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, which is suing the Department of Education, McMahon, and Trainor over the mass job cuts.\nThe lawsuit alleges that McMahon's actions have stalled Ms Carter's racial discrimination case that was being handled by the OCR and she \"has received no indication that the investigation has resumed\".\n\"There was a lack of communication throughout the entirety of the process,\" Ms Carter told the BBC. \"When the Trump administration came in, it made that situation even worse and even more difficult.\"\nDespite her frustrations with OCR, she believed the office was still necessary to help victims of racial discrimination. She hoped the lawsuit would not only restore the office, but improve it.\n\"Children, family, as well as advocates, they don't get due process,\" Ms Carter said. \"They are being denied just basic federal educational rights. And so when you can't get that on the local and state level, the only hope that we have is to turn to the federal government.\n\"We do need OCR to go back to work,\" she said. \"And we also need OCR to be accountable for their actions \u2013 or lack thereof.\"\nMeanwhile, Rebecca has transferred her son to a district school for students with emotional impairments. But she still wants OCR to negotiate special tutoring for her son, and to educate the district staff about how to help students like him. She recently learned her son's case would transfer to the still-operating Denver office, but has received no other updates.\n\"He was treated so poorly and differently because of the way his brain was structured,\" she said. \"I want to see somebody held accountable for the way he was treated.\" ",

Israel's Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara - a vocal critic of Netanyahu who is herself facing dismissal proceedings - argued that Mr Bar could not be fired until the legality of the move had been assessed.A letter sent to sent by Netanyahu to members of his government ahead of the meeting referenced a \"persistent loss of professional and personal trust\" between the prime minister and Mr Bar, and proposed his term end on 20 April. \"The loss of professional trust has been consolidated during the war, beyond the operational failure of 7 October [2023], and in particular in recent months,\" it said, referring to the Hamas attacks on Israel which sparked the Israel-Gaza war.About 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage during the attacks.

        "article_text": "It seems astounding that a single fire at an electricity source shut down one of the world's busiest airports.\nThe disruption to the journeys of thousands of passengers and millions of tonnes of trade goods on Friday has prompted a series of questions over the resilience of the UK's major infrastructure. \nDisaster recovery plans keep the top brass of many organisations awake at night.\nBanks, data centres, stock exchanges, hospitals, all have contingency plans. \n\"How is it that critical infrastructure - of national and global importance - is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative?\", said Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association,  which represents airlines.\nHe said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\".\nHeathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\".\nThat meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use.\nThis is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.\nHeathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.\nA source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.\nThe systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.\nA Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.\nThe problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.\nThere are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.\nIt appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.\n\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"\nHowever, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.\n\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.\nIn 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.\nIt followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors. \n\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.\nA Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.\nSometimes - like now -  a chain is only important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.\nQuestions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going.\nReporting by Tom Espiner, Theo Leggett, Ben King, and Oliver Smith.",

        "article_text": "This story contains details of someone taking their own life, which some readers may find distressing.\nThe family of a Boeing whistleblower who took his own life last year has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company.\nThe complaint alleges that John Barnett was subjected to a campaign of harassment, abuse and humiliation after he raised concerns about safety issues.\nIt claims that the conduct of the company was \"the clear, foreseeable cause\" of Mr Barnett's death.\nBoeing said it was saddened by Mr Barnett's death and extended its condolences to his family.\nThe former Boeing manager was found dead from what police described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the car park of a Charleston hotel on 9 March last year.\nThe 146-page lawsuit has been brought by his mother, Vicky Stokes, and his brothers Rodney and Michael on behalf of his estate. It was filed on Wednesday in the US District Court of South Carolina.\nIt attributes his death to Boeing's actions, including what it describes as a retaliatory campaign by his managers that amounted to a \"hostile work environment\".  \n\"Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,\" it says.\nIt describes Mr Barnett as a dedicated, idealistic worker who \"took his role seriously in protecting the flying public\" and \"believed that he had a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure\u2026 that every possible defect was identified, documented and remedied.\"\nIt describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company.\nMr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him.\nAmong the exhibits put forward in support of the claim are an email, in which he says, \"Boeing has completely destroyed my outlook on life\" and his handwritten final note, which says \"I can't do this any longer!! Enough!!\"\nJohn Barnett worked for Boeing for 32 years. \nFrom 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.\nDuring his time at the factory, Mr Barnett raised a number of concerns with management about violations of safety procedures, as well as about defects in aircraft on the production line.\nHe later took his concerns to the media. In 2019, he told the BBC that:\nBoeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.\nIt established that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.\nOn the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly\". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.\nSafety standards at Boeing have come under a harsh spotlight since an incident last year in which a disused door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max aircraft shortly after takeoff. \nThe incident, which came five years after two previous catastrophic accidents involving the 737 Max, brought intense scrutiny of the company's quality control procedures and conditions in the factory. \nThe company appointed a new chief executive last year, industry veteran Kelly Ortberg, and has produced a detailed action plan to address concerns raised by regulators about issues on the factory floor.\nIn response to the lawsuit being filed, Boeing issued a brief statement. \n\"We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family,\" it said.\nPreviously, however, the company has pushed back against the allegations made against it, telling the BBC: \"Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety.\"\nIt also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.\nIt added: \"We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously.\"\nIf you have been affected by the issues in this story, you can find support from the BBC's Action Line.",

        "article_text": "Farmers are turning bees into unexpected helpers to keep elephants off their crops.\nAround the world, spreading farmland is increasingly overlapping with elephant habitats, often resulting in dangerous interactions as elephants roam over people's crops. But in Kenya, after decades of investigation, researchers have come up with a simple but ingenious solution to deter elephants: strings of beehive fences.\nInspired by longtime local knowledge of elephants' dislike of beehives, these buzzing barriers are offering a gentle but effective way of de-escalating the sometimes-violent interactions between farmers and elephants. And they are now spreading across the world, from Mozambique to Thailand.\nSo what is it about bees that elephants hate so much? And can they really be expected to keep the peace in this ever more crowded world?\nHuman-elephant conflict is a growing issue in several areas. In Kenya, where the population and demand for resources is growing, human-inhabited areas are increasingly overlapping with elephant's ranges. Combined with the recovery of some elephant populations, this is leading to greater chance of conflict between humans and these giants.\n\"Expansion of agricultural land, logging, urbanisation, and shrinking and fragmentation of elephant habitats \u2013 wildlife that require large spaces of land \u2013 [are] forcing elephants to enter human settlements in search of food and water,\" says Greta Francesca Iori, an Ethiopia-based advisor on elephant conservation and human-elephant conflict for several governments and non-profits.\n\"Wherever there are elephants, there are instances and information coming through of human-elephant conflict.\"\nGraeme Shannon, a wildlife ecologist at Bangor University in Wales, UK, who has studied African elephants for two decades, notes that the people pushed into these areas are often of poorer backgrounds. \"So farming is crucial for them and their families.\"\nBut water and lush, highly nutritional crops can be very appealing for elephants, leading them close to human settlements.\nPeople take a lot of time caring for their land, then the elephants come \"when you have planted the crops and they are almost mature\", says Emmanuel Mwamba, a farmer who lives in Mwakoma, Kenya, a village at the frontline of human-elephant conflict. \"If elephants come there\u2026 everything is gone.\"\n\"Some of us [\u2026] rely on crops for subsistence\", adds Mwamba. \"Imagine if that was destroyed within a night.\"\nSuch encounters can be fatal for both sides. Farmers can die trying to stop hungry, seven-tonne elephants from entering their crops, while the elephants can end up getting killed by humans for happening upon a good meal.\nTo prevent these conflicts, scientists and locals have spent decades testing a variety of solutions to deter elephants, from electric fences, watchtowers and solar spotlights to chilli-greased bricks and smelly elephant repellents, or even simply using noises to scare the elephants \u2013 all with their own pros and cons.\nBut using bees to scare away elephants has emerged as a particularly promising and efficient tool, combining effective deterrence with a host of other benefits for farmers.\nIt all started back in the early 2000s, when Fritz Vollrath, an ecologist at the University of Oxford and chairman of charity Save the Elephants, and Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save The Elephants, heard a folklore story from Kenyan pastoralists about how trees in certain areas were not damaged by elephants because they had beehives in them.\nInspired by the tale, Vollrath and Douglas-Hamilton began working with Lucy King, co-existence director at Save the Elephants, to investigate scientifically whether bees could really scare the giant pachyderms. By 2007 their research had led them to conclude that elephants not only stay away from trees containing beehives of wild African honeybees, but \"also rumble to each other to tell each other to stay away\", King says. \"We know that they can get stung, and we know that they never forget.\"\nKing designed a tool farmers could use to protect their crops from hungry elephants: a fence made of beehives. She first tested the idea in 2008 in a community in Laikipia, Kenya, which suffered from regular elephant crop-raids.\nThe fence goes all around a farm, with hives placed every 10m (33ft) between two posts. Lured in with natural attractants such as beeswax and lemongrass oil, African honeybees naturally colonise the beehives.\n\"For one acre [0.4 hectares] of farmland, you need 24 beehives,\" King says. However, just 12 of these are real: every other one is a dummy beehive \u2013 a fake made of just a yellow piece of plywood that gives the elephants the illusion that there are more beehives than there really are. This reduces costs and gives more space to the bees. \"As an elephant approaches in the dark, and they can smell bees, and they can smell honey, they can see a load of yellow boxes. They don't know which one is real and which one is fake. So it's an illusion. And it seems to work,\" King says.\nOther than deterring elephants from the crops and so providing food security, the beehive fences can bring other benefits to the communities who use them.\nFor one thing, they can generate an additional income for the farmers by producing honey. \"If a farmer has honey and has crops, it's actually good enough for the family to go on,\" says Mwamba, who lives in one of the villages where the beehive fences have been tested and has now become a beehive fence project officer for Save the Elephants, teaching other farmers how to build and maintain the fences.\nWomen are \"often disproportionately impacted by human elephant conflict\", adds King: it's often women who work in the farms and need to scare the elephants away, risking injury. For them, \"feeling more empowered in their situations means that they can actually get on with the job of looking after their household, maybe going back to school, maybe making sure they have time to do the other things\", King says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The farmers protecting Nepal's snow leopards\n\u2022\u00a0Why Vermont farmers are using urine on their crops\n\u2022\u00a0Why some animals thrive on being alone\u00a0\nOver the years, King and other researchers have collected a body of evidence about the efficiency of beehive fences in Kenya, and today the fences are being tried and studied in dozens of other countries including Tanzania, Mozambique and Sri Lanka. Proof of the method's efficiency also comes from Thailand, another country where human-elephant conflict is an everyday issue.\nIn 2024, King and her colleagues published a long-term study that analysed the effectiveness of beehive fences over nine years in two small villages in southern Kenya: Mwambiti and Mwakoma, where Emmanuel Mwamba lives. These communities are highly reliant on crops, such as cabbage and maize, that attract the many elephants that cross between the East and West side of Tsavo National Park, which hosts around 15,000 elephants \u2013 the largest population in Kenya.\nThe researchers worked in close contact with locals, installing and collecting data on the beehive fences. Out of almost 4,000 elephants which approached the beehive fences, 75% of them were deterred by the fences, the study found. The farmers also made $2250 (\u00a31,740) from selling honey.\n\"I think it's ingenious,\" says Shannon, who wasn't involved in the research. \"You've got this natural mechanism by which you can deter these animals from approaching farms. I just think it's brilliant.\"\nStill, the study also revealed some of the weaknesses of the tool, Shannon adds. For example, the bee populations plummeted during drought years due to a lack of flowering plants. In 2018, when the hives were still recovering from the previous year's drought, an unusually large number of elephants entered the villages, and the fences managed to deter only around 73%. \"Like any single method or any single tool, it has caveats and limitations to how effective it can be,\" says Shannon.\nKing says she also worries about the impact of climate change on beehive fences, \"because if you have these erratic droughts happening every four years, rather than every 15-20 years like they used to happen, you're in trouble because the bees don't recover in time\". Excessive rain can also be a problem for the bees, she adds, as it can knock flowers down from trees and bushes.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nA solution, the researchers suggest, is implementing other tools which can work together with the beehive fences, such as chilli briquettes or watchtowers. \"Without question, there is no one solution,\" says King.\nBut thinking on a larger scale, says Iori, while such local solutions can be helpful in mitigating human-elephant conflict, they can be put at risk by both climatic and geopolitical shocks, which in turn can \"significantly reduce people's belief\" in them. \"We need to have always a multi-pronged approach, where you're also dealing with higher level issues of: How do we engage government? How do we create belief? How do we reduce the pressure, both on elephants and people, at a systemic level\u2026 which is often to do with a lot more complex things,\" she says.\nFor now, though, the beehive fences are helping Mwamba's and other communities. \"We started with two beehive fences. Now we have 700 hives covering three villages,\" says Mwamba. \"It's a good thing for the community right now.\" Nowadays, he adds, people believe they need to co-exist with elephants.\nBefore the introduction of beehive fences, \"the elephants had crop-raided most of the farms here,\" Mwamba recalls. \"Right now, people can easily live without fear.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

It's a good thing for the community right now \u2013 Emmanuel MwambaIt all started back in the early 2000s, when Fritz Vollrath, an ecologist at the University of Oxford and chairman of charity Save the Elephants, and Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save The Elephants, heard a folklore story from Kenyan pastoralists about how trees in certain areas were not damaged by elephants because they had beehives in them.Save the ElephantsStudies have found bees are an effective way of deterring elephants away from crops (Credit: Save the Elephants)Inspired by the tale, Vollrath and Douglas-Hamilton began working with Lucy King, co-existence director at Save the Elephants, to investigate scientifically whether bees could really scare the giant pachyderms. Farmers can die trying to stop hungry, seven-tonne elephants from entering their crops, while the elephants can end up getting killed by humans for happening upon a good meal.To prevent these conflicts, scientists and locals have spent decades testing a variety of solutions to deter elephants, from electric fences, watchtowers and solar spotlights to chilli-greased bricks and smelly elephant repellents, or even simply using noises to scare the elephants \u2013 all with their own pros and cons.But using bees to scare away elephants has emerged as a particularly promising and efficient tool, combining effective deterrence with a host of other benefits for farmers.We started with two beehive fences.

        "article_text": "Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.\nTo get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.\nBut he got much more attention than he bargained for. \nMr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.\nThe Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.\nMr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.\n\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.\nEventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.\nWaymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.\nThe company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".\nNevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.\nLast year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.\nAnd in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .\nThe road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.\nIn December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.\nGM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".\nIn October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.\nMeanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.\nUber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020. \nBut some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.\nWaymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.\nSo why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?\n\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.\nHe points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.\n\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"\nSo what's next?\nRegions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.\nThat would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.\n\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.\nHe also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.\n\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says. \nIt will be a slow process. \n\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker. \n\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds. \nAnd the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns. \n\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.\nFor those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.\n\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.\n\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.\n\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.\n\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.\n\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"\nTo see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China. \nIn the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.\nAcross the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.\n\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.\nBack in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.\n\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

England sack coach Lewis after Ashes humiliationImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jon Lewis was appointed head coach of the England women's team in November 2022Stephan ShemiltChief Cricket ReporterPublished6 hours ago326 CommentsEngland have sacked head coach Jon Lewis following a shambolic Ashes series in which they suffered a 16-0 clean sweep against Australia.Lewis, who was appointed in November 2022, has been removed after a review of the tour led by England director of women's cricket Clare Connor.The former England seamer met with Connor and high-performance manager Jonathan Finch last week.Lewis becomes the first casualty of the humiliating tour of Australia, which was the first time either side has lost every match in an Ashes series since the multi-format points system was introduced in 2013.That demolition came at the end of a winter where England suffered a calamitous early exit at the T20 World Cup. \"What next for England after Lewis' sacking?Published3 hours agoFormer captain Edwards wants to help England rebuildPublished13 FebruaryECB boss 'can't believe' 16-0 Women's Ashes lossPublished2 FebruaryCandidates to replace Lewis could include former England captain Charlotte Edwards and the identically named Jon Lewis, who is in charge of the England A team. \"We must be ready for an exciting summer of international cricket and to challenge for two World Cups over the next 15 months, including the T20 World Cup in this country next year. \"Under his leadership the team held off Australia to draw a thrilling 2023 Women's Ashes - attracting record crowds with an entertaining brand of cricket \u2013 while the team's consistent success in bilateral cricket included a remarkable eight consecutive ODI series wins for which he should take real credit,\" she said.",

Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity. \nBut observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.\n\nAlthough we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.\nSeveral experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.\nLast year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away. \nInstead, a year on, that blip has grown.\n\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth\n\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.\nThe data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.\n\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.\n\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done. \n\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"\nSo what is causing the variation?\n\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.\n\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"\nDESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.\n\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.\nMore details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.\nThe DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK.",

        "article_text": "Protests have erupted in Turkey after authorities detained the mayor of Istanbul, just days before he was due to be selected as a presidential candidate.\nEkrem Imamoglu, from the secular Republican People's Party (CHP), is seen as one of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's strongest political rivals.\nProsecutors accused him of corruption and aiding a terrorist group, calling him a \"criminal organisation leader suspect\".\nPolice detained 100 people - including other politicians, journalists and businessmen - as part of the investigation, and the Istanbul governor's office has imposed four days of restrictions in the city.\nImamoglu said online \"the will of the people cannot be silenced\". \nProtesters have taken to the streets and university campuses, and in underground stations, with crowds chanting anti-government slogans. It is a display of public anger not seen in years.\nThere were reports of clashes between protesters and police in Turkey's largest city. Footage from Reuters news agency shows police using pepper spray to disperse crowds outside Istanbul University.\nThousands of people rallied in the cold in front of the city hall, shouting: \"Erdogan, dictator!\" and \"Imamoglu, you are not alone!\"\nThe government has banned public gatherings in Istanbul as part of the four days of restrictions. But more protests are anticipated nationwide as opposition leaders, including Imamoglu's wife, urge people to \"raise their voices\".\nMany streets in Istanbul have also been closed to traffic, while some metro lines have also cancelled their services.\nIn a social media video Imamoglu said he filmed while police were outside his home, he vowed to \"stand resolute\" for the people of Turkey \"and all who uphold democracy and justice worldwide\".\nAnd in a handwritten note posted on his X account after his arrest, he said the people of Turkey would respond to \"the lies, the conspiracies and the traps\" against him.\nUK-based internet watchdog Netblocks said on Wednesday Turkey had severely restricted access to social media sites like X, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.\nThe arrest comes as part of a major crackdown nationwide in recent months, targeting opposition politicians, municipalities, journalists and figures in the entertainment industry.\nFollowing the Istanbul mayor's arrest, concerns over Turkey's shift toward autocracy were expressed on social media, with some calling for an opposition boycott of the upcoming presidential elections, arguing that a fair and democratic vote is no longer possible.\nImamoglu's party, the CHP, even condemned the arrests as \"a coup against our next president\", a sentiment widely echoed by pro-opposition voices.\nBut Turkey's justice minister criticised those who linked Erdogan to the arrests. \nYilmaz Tunc said it was \"extremely dangerous and wrong\" to suggest this was a political move, insisting that nobody was above the law in Turkey.\nErdogan and his party have also denied the claims, insisting that Turkey's judiciary is independent. He has been in power for 22 years.\nLast year, Imamoglu won a second term as Istanbul's mayor, when his CHP party swept local elections there and in Ankara. \nIt was the first time since Erdogan came to power that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box.\nThe elections were also a personal blow to the president, who grew up in and became mayor of Istanbul on his rise to power. \nDozens of police officers were involved in the early-morning raid on Imamoglu's house in Istanbul.\nThe CHP's presidential candidate selection, in which Imamoglu is the only person running, is set to take place on Sunday.\nImamoglu's arrest came a day after Istanbul University annulled his degree due to alleged irregularities - a decision which, if upheld, would prevent him from running in presidential elections. \nAccording to the Turkish constitution, presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\nImamoglu called that move \"legally baseless\", adding that universities \"must remain independent, free from political interference and dedicated to knowledge\".\nPresidential elections are currently scheduled for 2028. Erdogan cannot currently run for office again, as he is in his second term and previously served as prime minister before that. \nThe only way Erdogan could contest another election would be to change the constitution, or call an early election before his term ends. \nAs well as being accused of extortion and fraud, Imamoglu is also alleged to have aided the PKK.\nThe PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - has waged an insurgency since 1984, and is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.\nEarlier this month the group announced its decision to lay down arms, following a call from its imprisoned leader, who had engaged in talks with Turkish officials.\nInternational reaction to the arrest has been negative, with EU, French and German officials all condemning the arrests. \nA Council of Europe statement said the detention of Imamoglu \"bears all the hallmarks of the pressure on a political figure considered as one of the main candidates in forthcoming presidential elections.\"\nThe Turkish lira, meanwhile, briefly crashed to an all-time low against the US dollar, as markets reacted poorly to the political uncertainty.\nWhile many were shocked to wake up to the news of Imamoglu's arrest, legal pressure on the popular opposition leader is far from new.\nHe has faced multiple investigations and was handed a political ban in December 2022 over allegations of insulting Turkey's electoral board in 2019 - a verdict he appealed, with the final ruling still pending.\nAdditionally, he has been the subject of cases related to alleged tender irregularities during his tenure as mayor of Istanbul's Beylikduzu district.\nMore recently, on 20 January, a new case was filed against him over his criticism of a prosecutor.",

He accused Carey of  exploiting his \"popularity\" and \"style\".\nMr Stone, who performs under the name Vince Vance, was claiming at least $20m (\u00a316m) in damages.\nBut in her ruling, Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani cited expert testimony saying the two songs  simply shared \"Christmas song clich\u00e9s\" that were common to several earlier hits.\nMr Stone and his lawyers had not \"met their burden of showing that [the songs by] Carey and Vance are substantially similar\", she wrote.\nJudge Almandi also ruled that Mr Stone and his lawyers should face sanctions for filing \"frivolous\" arguments, that included \"vague... and incomprehensible mixtures of factual assertions and conclusions, subjective opinions, and other irrelevant evidence\".\nShe ordered Mr Stone and his lawyers to repay the legal bills Carey incurred in defending the case.\nThe case was originally filed in 2022, with Mr Stone claiming Carey's hit was copied from a song he'd recorded under the name Vince Vance and the Valiants.\nIn court papers, he claimed his track had received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 holiday season - a year before Carey's song was recorded and released.\nIn her 2020 memoir, Carey said she had composed \"most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard\", while playing the movie It's A Wonderful Life for inspiration, before completing it in the studio with her co-writer Walter Afanasieff.\nBut Mr Stone rejected that account.\n\"[Carey] palmed off these works with her incredulous origin story, as if those works were her own,\" he said in court papers. \"Her hubris knowing no bounds, even her co-credited songwriter doesn't believe the story she has spun.\"\nThe initial complaint was dropped in December 2022, but refiled a month later.\nMr Stone had hoped to share in the song's runaway success. All I Want For Christmas Is You earns about $8.5 million (\u00a36.6 million) every year; and has spent 140 weeks in the UK's top 100.\nCarey's lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case last August, arguing that Mr Stone had failed to establish copyright infringement.\n\"The claimed similarities are an unprotectable jumble of elements: A title and hook phrase used by many earlier Christmas songs, other commonplace words, phrases, and Christmas tropes like 'Santa Claus' and 'mistletoe',\" they wrote.\nIn Wednesday's ruling, Judge Almadani endorsed two reports from musicologists hired by Carey's team.\nIn one, New York University professor Lawrence Ferrara testified there were \"no significant melodic similarities\" between the two tracks.\nHe added he'd discovered \"at least 19 songs\" predating Mr Stone's track that had similar lyrical ideas - several of which were also called All I Want For Christmas Is You.\nA similar report filed by the defence was ruled inadmissible - especially after its author admitted in a deposition that the melodies of the two songs were incomparable because \"the rhythms are different\".\nOn that basis, Judge Almadani ruled in favour of the motion to dismiss.\nNeither Mariah Carey nor Mr Stone were immediately available for comment on the ruling.",

        "article_text": "Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.\nData leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.\nThe BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.\nEcopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.\nThe company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.\nThe huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.\nMembers of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.\nThe wider area is home to endangered river turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, and is part of a species-rich hotspot in one of the world's most biodiverse countries. Nearby wetlands include a protected habitat for jaguars.\nWhen the BBC visited last June, families were fishing together in waterways criss-crossed by oil pipelines.\nOne local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.\nIn places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.\nA fisherman dived down in the water and brought up a clump of vegetation caked in dark slime.\nPointing to it, Yuly Vel\u00e1squez, president of Fedepesan, a federation of fishing organisations in the region, said: \"This is all grease and waste that comes directly from the Ecopetrol refinery.\"\nEcopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.\nIn response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.\nAndr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.\nHe joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".\nMr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"\nHe left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.\nOne database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.\nEcopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.\nMr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".\n\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.\nThe BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.\nEcopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.\n\"I say to you with complete confidence that there is not, and was not any policy nor any instruction saying, 'these things can't be shared',\" he said.\nMr Bay\u00f3n blamed sabotage for many oil spills.\nColombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.\nHe also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.\nHowever, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.\nFigures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.\nAsked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".\nThe firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.\nIt says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.\nThe data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.\nThe fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.\nShe said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.\nIt is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.\nA 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.\nMr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.\n\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.\nMr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.\nMs Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.\nShe said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.\nThe fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.\nAsked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".\n\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.\nMs Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.\nExperts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.\nDespite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.\nMatthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.\nBut he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.\nPrivate security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.\nMr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.\n\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.\nHe says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that the Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".\nMr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.\nEcopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.\nThe BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.\nNow living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.\nHe has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.\n\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.\nMr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.\n\"We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,\" he said. \"I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.\"\nAnd Ms Vel\u00e1squez remains determined to continue speaking out, despite the threats.\n\"If we don't go fishing, we don't eat,\" she said. \"If we speak and report, we are killed\u2026  And if we don't report, we kill ourselves, because all these incidents of heavy pollution are destroying the environment around us.\"",

        "article_text": "With its creepy CGI dwarfs and muddled tone, Disney's latest live-action remake is \"not calamitous\" but is a \"a mind-boggling mash-up\".\nLive-action remakes of Disney cartoons aren't usually given a warm welcome by critics and commentators, but none of them has faced as much hostility as the new remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Are we succumbing to Disney Princess Fatigue? Maybe, but there's more to it than that. One issue is that the 1937 original was Walt Disney's first ever full-length animated film, and, while parts of it have aged badly, it still stands up as an exquisite, heart-lifting masterpiece. Remaking a revered, all-time great animation as a live-action film is about as sensible as remaking Singin' in the Rain as a cartoon.\nAnother issue is that Disney's Snow White \u2013 to use its official title \u2013 has been attacked from both sides of the political spectrum: it has been condemned for being too progressive (\"A Disney princess renowned for her pale skin being played by an actress with Colombian heritage? How dare they?\"), and not progressive enough (\"Caricatured dwarfs in this day and age? How dare they?\"). Throw in the pronouncements on the Israel-Gaza war made by its stars, Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, and you've got a perfect storm of bad publicity.\nThe good news for the studio is that the film itself is not so calamitous. It's not the worst of the studio's live-action remakes (that's Robert Zemeckis's straight-to-streaming dud, Pinocchio), and while it's not the best, either, it's undoubtedly the most fascinating. What's so unique about Disney's Snow White is that it seems as if some of the producers wanted to make an old-fashioned tribute to a feudal fairy tale, and the others wanted to make a revisionist, Marxist call-to-arms. Rather than settling on one option or the other, the producers apparently compromised by making both versions at once, so the results are like a mind-boggling mash-up of two different films.\nFor the first few scenes, what we get is the subversive version. In an overlong opening sequence, we hear that Snow White (Zegler) isn't named after her skin colour, as the traditional story would have it, but after the blizzard that was blowing when she was born. It's not entirely clear why the King and Queen chose to name their daughter in honour of the weather, but considering\u00a0 she could have been called Drizzle or Gusty Wind, she should probably count herself lucky. The exposition continues with speeches and songs about the days when Snow White's benign parents ruled \"a kingdom for the free and the fair\", where \"the bounty of the land belonged to all who tended it\". This has to be the closest a Disney princess film has got to paraphrasing The Communist Manifesto.\nThere are more of these radical ideas when Snow White's mother dies, and the King marries a woman who becomes the Evil Queen (Gadot). She warns her subjects of \"a terrible threat beyond the southern kingdom\", and then exploits their fears to nab the realm's riches for herself. With that, Disney's Snow White becomes one of the year's most bluntly political films \u2013 Disney or otherwise. And this is all before Snow White meets her handsome love interest, Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), who is no longer a prince, but the Robin Hood-like leader of a gang of thieves. After he tells Snow White to \"stop thinking and start doing\", she sings Waiting on a Wish, a song about taking action rather than hoping that things will change for the better. It's a forceful riposte to Disney's earliest fairy-tale cartoons, and leaves you startled by the boldness of the director, Marc Webb, and the writer, Erin Cressida Wilson. As for those people who complained that the trailer felt a bit \"woke\"? Well, just wait until they see the film.\nOnce Snow White flees from her homicidal stepmother and hides in the forest, though, her story suddenly turns into a faithful if robotic recreation of the 1937 cartoon. The forest itself looks like a Disneyland ride, with its artificially bright flowers and big-eyed woodland creatures; Zegler looks like a theme-park employee in Snow White's trademark puffy-sleeved dress; and the CGI dwarfs look like creepy animatronic puppets of the classic characters. Choosing to use these weirdly photorealistic digital avatars, rather than putting real actors on the screen, was Webb's worst misjudgement, but this section of the film still works well enough as an homage to the cartoon. Zegler, Gadot and their colleagues all do serviceable jobs, and while Disney's Snow White never matches the airy, twinkling charm of the original, the same could be said of every other Disney remake.\nDisney\u2019s Snow White\nDirector: Marc Webb\nCast: Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Andrew Burnap\nRun-time: 1hr 49m\nBut then it switches back into a revolutionary drama again. Snow White bumps into Jonathan's gang of rebels, and the two of them develop a sparky Princess Leia / Han Solo dynamic as they duet on the catchiest of the film's new songs, Princess Problems. What this means is that Disney's Snow White now has not one but two merry bands of forest-dwellers. You can only assume that one draft of the screenplay had the human outlaws, and another draft had the time-honoured, cottage-sharing dwarfs, and the producers just shrugged and decided to keep both of them. This was a bizarre mistake. Why introduce seven dwarfs if they then have nothing significant to do? Why introduce a magical mine of precious stones if it's not used in the story? Webb would have been better off keeping Jonathan's gang, and cutting the dwarfs \u2013 and not just because they look so grotesque.\nThe film's split personality problems don't go away. Half of it is set in a grimy, gloomy land where Snow White wants to foment a peasants' revolt and restore a socialist utopia, but half of it is set in a chirpy, brightly-coloured fantasy realm of benign and beautiful aristocrats. Half the time, the characters are belting out overwrought, self-empowerment anthems by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the songsmiths behind The Greatest Showman. But half the time they're trilling the jaunty 1937 ditties by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey.\nPerhaps we should appreciate the value for money: the studio is in effect giving us two films for the price of one. But the producers should have picked a lane and stayed in it. As it is, Disney's Snow White keeps veering between two aesthetics and two eras, so it never picks up momentum. The story is cluttered, the tone is muddled, and the pacing is off. Again, that doesn't make the film a disaster. In some ways, the identity crisis is what makes it worth seeing. But this muddled production will be enjoyed more by politics and cinema students than by children who are hoping to be enchanted by Disney magic.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\n\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Boxing heavyweight legend George Foreman has died aged 76, according to his family. \nKnown as Big George in the ring, the American built one of the most remarkable and enduring careers in the sport, winning Olympic gold in 1968 and claiming the world heavyweight title twice, 21 years apart - the second making him the oldest champion in history aged 45.\nHe lost his first title to Muhammad Ali in their famous Rumble in the Jungle fight in 1974. But Foreman's professional boxing career boasted an astonishing total of 76 wins including 68 knockouts, almost double that of Ali. \nHe retired from the sport in 1997 but not before he agreed to put his name to a best-selling grill - a decision that went on to bring him fortunes that dwarfed his boxing earnings. \nHis family said in a post on Instagram on Friday night: \"Our hearts are broken.\n\"A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.\"\nThe statement added: \"A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family.\"\nForeman was born in Marshall, Texas, on 10 January 1949, and raised along with six siblings by a single mother in the segregated American South.\nHe dropped out of school and turned to street robberies before eventually finding his outlet in the ring.\nForeman won the heavyweight gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, aged 19, before turning pro and winning 37 consecutive matches. He lost only five bouts over his career.\nHe beat previously undefeated reigning champion Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973 knocking him down six times in the first two rounds.\nHis 1974 Rumble in the Jungle against Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, remains one of the most famous boxing matches ever. \nAli, the older man, was the underdog after he was stripped of his crown seven years earlier for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War.\nForeman reflected on the legendary fight 50 years later in an October interview with BBC World Service Newshour, explaining that everyone thought he was going to decimate Ali. \n\"Oh, he's not going to last one round,\" the boxer said experts were predicting at the time. \nForeman told the BBC he typically would get \"real nervous\" and have \"butterflies\" before any boxing match, but that night - it was the \"most comfortable\" he had felt.\nBut the wily Ali used a tactic that later became known as \"rope-a-dope\", which wore out Foreman, causing him to throw out hundreds of punches before Ali unloaded on him in the eighth round and scored a knockout.\nAfter a second professional loss, Foreman retired in 1977 and became an ordained minister at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Texas, which he founded and built.\nHe told the BBC his defeat to Ali became the \"best thing that ever happened to me\" as it ultimately led him to \"get my message out\" through preaching. \nHe recalled that his preaching started small, on street corners and with friends, then grew. \n\"We began meeting informally at various homes in Houston, and before long, the crowds became too large for most houses to accommodate,\" Foreman said on his website. \n\"Eventually, we bought a piece of land and an old, dilapidated building on the north-east side of Houston.\"\nForeman came out of retirement in 1987 to raise money for a youth centre he founded. He won 24 matches before losing to Evander Holyfield after 12 rounds in 1991.\nIn 1994, Foreman knocked out undefeated Michael Moorer to become the oldest ever heavyweight champion at age 45.\nHe became ad pitchman for his George Foreman Grill, which millions have purchased since it hit the market in 1994, thanks in part to his memorable catchphrase, the \"Lean Mean Grilling Machine\".\nForeman was married five times. He has a dozen children, including five sons who are all named George. \nHe explained on his website that he named them after himself so they \"they would always have something in common\". \n\"I say to them, 'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together,\" he explained. \"And if one goes down, we all go down together!'\"",

Heavyweight boxing legend George Foreman dies aged 76, says family 29 minutes agoShareSaveChristal HayesBBC News, Los AngelesShareSaveGetty ImagesBoxing heavyweight legend George Foreman has died aged 76, according to his family. \"I say to them, 'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together,\" he explained. He won 24 matches before losing to Evander Holyfield after 12 rounds in 1991.In 1994, Foreman knocked out undefeated Michael Moorer to become the oldest ever heavyweight champion at age 45.He became ad pitchman for his George Foreman Grill, which millions have purchased since it hit the market in 1994, thanks in part to his memorable catchphrase, the \"Lean Mean Grilling Machine\".Foreman was married five times.",

        "article_text": "Dublin's Molly Malone statue should be protected to prevent members of the public  from \"violating\" it by groping the sculpture's breasts, a campaigner has said. \nTilly Cripwell pointed out that the bronze artwork has been groped so many times over the years that its breasts have become discoloured. \nThe 23-year-old student said she has witnessed \"disgusting behaviour\" at the statue  many times while busking beside it in recent years. \nDublin City Council has said it is considering the campaigner's call to repair the discoloured statue and raise it on to a higher plinth. \nThe council also confirmed it is in the process of asking tourist companies to deter their customers from touching the statue. \nMs Cripwell said the groping of the sculpture's breasts by passers by and some tourists \"sets a really bad example to younger generations\". \n\"It triggered me so much, I just had to put a stop to it,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"The fact that this icon is immortalised in a statue but reduced to her breasts just seems so wrong.\" \nThe Molly Malone statue was erected 37 years ago in tribute to a legendary Dublin woman who sold shellfish in the streets of the Irish capital. \nIt is not clear if the character is based on a real or fictional person, but the figure of Molly Malone has come to represent part of Dublin's working class community. \nShe was also the subject of a traditional folk song, which tells the story of a fishmongers' daughter who sold cockles and mussels from a wheelbarrow.\nAccording to the colourful lyrics, Molly died of a fever but then returned as a ghost, still wheeling her wheelbarrow through the city's streets.\nMany public artworks in Dublin are popularly referred to by rhyming nicknames and for years, the Molly Malone statue was known as \"the tart with the cart\". \nThis name was in part due to suggestions that Molly Malone worked as a fishmonger by day and as a sex worker by night. \nThe statue was first erected in Dublin's Grafton Street in 1988, created by the renowned bronze sculptor, Jeanne Rynhart.\nIt was later moved to nearby St Andrews' Street to accommodate the construction of a tram line. \nMs Cripwell, who studies at Trinity College in Dublin, accepts that many people think they are doing nothing wrong because \"it's just a statue\".\nBut she said the groping annoys her because the sculpture is \"one of the few representations of women in Irish culture\".\n\"You can imagine the stag dos that come along and it's actually just disgusting behaviour, no matter what kind of object or person you're dealing with.\"\nThe statue is already on a small plinth but Ms Cripwell wants it raised higher to encourage respect and to prevent people clamouring over the statue so easily.\nShe points out that the statues of male figures in Dublin \"are all on high platforms reflecting their status\". \nThe campaigner acknowledged that she is asking for alternations to be made to an artwork that has become a Dublin landmark, but she argued change is necessary. \n\"She already been violated and that's shown in the gold discoloration on her breasts, so the original statue is not the same as it was.\"\nMs Cripwell is also lobbying for the whole sculpture to be repatinated \"so that her breasts aren't a different colour than the rest of her\". \nDublin City Council's spokeswoman told BBC News NI the request for \"repatination and securing the plinth is being considered\" and they are awaiting cost quotations.\n\"A full report will be made to the council's Strategic Policy Committee in April,\" she added. \nAn urban myth has emerged over the years which claims that touching the statue's breasts will somehow bring good luck. \nIt is a myth that has been perpetuated by some tourist companies - a practice that Ms Cripwell wants Dublin City Council to clamp down on. \nOne example of this was still visible on a Spain-based tourism website, Viabam, on Tuesday morning. \nIn a feature about the statue, the website read: \"They say that if you take a photo with her while touching her breasts, you will return to visit the city. \n\"And it seems to work, as it is one of the most sought-after and photographed monuments in Dublin.\"\nWhen contacted by BBC News NI, Viabam's spokesperson said the article was written a couple of years ago and it was \"never our intention to offend anyone\". \n\"We were totally unaware of this campaign and we have absolutely no problem in removing that information,\" they added. \nMs Cripwell said she wants tourist firms to \"actively deter\" their customers from touching the Molly Malone statue.\nBut several tourists - both male and female - were photographed by news agencies as they touched the statue during the St Patrick's Day festival on Monday. \nThe campaigner said the sculpture's \"allegedly busty dress\" was viewed as \"a green card for this behaviour\".\nShe added the practice is also popular at other European tourist sites, including at the statue of Shakespeare's Juliet in Verona.

It was like they were having a bad season,\" Kane said.\n\"People take it for granted and maybe a little bit with England as well. I've scored 69 goals and when you score against Albania or Latvia, or these teams, people just expect it so it's not spoken about so much.\n\"If I was 25 now and doing what I'm doing, the excitement around me would maybe be a little bit different to what it is now. That's part of where we are with football. I've seen it with some other players as they get into their 30s.\n\"Maybe people just get a little bit bored of what you do, but I'm certainly not bored. I'm excited for these games and the games ahead.\"\nEngland need hunger to win not fear to lose - Tuchel\n'Complicated' but 'honest' - Tuchel's path from barman to England boss\nKane has registered 21 goals in 24 Bundesliga appearances this term to help Bayern  open up a six-point advantage at the top of the table. \nThey also have a Champions League quarter-final to look forward to against Inter Milan. Yet the former Tottenham striker's impact has been questioned at times in Germany.\n\"It's hard. Sometimes it motivates me. Sometimes, to be honest I try to stay away from it as much as I can,\" Kane added.\n\"Probably, when I was young I listened to more than what I do now. Ultimately, I criticise myself more than anyone could do on the outside but... always use it as fuel to prove people wrong.\n\"In today's game, I feel like there's such a difference between a high and a low. You go from not scoring for a couple of games, to people saying he's not sharp enough... to scoring and you're a Ballon d'Or contender and it's like, the difference is too high and too low.\n\"I know what I've done in my career and I feel like I have a lot of respect from a lot of football people out there and I've achieved a lot in my career.\"\nMichael Owen was the last English player to win the Ballon d'Or in 2001. \nBut Kane believes his transfer to Bayern in 2023 has provided him with the platform to earn the coveted prize awarded to the world's best player each year.\n\"Just being at a club like Bayern Munich has helped push me on even more, confidence-wise and responsibility-wise,\" he added.\n\"I feel like I've definitely got better, I've improved, and maybe the 'aura' of me as a player is a bit more respected than what it has been in the past, because you're playing in big games, big nights.\n\"I felt that last season as well, I scored over 40 goals, but obviously, I was never going to win the Ballon d'Or because we didn't win the team trophies.\n\"Those opportunities are there. That's probably what I mean in terms of being respected more worldwide, on the bigger stage. \n\"For something like that, you have to win enough team trophies to be considered in that and probably score 40-odd goals, but that is a possibility this season.\n\"That is definitely something I would love to try to achieve.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHere's why Tuchel is the 'perfect fit' for England",

        "article_text": "It took Arun George half a working life to scrape together \u00a315,000 ($19,460) in savings, which he used to secure a care worker job for his wife in the UK.\nBut in barely a few months, he lost it all.\nMr George - not his real name as his wife doesn't want to be identified within their small community for the shame associated with having returned without a job - paid the money in late 2023 to the managers of Alchita Care. \nThe BBC has seen evidence of the payment to Alchita Care, the private domiciliary care home in Bradford that sponsored his family's visa. He did it at the behest of a local agent in his town in the southern Indian state of Kerala.\nIt was the promise of a better life for their child who has special needs that prodded the couple to dip into their savings and take such a risk. But when they got to the UK there was no work.\n\"We kept chasing the care home, but they made up excuses. After I pleaded with them, they forced us to undergo some unpaid training and gave my wife just three days of work,\" Mr George said. \"We couldn't carry on and came back to India a few months later.\"\nMr George believes he has been scammed by the company and says the ordeal has set him back at least by a decade financially. His family is just one among hundreds of people from Kerala seeking work in the UK who have been exploited by recruiters, care homes and middlemen.\nMost have now given up hope of getting justice or their money.\nAlchita Care in Bradford has not responded to the BBC's questions. Their sponsorship licence - which allows care homes to issue certificates of sponsorship to foreign care workers applying for visas - was removed by the Home Office last year.\nBut at least three other care workers who sent thousands of pounds to Alchita Care and uprooted their lives from Kerala told us that the jobs they had been promised did not materialise.\nOne of them, still in the UK, said his condition was so precarious that he was surviving on \"bread and milk\" from charity shops for the past few months.\nLike Mr George, Sridevi (not her real name) says she was charged \u00a315,000 for a visa sponsorship by Alchita Care. She spent another \u00a33,000 to get to the UK in 2023.\nShe's unable to return to India, scared of facing family members and friends from whom she took a loan to make the trip.\n\"I struggle to even pay for my rent and meals,\" she said. Her job is a far cry from the stable eight-hour work she was promised, she says. She is sometimes on call from 4am to 9pm, driving from one patient's home to another, but gets paid only for the few hours she is actually with the patient, and not the full shift.\nThousands of nurses from Kerala, desperate to migrate to the UK every year, are estimated to have been exploited after the government added care workers to the UK's shortage occupation list during Covid. This allowed people to be recruited from overseas as long as they were sponsored.\nFor many, the care worker visa was a golden ticket to a better life as they could take family along.\nBaiju Thittala, a Labour party member and the mayor of Cambridge, told the BBC he had represented at least 10 such victims over the last three years.\nBut the cross-border nature of these exploitative schemes means it has been incredibly hard to pursue justice, he said. Very often the victims have made payments to care homes or middlemen domiciled outside India which leads to \"jurisdiction problems\", he added.\nSecondly, lawyers are expensive and most care workers, already in deep debt, can hardly afford to fight it out in the courts.\nThittala estimates at least 1,000-2,000 people from Kerala, directly or indirectly victims of these schemes, are still in the UK.\nThere are also hundreds of people scattered across Kerala's towns who lost money before they could even leave home.\nIn the town of Kothamangalam, the BBC spoke to some 30 people who had collectively lost millions of dollars while trying to obtain a care visa that allows professionals to come to - or stay - in the UK to work in the social care sector.\nAll of them accused one agent - Henry Poulos and his agency Grace International in the UK and India - of robbing them of their life savings through fake job offers and sponsorship letters.\nMr Poulos even made some of them take a 2,500km journey to Delhi for visa appointments that were non-existent, they said.\nShilpa, who lives in the town of Alleppey, told the BBC she had taken out a bank loan at a 13% interest rate to pay Mr Poulos, who gave her a fake certificate of sponsorship.\n\"I thought the UK would offer a good future for my three daughters, but now I am struggling to pay their school fees,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I have lost everything. My wife had left her job in Israel so that we could move to the UK,\" said another victim, Binu, breaking down. He made a comfortable \u00a31,500 with his wife in Israel but has now been forced to take his children out of private school in Kerala because there's no money anymore.\nNeither Mr Poulos nor Grace International responded to the BBC, despite repeated attempts to get in touch with them. The police in Kothamangalam said Mr Poulos was absconding in the UK, and they had sealed his local offices after receiving complaints from six people.\nThe previous Conservative government in the UK admitted last year that there was \"clear evidence\" that care workers were being offered visas under false pretences and paid far below the minimum wage required for their work.\nRules to reduce its misuse were tightened in 2024, including increasing the minimum salary.

Their sponsorship licence - which allows care homes to issue certificates of sponsorship to foreign care workers applying for visas - was removed by the Home Office last year.But at least three other care workers who sent thousands of pounds to Alchita Care and uprooted their lives from Kerala told us that the jobs they had been promised did not materialise.Vishnu VardhanFor many Indians, the care worker visa was a golden ticket to a better life as they could take family alongOne of them, still in the UK, said his condition was so precarious that he was surviving on \"bread and milk\" from charity shops for the past few months.Like Mr George, Sridevi (not her real name) says she was charged \u00a315,000 for a visa sponsorship by Alchita Care.

        "article_text": "\"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y.\nBen is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.\n\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"\nBen is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.\nMusk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nFor some who do not share his views, it has all become too much. \nThere have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal. \nAlthough most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.\nIn the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.\nUS President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".\nMusk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\nWhat is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers. \nAnd if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?\nTwo decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.\nMusk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.\n\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"\nIt is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.\nNowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.\nLike the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.\nBut recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.\nAlthough its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.\nThe decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.\nThis year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia. \nMeanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.\nIn early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.\nSales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y \u2013 with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.\nIn the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"\nTesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.\nBut experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.\nTo start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.\n\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"\nProf Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"\nCompetition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.\nAt the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.\n\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.\n\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"\nThe extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.\nMusk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.\nIn January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.\nIn 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.\n\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.\nArguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.\nAsked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".\n\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.\n\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"\nEver since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.\nThat is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.\nFor those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.\nToday, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.\n\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.\nNone of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.\nBut analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.\n\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"\n\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.\n\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Debra Eichenbaum had not thought about the measles virus for 20 years when she got her two young children vaccinated against the highly contagious disease.\nBut then cases across the US began to climb this year, and the 62-year-old worried about how best to protect her husband, David, who is immunocompromised after surviving pancreatic cancer.\nSo she got another measles shot, and emailed friends her age, encouraging them to check with their doctors to make sure they were still immunised.\n\"There's no downside to it,\" she said. \"For me, that was a no-brainer.\"\nMs Eichenbaum is just one adult who debated an extra shot when cases spiked across the US. Others are thinking about their children, who may not yet have been immunised against the virus.\n\"There is a lot of confusion out there right now, especially in light of differences in how different age groups of the population have been vaccinated based on what the recommendations were at the time of their vaccination,\" said Donald Dumford III, an infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic.\nThe US declared it had eliminated measles from the country in 2000, after decades of access to a safe and effective vaccine. But since the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase in vaccine scepticism, the number of measles outbreaks has risen.\nThere have been over 300 cases in 2025 across more than a dozen states. This year, the US saw the first measles death in a decade: a 6-year-old girl in western Texas, the epicentre of an outbreak that has spread to neighbouring New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nMeasles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly. \nVaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases that exists, spreading very easily if people are unprotected, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nHealth Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine-sceptic, has sent mixed messages about the outbreak, at times encouraging people to talk to their doctor about vaccines, and at other moments, promoting alternative treatments not recommended by public health experts.\nThe federal government has not offered any guidance about whether certain adults should talk to their doctor about getting another shot - or whether parents in hotspots should consider getting their young children vaccinated sooner.\nAsked for comment, the US Department of Health and Human Services referred the BBC to existing measles vaccine guidance from the CDC.\nMs Eichenbaum decided on another measles vaccine over concerns that some people vaccinated in the 1960s may have received a less effective dose. \nThose vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 may have received what is known as an inactivated measles vaccine, and should consider getting an additional shot, said Melissa Stockwell, a professor of paediatrics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\nThose who are unsure about their vaccination status can either search for their written vaccination records or have their antibody levels checked with a blood test, doctors say.\nAdults born earlier than 1957 likely had measles as a child and are considered immune, Dr Stockwell said.\n\"The recommendation is that anyone who does not have presumptive immunity should be vaccinated,\" she said.\nFor weeks before his new baby was born, Kyle Rable and his pregnant wife exchanged anxious messages throughout the day, wondering how they could best keep their future son safe from measles.\n\"It's basically both of our constant thoughts all the time,\" said Mr Rable, whose wife gave birth to their son, Steven, earlier this month in the same hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where a child died of measles just a week before.\nThe outbreak in western Texas has raised the alarm for parents across the state and in the wider region, especially those who have young babies who cannot yet be immunised.\nThe measles vaccine is not generally recommended for children who are under a year old because the shots do not work as well before that age, doctors say. \nIt is a two-dose vaccine. Typically, children are given their first shot between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and then another between ages 4 and 6.\nBut for young children who live near a measles outbreak, paediatricians may recommend a shot at an earlier age, between six and 11 months, said Stuart Ray, professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nMr Rable plans to ask about vaccination plans at his son's two-week checkup, and will \"100%\" vaccinate his child early if the doctor recommends it.\nChildren vaccinated before they are a year old still need two additional standard doses of the measles vaccine later on, Dr Ray said.\n\"There's no harm in getting the additional doses,\" said Tony Moody, a paediatrics professor at Duke University School of Medicine. \"The decision about getting an early MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) should be a conversation between the family and their paediatrician.\"\nChildren can get a second dose as soon as 28 days after their first shot.\n\"The vaccine starts providing some protection within weeks of the first dose,\" Dr Ray said.\nParents hoping to get their children vaccinated against measles, or adults looking for another dose, can make an appointment at a pharmacy. \nHowever, some pharmacies - especially in Texas, the epicentre of the outbreak - have seen vaccine shortages because of higher demand.  \nThe CDC has provided thousands of doses to the state. \nLocal health departments in western Texas also are holding vaccination clinics, while many across the US offer the shot free of charge.

        "article_text": "The iconic 90s hip-hop artist was known for his pained intensity. But Dear Mama, a tribute to his mother Afeni, showed off his softer side \u2013 and still brings listeners to tears.\n\"Not everyone is so lucky and gets to experience the love of a mother for a long time,\" explains DJ Master Tee, whose words are staggered due to deep emotion, before he starts to cry down the phone.\u00a0\n\"A lot of people's mothers died way too early\u2026 and I think Tupac Shakur understood that well,\" the producer continues. \"He didn't just want to make a song that celebrated the mothers who are here, but also the ones that passed away.\"\nDJ Master Tee made the original silky-smooth beat (which was later adapted by co-producer Tony Pizarro) for Dear Mama, the late rap legend Tupac's candid tribute to the many sacrifices of his single mother Afeni Shakur. She was an activist in the radical political group The Black Panthers, who subsequently struggled with drug addiction and to make ends meet while raising her two children.\nThis song is the pained yet ultimately joyful epicentre of Tupac's otherwise death-obsessed third studio album, Me Against the World, which was released 30 years ago this month. In the context of an album where Tupac shifts from suicidal (So Many Tears) to grief-stricken (Lord Knows), repeatedly using the word \"hopeless\", Dear Mama feels like uncovering a diamond at the bottom of a pitch-black mine.\n\"Even as a crack phene, momma / You always were a black queen, momma,\" he famously rapped.\nThis lyric alone represented a radical shift in rap storytelling in the way it represented victims of the so-called Crack Era, when use of the drug soared across the US during the 1980s and 90s.\nPreviously, rap artists had stripped away the humanity of crack addicts via slurs such as \"basehead\" and \"zombie\". But, Tee says, Tupac saw addicts \"as victims of the state, who needed our support\". And although Tupac expresses sadness over a childhood with little money \u2013 where he and his sister Sekyiwa observed the matriarch of their family descend into the hell of addiction \u2013 he leads with empathy for Afeni Shakur's struggle.\nHe chants out all his words with a bear-hug warmth, confirming that he never stopped seeing Afeni as a superhero. In celebrating her, Tupac serves to pay respect to the struggle of single mothers everywhere, as well as mothers full stop \u2013 a sentiment the whole world can appreciate. This is reflected in the numbers, with the song racking up over 345 million streams on Spotify alone. Indeed, Dear Mama remains one of the rapper's most celebrated tracks: in 2009, it became the first song by a solo rapper to be inducted into the US Library of Congress's National Recording Registry, awarded for its profound cultural significance.\n\"It really doesn't matter if you grew up in the ghetto or not, because Dear Mama transcends all of that,\" explains the song's engineer, Paul Arnold. \"You could be rich, poor, black, white, brown, whatever; you'll find a way to relate to the song.\u00a0Honestly, it's difficult for me to even talk about it and not get choked up. It forces you to think about your own mother and that isn't always easy. Behind all the controversy, it was obvious he was a very emotional guy.\"\u00a0\nTo properly explore the creation of this song, you must follow the roots of the woman who inspired it. Born in North Carolina in 1947, Afeni Shakur (whose birth name was Alice Faye Williams) was confronted with racism from the start. This was a time where Jim Crow laws around racial segregation were bluntly enforced.\nAfeni's family moved to the Bronx when she was 11. Despite living in the diverse melting pot of New York City, she felt she was part of a system designed to push black people to the bottom of US society. She found solace hanging around local street gangs (including the Gangster Disciples) and subscribed to the \"by any means necessary\" approach of activist Malcolm X, who preached that black Americans should violently resist their oppressors in sharp contrast to Martin Luther King's celebrated pacifism. After seeing the co-founder of the Black Panther party Bobby Seale speak at a political rally in 1968, Afeni was inspired enough to join, telling The New York Times in 1970 she was impressed by the way he spoke of the homeless leading their revolution: \"I'd never seen that before.\"\nAfeni quickly rose through the ranks of the Black Panthers, pioneering a free breakfast plan for hungry schoolchildren and starting a protest campaign against exploitative landlords. The party won high-profile enemies including FBI director J Edgar Hoover, who ran surveillance on key members (resulting in the 1969 assassination of radical deputy chairman Fred Hampton) and considered the group a threat to the status-quo. In 1971, Afeni was one of 21 Black Panther members indicted by a New York grand jury, accused of plotting to shoot police officers.\nFrom prison Afeni maintained a position of strength, writing in one unapologetic letter to the media: \"We know that we live in a world inhuman in its poverty. We know that we are a colony, living under community imperialism. The US that we see is not one of freedom, beauty, and wisdom, but of fear, terror, and hate. We have no respect for your laws, taxes, your gratitude, sincerity, honour and dignity. You don't respect us \u2013 thus we don't respect YOU.\" This defiance and righteous anger would be something her future son would directly channel into his rap career.\u00a0\nHeavily pregnant and facing a 300-year prison sentence, Afeni refused legal counsel, choosing to represent herself in what was then the most expensive trial in the history of New York State. Despite the bleak odds, she won her freedom and was the driving force behind the Panthers being acquitted on all 156 counts. Born a month after the trial ended, her son Tupac Amaru was named after the Peruvian warrior who led the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Spanish American History. Right from his birth on 16 June 1971, Afeni's boy had revolution and black nationalism pulsing through his veins.\nGrowing up in East Harlem, Tupac was often surrounded by enemies of the state. His stepfather Mutulu Shakur and step-aunt Assata Shakur were political rebels on the FBI's Most Wanted List. A paranoid Afeni also taught her son how to spot undercover federal agents lurking outside their apartment building by observing their shaky body language and suspect sunglasses. If Tupac ever misbehaved, he would be punished by being forced to read The New York Times cover-to-cover.\u00a0\nHis knowledge of global politics was at an advanced level long before his 10th birthday, and while the other kids read comic books, Tupac was learning how fear is more powerful than respect through reading Machiavelli's The Prince. He also admired how his mother, to quote lyrics from Dear Mama, \"made miracles every Thanksgiving\" \u2013 cooking a wholesome meal despite working multiple jobs and living off welfare food stamps.\nAfeni had on-off partners who served as role models to Tupac, but he never really had a stable father figure in his life, with biological dad (and fellow Black Panther) Billy Garland largely absent until later years. When the Black Panthers disbanded, Afeni, like so many of her peers, struggled to readjust to mainstream society. Years of being accosted by police led to her suffering PTSD, and during a choppy childhood living in New York, Baltimore, and Marin City, California, Tupac watched his mother's sharp decline. She increasingly self-medicated with drugs to alleviate her pain.\nA talented actor who could quote Shakespeare at will, Tupac secured a place at the coveted Baltimore School of the Arts. It helped push him away from trouble and family drama. But when the family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area due to financial problems, Tupac's academic hopes dissolved into the ether.\u00a0Converting the poetry he wrote to process childhood trauma into chart-topping raps became Tupac's main focus; he saw himself as that rare rose which could grow through the harshness of the inner-city concrete.\nFormer DJ Billy Dee first met Tupac early on in his rap career, back when he was a member of the funk hip-hop collective the Digital Underground. They bonded during a 1989 tour that brought the group over to Berlin, where Dee's family was also based.\u00a0\"He hated the German food and the big sausages,\" she recalls. \"I invited him back to my mom's house and she cooked him fried chicken. My mom was a single mother and I remember he liked that about her a lot.\"\nShe continues: \"If you were with him, he would literally die to protect you. But he was so radically smart, too. My mom had photos with Yasser Arafat on the wall. Tupac, even as a young man, knew exactly who that was and spoke passionately during our lunch about supporting the historical struggle of the Palestinian state.\"\nA student of political emcees like Chuck D and Ice Cube, Tupac had similarly socially conscious lyrics, which passionately furthered Bobby Seale's dream of a black community where should someone fall down, everyone else served as their crutches. He quickly was signed to Interscope Records and, on Tupac's stirring 1991 debut album 2Pacalypse Now, the gut punch of a rap fable Brenda's Got a Baby told the story of a teenage black girl who faces horrific neglect and abuse. It's Dickensian in its three-dimensional dissection of society's most forgotten casualties.\u00a0\nYet the rising artist was also a magnet for controversy, and many couldn't get past the palpable contradictions in his music. For every bluesy song that advocated women having full autonomy over their bodies (Keep Ya Head Up) or preached unity within gang neighbourhoods, there were more nihilistic street anthems where Tupac referred to women using offensive slurs and glorified shooting crooked cops. It was unclear whether he wanted to lead the revolution or simply press the self-destruct button.\u00a0\nFrom firing at two off-duty police officers harassing a black motorist (the charges were later dropped) in Atlanta, to being convicted for assaulting film director Allen Hughes, a fatalistic Tupac was often in the newspapers more for controversy than actual music. Going into the creation of his third solo album, Me Against the World, the artist desperately needed a song that showed a softer side.\u00a0\nDJ Master Tee remembers the night he gave Tupac the beat to Dear Mama well. After Tupac had just come off stage doing a landmark freestyle at New York's Madison Square Garden alongside then-friend and fellow rapper The Notorious B.I.G. Backstage, Tee gave the rapper a cassette filled with beats. It didn't take long until Tupac called him up, excited about one particular instrumental that was built around an interpretation of jazz keyboardist Joe Sample's soothing In All My Wildest Dreams.\nMaster Tee had flipped this song's lovelorn, slowly caressed keys by matching them with raw vinyl scratches. Tee knew his use of this sample would trigger something deep within Tupac and he likens its tone to a sunny afternoon spent reminiscing over family photos. On the original version, which was recorded in October 1993, Tupac opens by saying: \"Yo, Master Tee, drop something for my momma!\" Tee says the words flowed out of Tupac with \"real ease\" in the studio.\nIn a 1995 interview with the LA Times, Tupac said he had wanted to make the rap equivalent of Don McLean's Vincent. \"So it came out like this deep love ballad,\" Tee says. \"He was a machine with it! He would do a full song with three or four verses as well as a bridge and hook in one take, and it would sound perfect. I also worked with Prince and Tupac reminded me of him. They were both workaholics, who you never saw yawn once. There was a mission behind the music!\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Kendrick Lamar's road to the Superbowl\n\u2022\u00a0The provocative 80s rap that became an anthem\n\u2022\u00a0The party that started hip-hop\nIn 2023, Master Tee, aka Terrence Thomas, filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against parties including Tupac's record label Interscope and its parent company\u00a0Universal Music Group claiming he was \"never properly and fully credited with his publishing copyright from the writing and creation of the music of Dear Mama\". Last year, it was reported, Universal Music began the process of seeking the claim's dismissal.\nEngineer Paul Arnold, alongside the producer Tony Pizarro, was later asked by the label to make the song more timeless and radio-friendly. Although they kept the beat's foundational sample, they added\u00a0more instrumental layers as well as a syrupy R&B hook that interpreted the song Sadie by Motown group The Spinners. \"They didn't like what we turned in at first,\" recalls Arnold. \"But we persuaded them to live with it overnight. The next day we got a call like: 'Don't touch it!'\"\nArnold met Tupac a few times in New York's Quad Studios and was impressed by the way he took time to speak to everybody and hear out their life story. \"He'd be interested enough to listen to the life story of the guy bringing in the coffee,\" Arnold says.\nTupac tended to stack his vocals, recording three or four separate versions of the same verse, combining the various voices so his presence was more commanding and carried an eerie pull. It resulted in a voice that was gigantic and filled with duelling layers of pain; the raps were bellowed out like an ancient mountain-top God shouting down prophecies to his followers. However, Dear Mama was the rare track where Tupac had insisted on only one vocal track.\u00a0\n\"One of the reasons his voice sounds softer than usual on Dear Mama is because we pulled back on the vocal layering,\" Arnold explains. \"We wanted Tupac's voice to have more of a direct feel, so it's like a one-on-one conversation.\"\u00a0\nTupac, who raps: \"I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man,\" recognised that it was single mothers who shouldered the extra burdens working class boys racked up during their transition into men. He also pleaded for troubled young black males to forgive their mothers for any hardships, finding a way to exchange grudges for love and deep-rooted appreciation.\u00a0\n\"Dear Mama proved that even the biggest gangsta rapper in America with Thug Life tattooed on his chest could still be super vulnerable,\" says Arnold, who believes the fact Tupac's vocals sound on the edge of tears remains the song's biggest strength. \"He really was more like a preacher than a rapper. He knew crying made you more of a man. I got to meet Afeni, when I worked on posthumous Tupac music later on. When we met, she gave me the biggest hug. All the love that's inside Dear Mama made more sense to me after that.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe purgative Dear Mama was a big hit, reaching the peak of the Billboard Rap Songs chart, just as the album went to number one too; it was accompanied by a music video, featuring Afeni beaming with pride while looking through old photos of her son. It's still part of the cultural conversation years later: in 2023, FX released a TV docu-series bearing the song's name and focusing on Afeni and Tupac's rollercoaster relationship. At the time of Dear Mama's release in 1995, Tupac was imprisoned on sexual assault charges, which he always vigorously denied, and still nursing five bullet wounds sustained in an ambush while visiting the same studio where he'd laid down Dear Mama vocals. The world didn't know whether to see him as a pariah or an outlaw.\u00a0\u00a0\nA lot has been made of the period that followed its release: Tupac was eventually bailed out of prison by the notorious Death Row Records's CEO Suge Knight pending an appeal of his conviction, and his music took a more war-ready stance, culminating in his murder in a drive-by shooting on 7 September 1996 in Las Vegas. Yet for DJ Master Tee, it's Dear Mama that best represents Tupac's humanity. \"It's a really simple song and it's very catchy, but this allowed it to resonate with more people,\" he says. \"It's a song that will outlive us all. Whenever the grieving press play on Dear Mama, they'll instantly be able to recall what a mother's embrace feels like.\"\nThis tribute to the dead was confirmed by a live performance of Dear Mama at a 1996 Mother's Day charity benefit organised by Death Row Records for single mothers. The rapper explained to the cheering crowd: \"[With this song] I want to talk about the people who don't got mommas anymore. We sometimes forget to appreciate our mothers! But my little homie Mutah [Beale, who was a member of Tupac's Outlaw Immortalz collective and, as a toddler, watched his parents get murdered in the family living room] hasn't got no mother today. He can't share in our smiles.\"\nIt all goes back to something Tupac says on the song's third verse: \"And there's no way I can pay you back / But my plan is to show you that I understand.\" This proves Dear Mama isn't just a song, but more a ritual; a sonic safe space for the listener to sit still and reminisce on their mother's sacrifices. As Arnold concludes: \"Tupac immortalises a mother's love and their willingness to do whatever it takes to ensure their child is doing alright. That will always be powerful, no matter who you are.\"\nThe FX docuseries Dear Mama is available to watch on Disney+\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Film and high-end TV production spend in the UK was \u00a35.6bn last year - and the biggest film was Wicked, made at Sky Studios Elstree in Hertfordshire.\nThe managing director of the studios, Noel Tovey, says it has been \"a bit of a rollercoaster\" with back-to-back films made here since it opened in February 2023 - the latest facility in the rapid studio expansion around London.\nTovey says the film industry has had challenges, among them Hollywood industrial action and budget cuts to streaming services, but there's been a \"slow recovery through 2024\".\nIn terms of how the industry is benefiting the local area, Sky says payroll postcodes on recent productions demonstrate that about a quarter of the production crews live within a 10-mile radius of Sky Studios Elstree.\nUnderneath the gleaming silver arch and around the freshly landscaped courtyard,  there is industrious activity inside the studios.\nThe production bell signalling the start and end of takes rings out repeatedly. Crew members drift out of the sound stages, wearing overalls or hi-vis tabards. There has been constant film production here since the studios opened in February 2023, with the cameras rolling on Wicked before the building was even complete.\nThe noise of the mini-forklift trucks and golf buggies moving busily around the site is completely silenced as the doors shut on the 25,000sq ft (2,320sq m) Sound Stage 2.\nThe scene in Wicked for the song Dancing Through Life, with its spinning library and flying books, was filmed here.\n\"Every costume and every film set, all the props, all the special effects rigs, everything was made here in the studio,\" Tovey tells BBC London.\n\"To see the finished result on the big screen, and for it to win awards, has been the icing on the cake.\"\nWicked, which had the biggest cinema opening for a musical adaptation of a stage show, won two Academy Awards at this year's Oscars, including for Best Production Design, accepted by Londoner Nathan Crowley - plaudits that emphasise the quality of the crews working in film around London.\n\"A mile down the road is Elstree Studios; it's celebrating its 100th year this year and that just shows there are generations of crew that have grown up in this area,\" Tovey says.\nTax breaks make the Home Counties an attractive place to make film and high-end TV but there are other elements that have to come together, Tovey says.\n\"Being in the right place is crucial - for the crew base, for the supply chain, for easy access to central London and transport links - but also to have the room to build a facility of this scale.\"\nDespite the optimistic message coming from Sky Studios Elstree, it has been a punishing few years for the industry.\nThe post-Covid spending spree in high-end TV stalled - shows made in the UK saw a \u00a3598m spend last year, 22% down on 2023 - as streaming platforms cut back their budgets, while UK box office takings are still 22% below their 2019 level.\nIn 2023, the industrial action by writers in the US had some impact in the UK. Production on Wicked was halted 10 days before filming was complete. For freelancers that make up the majority of the workforce, there is significant job insecurity.\nBut that doesn't stop young people in Borehamwood wanting to get into the industry.\nEve Byrne is on a 12-month paid traineeship at Sky Studios Elstree. \"I think for so many people it feels like something really cool that you'd love to do but you have no clue how you'd actually get there yourself,\" she says.\nThe Future Talent Programme is in its third year and of the 32 trainees taken on so far, a large proportion live locally - and 70% have gone on to work in the industry.\nIshani Mistry is an alumna. \"I was lucky enough to be a runner on set [on Wicked] so I got to see Cynthia [Erivo] singing Defying Gravity whilst being harnessed in this contraption that was flipping her upside down and doing a loop-the-loop in the air on the broomstick,\" she says.\nSky Studios Elstree is hoping that the sequel, Wicked: For Good, which is due to be released in November, will contribute to the continuing recovery of the UK film industry.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

There has been constant film production here since the studios opened in February 2023, with the cameras rolling on Wicked before the building was even complete.The noise of the mini-forklift trucks and golf buggies moving busily around the site is completely silenced as the doors shut on the 25,000sq ft (2,320sq m) Sound Stage 2.The scene in Wicked for the song Dancing Through Life, with its spinning library and flying books, was filmed here.Sky Studios ElstreeSky Studios Elstree was opened in February 2023 and has 12 sound stagesSky Studios ElstreeInside the Sound Stage 2 at Sky Studios Elstree\"Every costume and every film set, all the props, all the special effects rigs, everything was made here in the studio,\" Tovey tells BBC London. \"A mile down the road is Elstree Studios; it's celebrating its 100th year this year and that just shows there are generations of crew that have grown up in this area,\" Tovey says.Universal Pictures/Sky Studios ElstreeCast and crew on the Wicked setTax breaks make the Home Counties an attractive place to make film and high-end TV but there are other elements that have to come together, Tovey says. \"I was lucky enough to be a runner on set [on Wicked] so I got to see Cynthia [Erivo] singing Defying Gravity whilst being harnessed in this contraption that was flipping her upside down and doing a loop-the-loop in the air on the broomstick,\" she says.Sky Studios Elstree is hoping that the sequel, Wicked: For Good, which is due to be released in November, will contribute to the continuing recovery of the UK film industry.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Nienke Panis-Ringersma has made a career out of following the region's famous blooms. Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.\nFew images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands \u2013 the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom \u2013 venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek \"Bulb Region\", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.\nThe SpeciaList\nNienke Panis-Ringersma is the owner of the photography and Dutch culture blog Tulips in Holland, which now also shares its tulip photos and weekly flower updates via X, Instagram and most recently TikTok. She is a licensed national tour guide, and her husband says she eats, sleeps and dreams tulips.\nWe spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. \"People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. \"They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.\"\nNonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower \u2013 enough to have made it her career. \"I think it's the excitement,\" she says. \"It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.\"\u00a0\nHere are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.\n1. Best overall: Keukenhof\n\"So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,\" says Panis-Ringersma.\nEstablished in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped \"inspirational\" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. \"Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. \"It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.\"\n\u00a0\nResponsible Flower Viewing\nTourists, take note; in the Netherlands, it's illegal to park near or walk through tulip fields. \"Flower fields are commercial fields,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can damage crops by entering with your normal shoes, when you bring in bacteria, especially the hyacinths are very sensitive to that. And you don't want to have people over in the fields taking photos, picking flowers over there. Some tourists think that the fields are for there for them.\"\nVisitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic \"whisper boat\" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). \"The best time to go is the $1m question,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's different every year\u2026 right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.\"\nWebsite: https://keukenhof.nl/en/\nAddress: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse\nContact: info@keukenhof.nl\nInstagram: @visitkeukenhof\n2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade\nTo truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.\u00a0\n\"A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment\u2026 every town is a very festive atmosphere.\"\nInsider Bloemencorso Flower Parade tip\nPanis-Ringersma encourages visitors to also catch the events surrounding parade day. \"Not many people know that there's the Night Parade on Friday evening,\" she says. \"It's in Noordwijkerhout, a very small town. People gather there to look at the parade floats, have a drink and have something to eat outside on the terrace.\" During the Night Parade, the floats are illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere.\nAnd on float Construction Days (Wednesday to Friday), spectators can watch volunteers decorate the floats with thousands of flowers. On Sunday afternoon, after the parade, the floats are displayed for one last time in the city of Haarlem.\nThe Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. \"It's a full day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure\u2026 it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.\"\nPanis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. \"Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,\" she says. \"But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.\"\nWhile waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. \"It's a very festive day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"Every town is having markets \u2026 it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.\"\nWebsite: https://bloemencorso-bollenstreek.nl/en/\nPhone: +31 (0)252 428 237\nInstagram: @bloemencorsobollenstreek\n3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm\nFor those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. \"Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,\" she says. \"So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!\"\nPanis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. \"All three are founded by bulb growers,\" she says. \"So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.\"\nThe family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. \"You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience.\" What sort of tulip products? \"Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,\" she says. \"If you can name it, everything with tulips.\"\nAlternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. \"They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"So, for a bit younger target audience.\"\nHeading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. \"You can go together with the bulb grower,\" she says. \"You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.\"\nWebsite: https://tulipexperienceamsterdam.nl\nAddress: Delfweg 37, 2211 VK Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands\nPhone: +31651368784\nInstagram: @tulipexperienceamsterdam\n4. Best for kids: Tulip picking\nFor visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. \"Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'\" she says. \"No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.\"\nTulip Road Trip Map\nWhen roaming the Bollenstreek, it's helpful to have a plan \u2013 like Panis-Ringersma's helpful tulip road trip map; perfect for navigating the area by car or by bike.\n\"The green map square is Keukenhof,\" she explains. \"All the yellow stars are flower fields. The pink line is a long route among various flower fields; the blue is a route towards the beach. And when you drive by bike or by car, you will absolutely find tulip fields in bloom regardless the time of season during springtime.\"\nThere are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. \"Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',\" explains Panis-Ringersma. \"Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.\"\nWebsite: https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl\nAddress: Haarlemmerstraat 15A, 2182 HA Hillegom, Netherlands\nPhone: +31653839979\nInstagram: @pickinggardenholland\n5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum\nFor Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.\nDid You Know?\n\"An interesting fact about tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's not native to the Netherlands but people think it is.\" Tulips are, in fact, native to the Himalayas, where they flourished as a small red mountain flower before being brought to Turkey in the 1400s. \"People from Turkey went to the Himalayas and took this magical flower,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They thought, 'Oh, it's very interesting. Let's see if we can make it taller or different colours.' At the end of the 16th Century, it came to the Netherlands. People would have thought, 'Okay, it's a very ugly bulb, but there comes a beautiful flower out of it.'\"\n\"It's like a living museum,\" she says. \"Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.\"\nThe Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.\n\"So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.\"\nWebsite: https://hortus-bulborum.nl/en/\nAddress: Zuidkerkenlaan 23A, 1906 AC Limmen, Netherlands\nPhone: +31617291643\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hortusbulborum/\n\u00a0\nThis article was originally published 31 March 2024 and has been updated to reflect the 2025 opening and closing dates for Keukenhof Gardens.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife and Travel, delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Travel, head over to our Facebook page or message us on X.",

Instead, it said the protests were led by local indigenous leaders who were opposed to the pipeline.\nThe nine-person jury reached a verdict on Wednesday after about two days of deliberating. \nThe case was heard at a court in Mandan, about 100 miles (160km) north of where the protests took place.\nTrey Cox, a lawyer for Energy Transfer, said during closing arguments that Greenpeace's actions caused between $265m to $340m in damages. He asked the jury to award the company that amount, plus additional damages. \nConstruction of the Dakota Access Pipeline gained international attention during President Donald Trump's first term, as Native American groups set up an encampment trying to block it from passing near Standing Rock.\nThe protests, which saw acts of violence and vandalism, started in April 2016 and ended in February 2017, when the National Guard and police cleared away the demonstrators. \nAt the peak, over 10,000 protesters were on site. The group included more than 200 Native American tribes, hundreds of US military veterans, actors and political leaders - including current US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr.\nThe 1,172-mile pipeline has been operating since 2017. However, it still lacks a key permit to operate under Lake Oahe in South Dakota, and local tribes have pushed for an extensive environmental review of the project. \nDuring the three-week trial, jurors heard from Energy Transfer's co-founder and board chairman Kelcy Warren, who said in a video deposition that protesters had created \"a total false narrative\" about his company.\n\"It was time to fight back,\" he said.\nEnergy Transfer's lawyer Mr Cox told the court that Greenpeace had exploited the Dakota Access Pipeline to \"promote its own selfish agenda\".\nAttorneys for Greenpeace argued that the group did not lead the protests, but merely helped support \"nonviolent, direct-action training\".\nIn response to the verdict, Greenpeace International's general counsel Kristin Casper said \"Energy Transfer hasn't heard the last of us in this fight\".\n\"We will not back down, we will not be silenced,\" she said. \nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said he believes \"the verdict's magnitude will have a chilling effect on environmental and other public interest litigation\". \n\"It may encourage litigants in other states to file similar lawsuits,\" he told the BBC. \nEnergy Transfer's legal action named Greenpeace USA, as well as its Washington DC-based funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc and its Amsterdam-based parent group Greenpeace International.\nGreenpeace has counter-sued Energy Transfer in Dutch court, claiming the oil firm is attempting to unfairly use the legal system to silence critics.\nThe lawsuit, filed earlier this month, seeks to recover all damages and costs.",

        "article_text": "Indonesia's parliament has passed controversial changes to legislation that will allow its military a bigger role in government.\nCritics warn that the move could return Indonesia to the dark days of Suharto's military dictatorship, which lasted 32 years until he was forced out of office in 1998.\nThe revisions backed by President Prabowo Subianto - a former special forces commander and Suharto's son-in-law - allow military officers to take up positions in government without first retiring or resigning from the armed forces.\nHundreds of pro-democracy activists have camped outside parliament since Wednesday evening to protest at the changes.\n\"The essence of democracy is that the military should not engage in politics. The military should only manage barracks and national defence,\" said Wilson, an activist with the Indonesian Association of Families of the Disappeared (KontraS), a group advocating for activists who disappeared during a crackdown in 1997 and 1998.\n\"Since 1998, there has been a creeping murder of democracy. And today marks its peak. Democracy has been killed by the House of Representatives,\" Wilson told the BBC. \nThe revisions allow active military personnel to hold positions in 14 civilian institutions, up from 10. They also raise retirement age by several years for most ranks. Highest-ranking four-star generals can now serve until 63, up from 60. \nBy Thursday evening, the crowd of protesters outside parliament had grown to nearly a thousand. \"Return the military to the barracks!\" \"Against militarism and oligarchy,\" read the banners they held.\nPolice officers and military personnel stood guard around the protesters. \nWhile there have been efforts over the past 25 years to limit the military's involvement in politics and governance, local human rights watchdog Imparsial found that nearly 2,600 active-duty officers were serving in civilian roles even before the law's revision.\nThe changes signal a \"broader consolidation of power\" under Prabowo, said Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel. \nThat the main opposition party endorsed the changes - despite initial opposition - further underscores this shift, he noted. \n\"By embedding military perspectives into civilian domains, the legislation could reshape Indonesia's policy direction, potentially prioritising stability and state control over democratic governance and civil liberties,\" Mr Dinarto said. \nThe armed forces' \"dual function\", where they are given control of security and administrative affairs, was central to Suharto's regime.\nFor some Indonesians, Prabowo epitomises that authoritarian era. It was he who led the special forces unit accused of abducting activists in 1997 and 1998.\nMany had feared that his return to political power and becoming president would erode Indonesia's hard-won but fragile democracy.\nSince taking office last October, Prabowo has already been expanding the military's involvement in public areas. His flagship $4bn free-meal programme for children and pregnant women, for instance, receives logistical support from the armed forces.\nDefending the amendments on Thursday, defence minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told parliament \"geopolitical changes and global military technology\" require the military to transform to tackle \"conventional and non conventional conflicts\". \n\"We will never disappoint the Indonesians in keeping our sovereignty,\" he said. \nHowever some rights groups argue that increasing military control in public affairs beyond defence will undermine impartiality. \n\"How can active-duty officers in the Attorney General's Office remain impartial when they are still bound by military command?\" asked Virdika Rizky Utama, a researcher at Jakarta-based think-tank PARA Syndicate, Benar News reports. \n\"If the military gains influence over the justice system, who will hold them accountable?\" \n\"President Prabowo appears intent on restoring the Indonesian military's role in civilian affairs, which were long characterised by widespread abuses and impunity,\" said Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch. \n\"The government's rush to adopt these amendments undercuts its expressed commitment to human rights and accountability.\" \nKontraS also noted that the government's \"rush to amend the [law] stands in stark contrast to its prolonged inaction on other critical human rights commitments\".\n\"This long struggle cannot stop just because the law has been passed. There is only one word: Resist,\" said Sukma Ayu, an undergraduate at Universitas Muhammadiyah Prof. Hamka in Jakarta. \n\"We will continue protesting until we claim victory... We have no choice but to occupy the 'house of the people',\" she said. ",

        "article_text": "Nienke Panis-Ringersma has made a career out of following the region's famous blooms. Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.\nFew images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands \u2013 the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom \u2013 venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek \"Bulb Region\", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.\nThe SpeciaList\nNienke Panis-Ringersma is the owner of the photography and Dutch culture blog Tulips in Holland, which now also shares its tulip photos and weekly flower updates via X, Instagram and most recently TikTok. She is a licensed national tour guide, and her husband says she eats, sleeps and dreams tulips.\nWe spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. \"People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. \"They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.\"\nNonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower \u2013 enough to have made it her career. \"I think it's the excitement,\" she says. \"It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.\"\u00a0\nHere are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.\n1. Best overall: Keukenhof\n\"So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,\" says Panis-Ringersma.\nEstablished in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped \"inspirational\" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. \"Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. \"It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.\"\n\u00a0\nResponsible Flower Viewing\nTourists, take note; in the Netherlands, it's illegal to park near or walk through tulip fields. \"Flower fields are commercial fields,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can damage crops by entering with your normal shoes, when you bring in bacteria, especially the hyacinths are very sensitive to that. And you don't want to have people over in the fields taking photos, picking flowers over there. Some tourists think that the fields are for there for them.\"\nVisitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic \"whisper boat\" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). \"The best time to go is the $1m question,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's different every year\u2026 right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.\"\nWebsite: https://keukenhof.nl/en/\nAddress: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse\nContact: info@keukenhof.nl\nInstagram: @visitkeukenhof\n2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade\nTo truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.\u00a0\n\"A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment\u2026 every town is a very festive atmosphere.\"\nInsider Bloemencorso Flower Parade tip\nPanis-Ringersma encourages visitors to also catch the events surrounding parade day. \"Not many people know that there's the Night Parade on Friday evening,\" she says. \"It's in Noordwijkerhout, a very small town. People gather there to look at the parade floats, have a drink and have something to eat outside on the terrace.\" During the Night Parade, the floats are illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere.\nAnd on float Construction Days (Wednesday to Friday), spectators can watch volunteers decorate the floats with thousands of flowers. On Sunday afternoon, after the parade, the floats are displayed for one last time in the city of Haarlem.\nThe Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. \"It's a full day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure\u2026 it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.\"\nPanis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. \"Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,\" she says. \"But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.\"\nWhile waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. \"It's a very festive day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"Every town is having markets \u2026 it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.\"\nWebsite: https://bloemencorso-bollenstreek.nl/en/\nPhone: +31 (0)252 428 237\nInstagram: @bloemencorsobollenstreek\n3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm\nFor those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. \"Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,\" she says. \"So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!\"\nPanis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. \"All three are founded by bulb growers,\" she says. \"So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.\"\nThe family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. \"You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience.\" What sort of tulip products? \"Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,\" she says. \"If you can name it, everything with tulips.\"\nAlternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. \"They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"So, for a bit younger target audience.\"\nHeading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. \"You can go together with the bulb grower,\" she says. \"You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.\"\nWebsite: https://tulipexperienceamsterdam.nl\nAddress: Delfweg 37, 2211 VK Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands\nPhone: +31651368784\nInstagram: @tulipexperienceamsterdam\n4. Best for kids: Tulip picking\nFor visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. \"Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'\" she says. \"No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.\"\nTulip Road Trip Map\nWhen roaming the Bollenstreek, it's helpful to have a plan \u2013 like Panis-Ringersma's helpful tulip road trip map; perfect for navigating the area by car or by bike.\n\"The green map square is Keukenhof,\" she explains. \"All the yellow stars are flower fields. The pink line is a long route among various flower fields; the blue is a route towards the beach. And when you drive by bike or by car, you will absolutely find tulip fields in bloom regardless the time of season during springtime.\"\nThere are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. \"Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',\" explains Panis-Ringersma. \"Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.\"\nWebsite: https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl\nAddress: Haarlemmerstraat 15A, 2182 HA Hillegom, Netherlands\nPhone: +31653839979\nInstagram: @pickinggardenholland\n5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum\nFor Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.\nDid You Know?\n\"An interesting fact about tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's not native to the Netherlands but people think it is.\" Tulips are, in fact, native to the Himalayas, where they flourished as a small red mountain flower before being brought to Turkey in the 1400s. \"People from Turkey went to the Himalayas and took this magical flower,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They thought, 'Oh, it's very interesting. Let's see if we can make it taller or different colours.' At the end of the 16th Century, it came to the Netherlands. People would have thought, 'Okay, it's a very ugly bulb, but there comes a beautiful flower out of it.'\"\n\"It's like a living museum,\" she says. \"Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.\"\nThe Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.\n\"So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.\"\nWebsite: https://hortus-bulborum.nl/en/\nAddress: Zuidkerkenlaan 23A, 1906 AC Limmen, Netherlands\nPhone: +31617291643\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hortusbulborum/\n\u00a0\nThis article was originally published 31 March 2024 and has been updated to reflect the 2025 opening and closing dates for Keukenhof Gardens.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Debra Eichenbaum got her two young children vaccinated against the measles virus 20 years ago, and - like millions of other parents - hadn't thought about the highly contagious disease since.\nBut when cases across the US began to climb this year, the 62-year-old began to worry about how best to protect her husband, David, who is immunocompromised after surviving pancreatic cancer.\nSo she got another measles shot, and emailed friends her age, encouraging them to check with their doctors to make sure they were still immunised.\n\"There's no downside to it,\" she said. \"For me, that was a no-brainer.\"\nMs Eichenbaum is just one adult who debated an extra shot when cases spiked across the US. Others are thinking about their children, who may not yet have been immunised against the virus.\n\"There is a lot of confusion out there right now, especially in light of differences in how different age groups of the population have been vaccinated based on what the recommendations were at the time of their vaccination,\" said Donald Dumford III, an infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic.\nThe US declared it had eliminated measles from the country in 2000, after decades of access to a safe and effective vaccine. But since the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase in vaccine scepticism, the number of measles outbreaks has risen.\nThere have been over 300 cases in 2025 across more than a dozen states. This year, the US saw the first measles death in a decade: a 6-year-old girl in western Texas, the epicentre of an outbreak that has spread to neighbouring New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nMeasles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly. \nVaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases that exists, spreading very easily if people are unprotected, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nHealth Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine-sceptic, has sent mixed messages about the outbreak, at times encouraging people to talk to their doctor about vaccines, and at other moments, promoting alternative treatments not recommended by public health experts.\nThe federal government has not offered any guidance about whether certain adults should talk to their doctor about getting another shot - or whether parents in hotspots should consider getting their young children vaccinated sooner.\nAsked for comment, the US Department of Health and Human Services referred the BBC to existing measles vaccine guidance from the CDC.\nMs Eichenbaum decided on another measles vaccine over concerns that some people vaccinated in the 1960s may have received a less effective dose. \nThose vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 may have received what is known as an inactivated measles vaccine, and should consider getting an additional shot, said Melissa Stockwell, a professor of paediatrics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\nThose who are unsure about their vaccination status can either search for their written vaccination records or have their antibody levels checked with a blood test, doctors say.\nAdults born earlier than 1957 likely had measles as a child and are considered immune, Dr Stockwell said.\n\"The recommendation is that anyone who does not have presumptive immunity should be vaccinated,\" she said.\nFor weeks before his new baby was born, Kyle Rable and his pregnant wife exchanged anxious messages throughout the day, wondering how they could best keep their future son safe from measles.\n\"It's basically both of our constant thoughts all the time,\" said Mr Rable, whose wife gave birth to their son, Steven, earlier this month in the same hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where a child died of measles just a week before.\nThe outbreak in western Texas has raised the alarm for parents across the state and in the wider region, especially those who have young babies who cannot yet be immunised.\nThe measles vaccine is not generally recommended for children who are under a year old because the shots do not work as well before that age, doctors say. \nIt is a two-dose vaccine. Typically, children are given their first shot between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and then another between ages 4 and 6.\nBut for young children who live near a measles outbreak, paediatricians may recommend a shot at an earlier age, between six and 11 months, said Stuart Ray, professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nMr Rable plans to ask about vaccination plans at his son's two-week checkup, and will \"100%\" vaccinate his child early if the doctor recommends it.\nChildren vaccinated before they are a year old still need two additional standard doses of the measles vaccine later on, Dr Ray said.\n\"There's no harm in getting the additional doses,\" said Tony Moody, a paediatrics professor at Duke University School of Medicine. \"The decision about getting an early MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) should be a conversation between the family and their paediatrician.\"\nChildren can get a second dose as soon as 28 days after their first shot.\n\"The vaccine starts providing some protection within weeks of the first dose,\" Dr Ray said.\nParents hoping to get their children vaccinated against measles, or adults looking for another dose, can make an appointment at a pharmacy. \nHowever, some pharmacies - especially in Texas, the epicentre of the outbreak - have seen vaccine shortages because of higher demand.  \nThe CDC has provided thousands of doses to the state. \nLocal health departments in western Texas also are holding vaccination clinics, while many across the US offer the shot free of charge.

That's how his coaching career started.\n\"It was clear he shouldn't be working in a bar and would much rather be on a pitch with a team.\"\nThomas Tuchel was managing in the German Bundesliga at the age of 35 with Mainz\nTuchel worked with Stuttgart Under-15s and a few years later would guide their under-19s to their league title.\nHis first managerial role came in 2007 at FC Augsburg II and two years later he was in charge of Bundesliga outfit Mainz, who had Jurgen Klopp among their former bosses.\nRangnick was not surprised Tuchel would manage at the top level and added: \"Thomas is a very bright, intelligent person. He studied sports in Stuttgart. It was obvious he had quite a few assets of what you need as a manager.\"\nTuchel would also learn from, and emulate, those around him.\nIn five years at Mainz, he qualified for Europe twice, guiding them to fifth in 2010-11, their best ever Bundesliga position.\n\"Tuchel is someone who has been influenced by a lot of managers and coaches \u2013 it's clear he has a constant desire to learn, to be open-minded and curious,\" said former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger.\n\"Ralf Rangnick is one of the coaches who has influenced him - what are you doing when you don't have the ball, how do you win it back, then how do you create chances and score goals?\n\"Tuchel took elements of that, but another element is focused on what you do with the ball too.\n\"With that aspect, Tuchel is very close to Pep Guardiola in terms of the way he thinks about football and how to create chances from your own possession.\n\"Pep was more of a coach he looked up to, in the time they spent together in the Bundesliga [when Guardiola was in charge of Bayern Munich] there was a bond, a relationship forged. They are still friends and they talk regularly.\"\nThomas Tuchel was sacked by Borussia Dortmund three days after winning the German Cup\nIn 2015, Tuchel began his next challenge, replacing Liverpool-bound Klopp as boss of Borussia Dortmund.\nDuring Klopp's seven years at Dortmund, he had won the Bundesliga twice and reached the Champions League final, and Tuchel had to win over his new players, with not all of them keen.\n\"I honestly didn't expect much when it was announced he was going to be the new manager. I was even in talks maybe to leave the club,\" recalled former Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan.\n\"I had one phone call with him and he presented himself to me when I was on holiday in the summer break, and it was actually a really good call.\n\"He tried to explain a few things, how he wanted us to play, how he wanted us to train and everything he said he proved during that season.\"\nGundogan joined Manchester City after Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga at the end of that 2015-16 campaign, while Tuchel claimed the first major trophy of his career, beating Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 in the final of the German Cup in May 2017, in what proved to be his last match at the club.\nFormer Germany international Gundogan, though, was completely won over by Tuchel in their sole season together.\n\"I can only say positive things about him from when we were at Dortmund,\" he added. \"He's outstanding tactically and extremely honest and open. Personally, I got along very well with him.\"\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel's man-management skills would be key to success with England and added: \"The players Tuchel has worked with in the past are very positive about him, and the way he communicates his ideas to them.\n\"I don't think the fact he is German will make any difference. Most of the England players work under foreign managers, or have done. He's a top manager so they will be open to his ideas and used to most of them, so it should be a smooth transition.\"\nRangnick added: \"He's somebody who loves to improve people. As a head coach, you need to be analytic and intelligent. He is curious, funny with a good sense of humour. A very specific humour and, if you know the humour, he can be funny.\"\nThomas Tuchel won Uefa Men's Coach of the Year for 2020-21 after guiding Chelsea to the Champions League\nApart from his almost five-year spell at Mainz, all of Tuchel's jobs have followed a similar pattern \u2013 successful, but not in the same role for long.\nAfter Dortmund, he won Ligue 1 twice and took Paris St-Germain to the Champions League final in a two-and-a-half-year spell.\nChelsea came next, getting the job in January 2021 and winning the Champions League just four months later, beating Guardiola and Gundogan's Manchester City side 1-0 in the final.\nHowever, despite also winning the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup, he was sacked in September 2022.\nBefore England, Bayern Munich was his last managerial job in March 2023, and he instantly won the Bundesliga title within a few months, but was gone at the end of the next campaign - a season that ended without any silverware despite the goals of England captain Harry Kane.\nThis video can not be played\n'We have to free ourselves from history' - new England boss Tuchel\n\"Thomas is not an easy person, or easy to deal with, but all good coaches are complicated,\" said Christian Heidel, Mainz's long-time executive and sporting director, in 2021.\n\"Complicated means they are also tough. They make demands of those around them, their players from morning to night and for that reason, they are incredible coaches.\"\nFormer Augsburg youth coach Heiner Schuhmann described Tuchel as \"an outstanding, passionate player on the pitch, who gave his all\", but felt \"he was so exacting and demanding, which didn't go down well with some of the players\".\nHitzlsperger also felt Tuchel could \"rub people up the wrong way\" in his dealings with club officials and would have to try to avoid that happening with the English Football Association.\n\"It's important Tuchel maintains a good relationship with the FA, the people who have brought him in, and he has to handle the media and public,\" said the former Aston Villa and Stuttgart midfielder.\n\"The same thing must not happen that happened in Bayern and Dortmund, where he fell out with his bosses. I am optimistic there won't be too many disagreements, because at his previous clubs it was often about transfers, which as a national team manager is not an issue.\n\"With the media and the fans, it's different. The advantage he has is he has worked in this country before with Chelsea, so knows what English fans are like.\"\nThomas Tuchel's England side have been drawn in World Cup Qualifying Group K, along with Albania, Andorra, Latvia and Serbia\nTuchel started the England job on 1 January and has been regularly spotted at Premier League matches.\nHe has already shown he will do the job his way, handing a surprise recall to 34-year-old Ajax midfielder Jordan Henderson, as well as first international call-ups for 32-year-old Newcastle defender Dan Burn and 18-year-old Arsenal left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly.\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer felt Tuchel would want to get the best out of the team immediately and said: \"We've been down the route so many times of an English manager having this hope, this belief in three or four years' time we might be this.\n\"This manager has been brought in for now, for the next 18 months, to win the World Cup. That's his job. If he doesn't win the World Cup he won't be here.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBrotherhood, Ben White and playing style - Tuchel answers key questions\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel could succeed and his nationality would soon be ignored if England were winning matches.\n\"His experience in club management will help him with England,\" he added. \"He had to deal with some of the biggest names in world football at PSG for example, and was expected to win everything in France and in European competition.\n\"Hopefully the players want to play for their country because they think this is fun, they play good football and enjoy the way they play.\n\"He will get people excited and out of their seats, thinking 'this is great football, this is what we wanted to see'.\"\nThe 2026 World Cup will be held in Canada, the United States and Mexico and Tuchel will be aiming to become only the second manager to guide England to World Cup glory after Sir Alf Ramsey in 1966.\n\"I would never say, 'he is going to win the World Cup', but he has got one of the best squads in the world, along with Spain, France, Argentina, and Brazil,\" said Hitzlsperger.\n\"Tuchel is probably hoping to play Germany at some stage. Can you imagine? Putting one over Germany in a World Cup \u2013 that would be very sweet for him and it probably wouldn't get any bigger.\n\"If he were to put one over them it would be one of the biggest achievements, just after winning the World Cup, and beating Germany on the way would be fantastic for him.\"\nThis video can not be played\nEngland played with fear, we have to change that - Tuchel",

When asked by the judge whether he had read the 12-page indictment, he reportedly responded, \"Not cover to cover\".\nHe was released on a $100,000 bail, and he is expected to attend trial in New York at a later date.

        "article_text": "The government has unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the overhaul would create a more \"pro-work system\" to encourage people to take up jobs, while protecting those who cannot work.\nThe changes will make it harder for people with less severe conditions to claim disability payments. Extra benefit payments for health conditions will also be frozen for current claimants and nearly halved for new applicants. \nAnd people aged under 22 could be prevented from claiming universal credit top-up payments for health conditions.\nThe government has not given a precise breakdown of the forecast savings but the bulk are expected to come from changes to eligibility for disability payments. \nThe overall benefits bill will continue to rise - but Kendall told the BBC the changes would put welfare on a more \"sustainable footing\" by getting people into work.\nSpending on health and disability-related benefits has ballooned since the Covid pandemic, and has been forecast to increase from \u00a365bn a year currently to \u00a3100bn by 2029.\nThe proposals are the result of months of work but they have become more urgent with the worsening economic backdrop, which has made it more difficult for the government to meet its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.\nCharities and some Labour MPs are worried benefit cuts will push disabled people into poverty. \nThe government responded to their concerns by scrapping plans to freeze personal independence payments (Pips), which provide extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition.\nBut Kendall said eligibility for Pips - the main disability benefit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - would be tightened from November 2026. \nIt will become harder to qualify for the daily living component of Pip, which is for people who need help with everyday tasks and starts at \u00a372.65 a week. \nThere will be no change to the mobility component, for those who need help getting around.\nKendall told the BBC details on how many people would be affected would be set out alongside Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement next week. \nThe Resolution Foundation think tank has estimated between 800,000 and 1.2 million people could lose support because of restrictions on claiming Pip.\nKendall also announced work capability assessments, which are used to determine whether someone is fit to work and if they can receive additional benefits payments because of a health condition or disability, would be scrapped in 2028.\nShe said the assessments were \"complex, time-consuming and often stressful for claimants\", as well as being based \"on a binary can-can't work divide\".\nIn the future, financial support for health conditions will only be available through the Pip assessment, based on the impact of someone's health condition rather than their capacity to work. \nReassessments to determine whether someone is still eligible for benefits will increase, although those with the most severe conditions that will never improve will not be reassessed. \nFrom April next year the extra amount of universal credit for a health condition or disability will be frozen for existing claimants until 2029/30 and cut by almost half for new claimants.\nThere will be an additional premium for people with severe, lifelong conditions that mean they will never work.\nMeanwhile, there will be a permanent, above-inflation rise to the standard allowance of universal credit \u2013 equivalent to a \u00a3775 annual increase in cash terms by 2029/30.\nThe government will also introduce a \"right to try\" to guarantee that people who try out a job will not lose their existing benefits if it does not work out.\nThe Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents more than 100 charities and organisations, said: \"These immoral and devastating benefits cuts will push more disabled people into poverty, and worsen people's health.\"\nThe SNP said the measures would \"harm the most vulnerable\" and \"mark the start of a new era of austerity cuts\".\nDebbie Abrahams, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, argued there were \"more compassionate ways to balance the books rather than on the back of sick and disabled people\".\nHowever, other Labour MPs agree with the government that there is a moral case for reforming the welfare system to encourage people into work.\nThe Conservatives said the changes were \"too little, too late\" and needed to be \"tougher\".\nShadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately asked why the government was only planning to save \u00a35bn annually, when the total bill for health and disability benefits is forecast to rise to more than \u00a3100bn a year by 2029/30.\nLiberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said: \"If the government was serious about cutting welfare spending it would get serious about fixing health and social care and the broken Department of Work and Pensions.\"\nSome of the changes will require new legislation, raising the prospect of a rebellion by some Labour MPs during votes in Parliament.\nHowever, the size of the government's majority limits the threat from a vote. \nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "article_text": "Flights around the world have been disrupted after Heathrow Airport closed due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation.\nHeathrow, the UK's busiest airport, said on Friday afternoon that they will \"restart\" some flights later after the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London. The airport said it hoped \"to run a full operation\" on Saturday,\nMore than 1,300 flights were affected, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers have been told not to travel to the airport unless their airline has advised them to. \nThe National Grid said earlier that an \"interim solution\" has been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network has been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added when the power outage happened the back up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nPassengers were urged not to travel to the airport unless their airline had advised them to do so on Friday.\nThe airport is hoping to run a normal service on Saturday, Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye said.\nThe travel disruption affected many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nThe National Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.\nIn the meantime, customers have been told not to go to the airport unless their airline has advised them to.\nBut Mr Woldbye said the airport would be \"back in full operation\" on Saturday.",

Oh, and try to win things at the same time.\nWith an average age of 23 years and five months, the Blues already have the youngest squad in the Premier League - and it is set to get even younger from next season. \nThe club has had a radical shift in transfer strategy since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over from Roman Abramovich in 2022. \nMost Abramovich-era players have been sold in an attempt to reduce the age of the squad - and the wage bill. \nThat money has then been reinvested in young talent in what appears to be a 'supercharged Brighton' approach to transfer business. \nYoung players are being signed on long contracts, usually between seven and nine years, for reasons which co-owner Boehly explained at last month's FT Business of Football event.\n\"It is the way this market operates,\" the American billionaire said. \"I don't see it as good or bad. \n\"You always focus on how you keep something together for a very long time. How? You identify a younger portfolio of players to be consistent and reliable over a long period of time - and that's an option that's valuable...\n\"A seven-year contract is really a five-year contract as 90% of the time you have to make a decision or shoot yourself in the foot [with a player trying to run down their contract]. \n\"You either agree terms, or shoot yourself in the foot, or agree there are greener pastures out there.\"\nA recent CIES Football Observatory report, external revealed Chelsea are the best performing team in world football when measuring how many minutes (almost 92%) are being played by players under contracts beyond 2026.\nIn other words - the clubs where squad planning is \"most likely to bring stability\" in the coming years or to \"generate substantial capital gains\" from transfers.\nChelsea are clearly betting on a host of highly rated youngsters from across the globe in the hope they will unearth more stars like Cole Palmer or Nicolas Jackson. \nThey also want to beat clubs like Benfica to rising stars in markets like South America to avoid paying a 'Portuguese premium', like they did when signing Enzo Fernandez for \u00a3107m in 2023. \n\"We knew there was going to be a big transition,\" Chelsea co-sporting director Paul Winstanley said in 2023. \"No chance to sit back and relax, that's for sure. Did we think we would oversee a Premier League record of transactions? Probably not.\" \nThat constant desire to trade players has slowed down a little after a series of record-breaking transfer windows in terms of both volume and spending.\nThe accounting model makes some sense as the long contracts and amortisation - spreading the cost of a transfer over an extended period - have enabled Chelsea to get players like Caicedo on comparatively 'lower' \u00a3180,000-a-week wages, despite him costing a British transfer record \u00a3115m when joining in 2023 from Brighton. \nUkraine winger Mykhailo Mudryk - who joined Chelsea for up to \u00a389m, inclusive of add-ons, from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2023 - is on 'just' \u00a397,000 a week on a contract running to 2031. He is one example of how players can spread lower baseline earnings across a longer deal.\nBut there can be issues with those lengthier contracts. \nMudryk is currently suspended after testing positive for a banned substance. If found guilty, he could face up to a four-year ban, while still having years on his Chelsea deal.\nAnd then what if a player wants out? On the Overlap podcast, Jamie Carragher asked whether any club could afford to buy Chelsea's star man Palmer.\nLast year, the playmaker renewed his contract until 2033, but Carragher said he can see the 22-year-old's \"frustration\" with some underperforming team-mates.\n\"It reminded me of Stevie [Gerrard] at Liverpool at times, because he was so much better than everyone else and he got frustrated. Stevie was a local player, but he was never going to leave, whereas Cole Palmer isn't. \n\"This is when I go back to those eight-year contracts, and whether they are good for the club and players. \n\"If you're Palmer, who's got six or seven years left on his deal, and he should be playing for a team looking to win the Champions League, how does he get out?\"\nThis is uncharted territory and, although it makes sense on a balance sheet, is the human aspect being overlooked?\nThere are also young players like Cesare Casadei, Renato Veiga and Carney Chukwuemeka who all left Chelsea in January amid various frustrations about a lack of minutes available, with multiple young stars all vying for the same roles. \nForward Christopher Nkunku, who was made available to other clubs in January - and other players such as midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who only joined last summer - face uncertainty before the next transfer window.\nChelsea sources continue to insist they have no issues with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) and have yet to fall foul of them under this ownership.\nHowever, it took what was described as a 'fire sale' of talent and the sale of two hotels to a sister company to continue adhering to the financial controls. \nChelsea have also been involved in a couple of so-called 'PSR swap deals' - with academy talent Ian Maatsen moving to Aston Villa as Omari Kellyman joined the Blues.\nQualifying for the Champions League would also help bolster the club's finances - and a major factor behind playing without a front-of-shirt sponsor is that the Blues are waiting to qualify for Europe's premier competition to negotiate a better rate. \nAnother positive on the horizon for Chelsea's finances is their involvement in this summer's expanded Club World Cup in the United States, when they are expected to receive more than \u00a350m to take part.\nIt is unlikely, therefore, that any marquee players will be sold but academy defender Trevoh Chalobah is still expected to leave to create more PSR headroom in the summer.\nKieron O'Connor, who writes the Swiss Ramble football finance blog, told BBC Sport: \"The only thing we know for sure with Chelsea's PSR situation is that they were compliant for the three-year monitoring period up to 2023-24, as the Premier League has confirmed that no clubs were in breach.\n\"Chelsea have not yet published their accounts for last season, but I reckon that the only way that they could have kept below the maximum \u00a3105m loss was by applying some fancy financial footwork.\n\"The expectation is they will have made a huge operating loss, as they did not qualify for Europe, while they have also struggled to replace shirt and sleeve sponsors. This will be partially offset by hefty player sales, but they will still need to find money elsewhere, such as the sale of the women's football club.\n\"The 2024-25 assessment will benefit from dropping the large 2021-22 loss, but compliance would still be dependent on the significant inter-company transactions. The big question is whether Uefa will also accept these exceptional credits, as their regulations are tighter than the Premier League's.\"\nWhere there is a real need to sell players is simply to get the squad numbers down as Chelsea look to move away from using loans for unwanted talent, like Ben Chilwell to Crystal Palace and Raheem Sterling to Arsenal, and instead try to develop young players at lower league and European clubs.\nChelsea believe within two loan spells they should be able to tell whether a young player is capable of making it at Stamford Bridge, and would look to sell a player quickly if they do not believe they can make the grade.\nDuring a vocal minority protest against the ownership at the recent match against Southampton, one common complaint was whether Chelsea could win trophies with a strategy similar to Brighton.\nIf Chelsea do not pay top-level wages, will the best players join the club? And doesn't experience count for something?\nChelsea's owners, and those close to them, have always highlighted their desire to win and ambitions to match expectations in the longer term. \nHowever, they want to do so with this current approach and have urged patience to wait for their players and this project to reach a mature stage. \nOne source suggested to BBC Sport that the project is at 'Everest Base Camp' - the starting point to climb the world's largest mountain.\nThose ambitions for major honours extend beyond just the Conference League, where Chelsea's squad was worth as much as the other 31 teams combined. \nSources close to senior players at Chelsea say they want stability having had three permanent managers and five including interim bosses across two seasons. \nAfter the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal at Emirates Stadium last weekend, Caicedo said \"they are working seven years together, and us just two years\". \nMaresca has also echoed those calls when explaining why Chelsea cannot be title contenders this season, pointing towards the time needed for Mikel Arteta, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp to build their imposing teams.  \nChelsea's ownership subscribe to that view and currently believe Maresca works within the project better than his predecessors Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel did, while getting better results than Graham Potter - who was sacked over results rather than a culture clash. \nHere are some fan views on the latest signings from the BBC Sport Chelsea page:\nGarry: Will either of them play in goal or as a striker then? I thought not. This is just more pointless stockpiling of young talent, with a view to cash in on potential demand further down the line. We are slowly becoming irrelevant as a club. I can't even be bothered to get annoyed with it all any more.\nClive: Off the back of rumours that we are going to be selling Enzo Fernandez, we have signed two more midfielders. That is OK, but where is the experienced and proven striker who is able to back up Nicolas Jackson and help his decision-making and scoring skills?\nNicholas: It's building a portfolio of players not building a team. I've become numb to the players coming into the club.\nTristan: These latest deals have summed up the Boehly ownership era, showing a lack of direction. When you think we are done spending too much money on young players, Boehly comes up trumps and spends insane amounts on players. Our ownership and management are equally poor - dramatic change is needed now.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Repeated failures in how CTs, X-rays and other medical scans are being interpreted are leading to avoidable patient deaths and delays in diagnosing cancer, England's health ombudsman has warned. \nThe most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly.\nThe ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again. \nNHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\".\nIn one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO).\nThe man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021. \nA scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel.\nHowever, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery.\nThe patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home. \nLater that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body. \nJust months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain. \nThe ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions. \nFailings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests. \nThe man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen. \n\"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\"\nA statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made. \n\"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\"\nThe trust has also agreed to pay the family \u00a34,000, as recommended by PHSO. \nIn another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise. \nThe patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday. \nHis brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it. \n\"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\"\nThe man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital.\nHowever, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nHe died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous.\nIf the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said.\nWhile the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life.\nHis brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\"\nIn a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident.\n\"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\"\nThe trust has agreed to pay the family \u00a33,500. \nMs Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care. \n\"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\"\nThe 2021 ombudsman report into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\".\nIt is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added.\nDr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements. \n\"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said. \n\"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\"\nThe college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028. \nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\"\nThe spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\".\nChanges were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.",

        "article_text": "Aldcroft was one of the 32 players to be given full-time contracts in 2024\nGuinness Women's Six Nations: England v Italy\nVenue: Community Stadium, York Date: Sunday, 23 March Kick-off: 15:00 GMT\nCoverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sport website and app.\nFrom being the only girl in her first team to becoming the best player in the world, Zoe Aldcroft has always been a special talent.\nNow as captain of the leading team in women's Test rugby, the 28-year-old has been tasked with leading England to World Cup glory.\nAldcroft, who has been capped 58 times, will start her England captaincy journey against Italy on Sunday in the first round of the Six Nations.\nLike other Red Roses, Aldcroft started playing rugby as the only girl on her team at the age of eight.\nStarting at Scarborough RUFC, a typical small town, family-based rugby club, she was, as described by minis coach Nigel Wilson, \"quiet, shy, reserved and not a particularly outgoing person, but she was keen to give rugby a go\".\nAnd having watched her brother and dad play from a young age she was keen to prove she could tackle just as hard as the boys could.\n\"She just mixed in with the boys and got straight into it,\" Wilson told BBC Sport. \n\"She didn't hold back anything from tackling boys.\"\nAt the time, rugby was a male-dominated sport with few female role models but Aldcroft never felt like she was a \"lesser player because she was a girl\". \nBut Rugby Football Union regulations mean boys and girls cannot mix in the same team once they turn 12, forcing Aldcroft to switch clubs to nearby Malton Girls and then slightly further afield to West Park Leeds.\nZoe Aldcroft with her team at Scarborough rugby club [second row, end person] \nAldcroft has played an influential part in multiple Women's Six Nations titles, was named World Rugby women's player of the year in 2021 and was part of the England team that reached the World Cup final in 2022.\nHer most recent achievement was co-captaining her club side Gloucester-Hartpury to a third successive Premiership Women's Rugby title.\nBut one accolade that her home club holds on to is that Aldcroft is the only Scarborough rugby player in 100 years to become an international. \n\"She's just head and shoulders above everybody else,\" said Wilson. \n\"Nobody [from the borough of Scarborough] has ever captained England in a major sport.\"\nAldcroft, a lock who can also play in the back row, has never forgotten her roots, taking former Scarborough player Steph Else under her wing when she signed for Gloucester-Hartpury and inspiring the next generation of female players.\n\"She's not a person who has gone away and stays away,\" added Wilson.\n\"When she comes back and coaches the players, she spends an evening with them to answer their questions and will sign every autograph, no matter how tired she is. \n\"She couldn't be a better role model for young girls.

I didn't realise I would be so homesick but it was the best two years I have ever experienced.\n\"I hoped one day I would be able to play for England, so I concentrated on that dream.\"\nSean Lynn, now head coach of Wales women, first encountered a 16-year-old Aldcroft when he was teaching at Hartpury.\nIt was not long before he had a conversation with Red Rose head coach Simon Middleton about a player he \"can't fault\". \n\"'She's not going to be a leader by her outspoken words, this girl will lead by example',\" said Lynn, who became head coach of Gloucester-Hartpury in 2020.\n\"On and off the pitch, she is just a professional individual.\n\"She is that warrior queen but what I love about her is she demands high standards in training.\"\nAldcroft signed for Darlington Mowden Park Shark in 2015, representing England under-20s for two years before making an instant impact on her senior England debut in November 2016.\nComing on in the closing stages against then Six Nations champions France, she scored the winning try in a 17-13 victory.\nNext year she signed for Gloucester-Hartpury and in 2018 was named co-captain with Natasha Hunt, while establishing herself in the England squad.\n\"Once you get a little taste of it you just want more,\" she said. \"I am just so hungry to keep developing with the teams.\"\nGloucester-Hartpury claim third straight PWR title\nHunt and Aldcroft led Gloucester-Hartpury to a third successive domestic title earlier this month\nAldcroft, who had captained on occasion already in her career, replaced Marlie Packer as permanent captain of the Red Roses in January this year with head coach John Mitchell saying captaincy would bring the best out of her. \n\"The values it takes to be a high-performing Red Rose are ingrained in her character and she is highly respected within the squad,\" he said. \"We believe Zoe will thrive in the role.\"\nJuggling being the captain of the best Premiership team and the world's best international side is a \"stressful job\" but Aldcroft believes setting an example to her team-mates every day in training is key.\n\"If you have the ability to work hard and push your own boundaries that's the most important thing,\" she said.\n\"In rugby, you are looking for people to put their bodies on the line, people who will go that extra step.

        "article_text": "\"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y.\nBen is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.\n\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"\nBen is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.\nMusk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nFor some who do not share his views, it has all become too much. \nThere have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal. \nAlthough most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.\nIn the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.\nUS President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".\nMusk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\nWhat is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers. \nAnd if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?\nTwo decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.\nMusk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.\n\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"\nIt is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.\nNowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.\nLike the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.\nBut recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.\nAlthough its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.\nThe decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.\nThis year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia. \nMeanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.\nIn early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.\nSales can fall for many reasons, but research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.\nIn the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"\nTesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.\nBut experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.\nTo start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.\n\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"\nProf Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"\nCompetition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.\nAt the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.\n\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.\n\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"\nThe extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.\nMusk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.\nIn January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.\nIn 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.\n\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.\nArguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.\nAsked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".\n\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.\n\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"\nEver since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.\nThat is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.\nFor those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.\nToday, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.\n\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.\nNone of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.\nBut analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.\n\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"\n\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.\n\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Don't judge a blob by its cover.\nOnce dubbed the world's ugliest animal for its soft, lumpy appearance, the blobfish has made a stunning comeback: it was crowned this week as Fish of the Year by a New Zealand environmental group.\nThe annual competition, held by the Mountain to Sea Conservation Trust, aims to raise awareness for New Zealand's freshwater and marine life.\nThis year, the blobfish took home the coveted accolade with nearly 1,300 out of more than 5,500 votes cast.\nIt's an underdog victory for the blobfish, which burst into mainstream notoriety as the mascot for the Ugly Animal Preservation Society in 2013.\nThe gelatinous fish lives on the sea bed and grows to about 12in (30cm) in length. They're mainly found off the coast of Australia, where they live at depths of 2,000-4,000 ft (600-1,200m).\n\n\nWhile the blobfish is known for its misshapen silhouette, in its natural deep-sea habitat it actually resembles a regular fish, with its shape kept together by the high water pressure.\nHowever, when caught and rapidly brought to the water surface its body deforms into its hallmark mushy shape - the same one that has earned it the reputation of being among the ugliest creatures the world has seen.\nComing in second place was the orange roughy, a deep-sea fish in the slimehead family - known for the mucous canals on their heads.\nIt was \"a battle of the deep sea forget-me-nots,\" said Kim Jones, co-director of the Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust. \"A battle of two quirky deep sea critters, with the blobfish's unconventional beauty helping get voters over the line.\"\nThe orange roughy had appeared on track for the win, until a couple of local radio station hosts started a passionate campaign for the blobfish.\n\"There is an up and coming fish, it needs your vote,\" Sarah Gandy and Paul Flynn, hosts of local radio network More FM, urged listeners on their show last week. \"We need the blobfish to win.\"\nNews of the blobfish's victory has been celebrated by the radio hosts. \n\"The blobfish had been sitting patiently on the ocean floor, mouth open waiting for the next mollusc to come through to eat,\" the pair said. \"He has been bullied his whole life and we thought, 'Stuff this, it's time for the blobfish to have his moment in the sun', and what a glorious moment it is!\"\nBesides molluscs, the blobfish also eats custaceans like crabs and lobsters, as well as sea urchins.\nInstead of a skeleton and scales, the blobfish has a soft body and flabby skin.\nNine of the ten nominees for fish of the year are considered by conservation groups to be vulnerable, according to the Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust. This includes the blobfish, which are vulnerable to deep-sea trawling.\nNew Zealand also has a Bird of the Year contest, organised by conservation organisation Forest & Bird.

        "article_text": "Nienke Panis-Ringersma has made a career out of following the region's famous blooms. Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.\nFew images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands \u2013 the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom \u2013 venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek \"Bulb Region\", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.\nThe SpeciaList\nNienke Panis-Ringersma is the owner of the photography and Dutch culture blog Tulips in Holland, which now also shares its tulip photos and weekly flower updates via X, Instagram and most recently TikTok. She is a licensed national tour guide, and her husband says she eats, sleeps and dreams tulips.\nWe spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. \"People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. \"They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.\"\nNonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower \u2013 enough to have made it her career. \"I think it's the excitement,\" she says. \"It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.\"\u00a0\nHere are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.\n1. Best overall: Keukenhof\n\"So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,\" says Panis-Ringersma.\nEstablished in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped \"inspirational\" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. \"Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. \"It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.\"\n\u00a0\nResponsible Flower Viewing\nTourists, take note; in the Netherlands, it's illegal to park near or walk through tulip fields. \"Flower fields are commercial fields,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can damage crops by entering with your normal shoes, when you bring in bacteria, especially the hyacinths are very sensitive to that. And you don't want to have people over in the fields taking photos, picking flowers over there. Some tourists think that the fields are for there for them.\"\nVisitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic \"whisper boat\" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). \"The best time to go is the $1m question,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's different every year\u2026 right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.\"\nWebsite: https://keukenhof.nl/en/\nAddress: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse\nContact: info@keukenhof.nl\nInstagram: @visitkeukenhof\n2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade\nTo truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.\u00a0\n\"A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment\u2026 every town is a very festive atmosphere.\"\nInsider Bloemencorso Flower Parade tip\nPanis-Ringersma encourages visitors to also catch the events surrounding parade day. \"Not many people know that there's the Night Parade on Friday evening,\" she says. \"It's in Noordwijkerhout, a very small town. People gather there to look at the parade floats, have a drink and have something to eat outside on the terrace.\" During the Night Parade, the floats are illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere.\nAnd on float Construction Days (Wednesday to Friday), spectators can watch volunteers decorate the floats with thousands of flowers. On Sunday afternoon, after the parade, the floats are displayed for one last time in the city of Haarlem.\nThe Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. \"It's a full day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure\u2026 it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.\"\nPanis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. \"Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,\" she says. \"But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.\"\nWhile waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. \"It's a very festive day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"Every town is having markets \u2026 it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.\"\nWebsite: https://bloemencorso-bollenstreek.nl/en/\nPhone: +31 (0)252 428 237\nInstagram: @bloemencorsobollenstreek\n3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm\nFor those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. \"Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,\" she says. \"So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!\"\nPanis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. \"All three are founded by bulb growers,\" she says. \"So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.\"\nThe family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. \"You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience.\" What sort of tulip products? \"Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,\" she says. \"If you can name it, everything with tulips.\"\nAlternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. \"They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"So, for a bit younger target audience.\"\nHeading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. \"You can go together with the bulb grower,\" she says. \"You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.\"\nWebsite: https://tulipexperienceamsterdam.nl\nAddress: Delfweg 37, 2211 VK Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands\nPhone: +31651368784\nInstagram: @tulipexperienceamsterdam\n4. Best for kids: Tulip picking\nFor visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. \"Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'\" she says. \"No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.\"\nTulip Road Trip Map\nWhen roaming the Bollenstreek, it's helpful to have a plan \u2013 like Panis-Ringersma's helpful tulip road trip map; perfect for navigating the area by car or by bike.\n\"The green map square is Keukenhof,\" she explains. \"All the yellow stars are flower fields. The pink line is a long route among various flower fields; the blue is a route towards the beach. And when you drive by bike or by car, you will absolutely find tulip fields in bloom regardless the time of season during springtime.\"\nThere are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. \"Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',\" explains Panis-Ringersma. \"Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.\"\nWebsite: https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl\nAddress: Haarlemmerstraat 15A, 2182 HA Hillegom, Netherlands\nPhone: +31653839979\nInstagram: @pickinggardenholland\n5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum\nFor Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.\nDid You Know?\n\"An interesting fact about tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's not native to the Netherlands but people think it is.\" Tulips are, in fact, native to the Himalayas, where they flourished as a small red mountain flower before being brought to Turkey in the 1400s. \"People from Turkey went to the Himalayas and took this magical flower,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They thought, 'Oh, it's very interesting. Let's see if we can make it taller or different colours.' At the end of the 16th Century, it came to the Netherlands. People would have thought, 'Okay, it's a very ugly bulb, but there comes a beautiful flower out of it.'\"\n\"It's like a living museum,\" she says. \"Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.\"\nThe Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.\n\"So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.\"\nWebsite: https://hortus-bulborum.nl/en/\nAddress: Zuidkerkenlaan 23A, 1906 AC Limmen, Netherlands\nPhone: +31617291643\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hortusbulborum/\n\u00a0\nThis article was originally published 31 March 2024 and has been updated to reflect the 2025 opening and closing dates for Keukenhof Gardens.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife and Travel, delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Travel, head over to our Facebook page or message us on X.",

        "article_text": "When you see pasta, your brain probably doesn't jump to the secrets of the universe. But for almost a century, physicists have puzzled over spaghetti's counterintuitive properties.\nYou might think physicists only ask the big questions. We mostly hear about the physics of the cosmic and the miniscule, the shape of our universe and the nature of the particles that fill it. But physicists, of course, have ordinary lives outside of the laboratory, and sometimes their way of questioning the universe spills over to their daily habits. There's one everyday item that seems to especially obsess them: spaghetti.\nGoing back at least a century, spaghetti has been the subject of rigorous studies. Through this research, physicists continue to learn new things about the solid state of matter, the chemistry of food and even draw connections to the origin of life. The steady torrent of spaghetti science helps to demonstrate that deep questions lurk in our ordinary routines, and that there are plenty of hungry physicists who can't stop asking them.\nFor example: how thin can spaghetti get? The typical spaghetto \u2013 the word for an individual strand of spaghetti \u2013 is between one and two mm thick (0.04-0.08in). But other long noodles vary widely in diameter, from udon at 4mm (0.16in) to angel hair at 0.8mm (0.03in). The thinnest handmade strands are called su filindeu, coming in at 0.4mm (0.02in), so slender that only a few women in Nuoro, Italy know how to make them.\nBut recently, a team of researchers at the University College London wondered if 21st Century lab equipment could do better. They used a technique called \"electro-spinning\". First, they dissolved flour into a special, electrically charged solution in a syringe. Then they held the syringe over a special, negatively-charged plate. \"This pulls the solution through the dispenser needle down towards the collector plate in a very stringy noodle-type shape,\" says Beatrice Britton, lead author of the study.\nWhen the solution dried, the researchers were left with a crisscrossing thread of incredibly thin spaghetti. \"To the naked eye, all you see is a sort of lasagna sheet,\" Britton says, but a powerful microscope reveals a mat made of strands as thin as 0.1mm (0.004in). These noodles are also much stiffer than regular spaghetti. Britton and her colleagues hope their research can be a step towards biodegradable alternatives to plastic \"nanofibres\", which are now used to filter liquids and treat wounds.\nThe world's thinnest spaghetti is just one recent example of how physicists can't seem to stop plying their tools on everybody's favourite carb. But physicists using their noodle on their noodles is no new thing. In 1949, Brown University physicist George F Carrier posed \"the spaghetti problem\" in The American Mathematical Monthly, which he deemed to be \"of considerable popular and academic interest\". Essentially, the problem amounts to: \"Why can't I slurp up a strand of spaghetti without getting sauce on my face\"?\nHis equations showed how the exposed strand swings about more wildly as it gets shorter and shorter, guaranteeing an eventual slap of the noodle against the slurper's lip \u2013 and the fateful sauce eruption Carrier so deplored. Sadly, his mathematical formulas offered no way around the face-slap. It's as deeply etched in the laws of the universe as the Big Bang.\nLater, two scientists inverted Carrier's pioneering study, exploring what happens when a stringy object slips out of a hole instead of being sucked in. They called their version the \"reverse spaghetti problem\", familiar to any impatient eater who's had to spit out burning pasta because they hadn't waited for it to cool. For now, no theoretical physicist has attempted the more complicated problem of two dogs slurping from either end of the same spaghetti strand.\u00a0\nThe great mid-century American physicist Richard Feynman helped unlock the riddles of quantum mechanics, explaining how the elementary particles that make up atoms interact with one another. But Feynman's enormous contribution to spaghetti physics is less widely known. One night, Feynman wondered why it's almost impossible to break a stick of spaghetti into two pieces instead of three. He and a colleague spent the rest of the evening snapping spaghetti sticks until they covered the kitchen floor.\nFeynman's interrogation into the counterintuitive physics of dry spaghetti sparked a quarter century of attempts to explain it. This finally happened in 2005, when two French researchers showed that spaghetti always breaks into two pieces \u2013 at first. But after the fracture, as the two bent pieces snap straight again, all their pent-up strain gets released in a shockwave, causing further splintering.\nIn 2018, a team of MIT scientists figured out how to stifle the shockwave \u2013 delicately twist the spaghetti strand before snapping it. Their method required lab equipment, but it reliably produced a perfect pair of fragments. Their work provided a new and deeper understanding of brittle rods that goes beyond spaghetti; the phenomenon of three-way fracturing is well-known to pole vaulters, for example.\nMy (Italian-American) mother taught me to break a bundle of dry spaghetti in half before putting it in boiling water, so it fits horizontally in the pot. I guess Feynman did the same, but it's an outrage to many of the world's spaghetti-eaters. If you're in the latter camp, then you place your dried spaghetti bundle upright in the pot of boiling water, then watch it slowly soften, buckle and submerge itself.\nThis familiar spaghetti behaviour may not seem like a puzzle, but try removing a recently-curled piece of spaghetti from the pot and letting it dry. It will stay curved rather than returning to its original straight length \u2013 something in those first few minutes irreversibly changes the composition of the spaghetti. In 2020, two physicists finally explained this spaghetti transmutation. It's due to a feature called \"viscoelasticity\" \u2013 a name for the unique way materials like spaghetti respond to physical stress. This special property allows water to flow through the strand's outer layers.\nThe strange mechanics of cooked spaghetti go even further. In one study, scientists dropped strands on the ground and measured how they coiled to learn about other elastic materials, from rope to DNA strands. In another, physicists tied spaghetti into knots and studied what types of strain would cause them to tear.\nSpaghetti physics even goes beyond the pasta itself \u2013 sauce is loaded with its own scientific mysteries. When eight Italian physicists met while doing research abroad in Germany, they found a shared frustration in the classic Roman dish cacio e pepe.\nThe sauce requires very few ingredients \u2013 it's basically a mixture of reserved pasta water and grated pecorino cheese \u2013 but they'd all experienced its mystifying fickleness. Often the cheese irreversibly clumps up, ruining the sauce. This is especially common when you cook it in large batches, which made the physicists hesitant to invite their German colleagues to dinner. \"We can't mess up cacio e pepe in front of German people,\" says Ivan Di Terlizzi, who studies statistical and biological physics at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany.\nFortunately, among them were some of the world's foremost experts on the physics of \"phase separation\", exactly the kind of congealing phenomenon that plagued their group dinners. Arguing about the phase separation of cacio e pepe, they realised it was flummoxing from a scientific perspective as well.\n\"This is actually a very interesting problem,\" says Daniel Maria Busiello, co-author on the cacio\u00a0study. \"So we decided to design an experimental apparatus to actually test all these things.\"\nThe \"apparatus\" consisted of a bath of water heated to a low temperature, a kitchen thermometer, a petri dish and an iPhone camera attached to an empty box. They invited as many hungry friends as they could find to Di Terlizzi's apartment and hunkered down to cook a weekend's worth of cacio e pepe.\u00a0\nThey found that the \"simple\" sauce was enormously complex. Chemically, it's a water-based solution with only a few components: starch (from the pasta water), lipids (from the cheese) and two kinds of protein (also from the cheese). Using their apparatus, they found a physical explanation for the sauce-wrecking clumps, which they termed the \"mozzarella phase\".\nProteins, unlike most molecules, get stickier when they're hot. As the sauce is heated, the researchers found this leads to these proteins sticking to the lipids and forming mozzarella-like clumps. In a well-made cacio e pepe, what prevents this is the starch, which forms a protective coat around the lipid molecules so they can't stick to the proteins. If the sauce gets too hot, the increased stickiness of the proteins overcomes this barrier.\nOnce they understood the science behind the sauce, it was clear how to fix it. \"If you add enough starch above a certain threshold, you don't get this kind of separated state,\" says Di Terlizzi. Pasta water doesn't typically contain enough starch to guarantee this threshold, so they suggest adding a mixture of corn starch dissolved in water.\nThe group decided to conclude their manuscript with a foolproof recipe for the classic dish. But in surveying the rich scientific literature, they realised they weren't the first to reach this cacio epiphany. In the name of academic integrity, they cited a YouTube video wherein the Michelin-star Roman chef Luciano Monosilio suggests the same tweak for a foolproof recipe \u2013 a dash of corn starch. \"It's the only non-scientific reference in our paper,\" says Di Terlizzi.\nThe physics they used connects the clumping of cacio e pepe to ideas about the origin of life on Earth. Biophysicists use phase separation to understand how droplets of liquid can congeal and divide within a solution. \"A droplet dividing pretty much looks like a proto-cell,\" says Giacomo Bartolucci, another co-author on the study. Inside the little blobs that preceded actual cells, some believe, the building blocks of life may have come together via a process much like the Italians\u2019 mozzarella phase. The same ideas are helping biologists understand how the plaques that cause Alzheimer's coalesce in the brain.\nWhy is spaghetti such a locus of speculation and study for physicists?\nFor one, it's simple \u2013 flour, water and heat, says Vishal Patil, one of the discoverers of the twist-and-break method who is now a professor of mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. The fact that a combination of so few components raises so many deep questions speaks to how physics underlies everything they see and do, Patil says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why sarcastic teens are the smartest\n\u2022 The French towns giving away free chickens\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\nIt also shows that no matter how deep physicists probe the big and the small, the answers can still fall short of explaining phenomena we see every day. When it comes to cacio e pepe, all the tools of theoretical physics can only tell us what every Italian grandmother knows: keep the stove burning low when you make it. Laboratory electrospinning can only achieve marginally thinner spaghetti than what the women of Nuoro, Italy make daily by hand.\n\"Spaghetti is just a very accessible thing you can play with,\" Patil says. The low cost of flour-based noodles is what made them a democratic delicacy for so many cultures around the world \u2013 spaghetti was popularised in Naples as street food. That's why Feynman didn't hesitate to snap pounds of the stuff onto his kitchen floor.\nAfter a long day at the blackboard, plugging away at the impenetrable math of quantum mechanics or black holes, the mechanical wonders of spaghetti are the perfect fodder for scientists' mealtime probing.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "'Complicated' but 'honest' - Tuchel's path from barman to England boss\nA new era in English football starts on Friday.\nGerman Thomas Tuchel will become the third non-British permanent manager to lead the England side after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.\nUnder Gareth Southgate, the Three Lions reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and lost in the 2021 and 2024 Euros finals.\nFor the 51-year-old Tuchel, who has an 18-month contract, his job brief is clear, but hugely difficult \u2013 to qualify for and then win the 2026 World Cup.\nHe will be looking to make a lightning start as England have two home qualifiers first up \u2013 Albania at Wembley before entertaining Latvia on Monday.\nBut what can they expect from Tuchel, who guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021, and who has also managed Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich?\nBBC Sport has spoken to those who know Tuchel well to find out more.\n'Incredible' Tuchel helped Gibbs-White over England upset\nHas Tuchel's first squad revealed England's short-term strategy?\nPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their say\nThis video can not be played\nFrom bartender to England manager - Rangnick reflects on Tuchel's journey\nTuchel, who stands at 6ft 4in, was a defender during his playing days.\nHe began at second-tier German side Stuttgarter Kickers, before three years at third division team SSV Ulm until a serious knee injury ended his playing career in 1998, when he was 25.\nHis boss at Ulm was Ralf Rangnick, who went on to manage Schalke, RB Leipzig, Manchester United and is now Austria's head coach.\n\"He was always interested in why we were doing certain things,\" said Rangnick. \"After a couple of weeks, you can tell what player could become a coach - he was always asking questions.\"\nIn 2000, a successful coaching career seemed a long way off for Tuchel, who was pulling pints and collecting glasses.\n\"When I became head coach of Stuttgart, I found out he was working in a bar to earn a living, I could hardly believe it,\" added Rangnick.\n\"I called him and said, 'Why don't you come to us and work as a youth team coach?' That's how his coaching career started.\n\"It was clear he shouldn't be working in a bar and would much rather be on a pitch with a team.\"\nThomas Tuchel was managing in the German Bundesliga at the age of 35 with Mainz\nTuchel worked with Stuttgart Under-15s and a few years later would guide their under-19s to their league title.\nHis first managerial role came in 2007 at FC Augsburg II and two years later he was in charge of Bundesliga outfit Mainz, who had Jurgen Klopp among their former bosses.\nRangnick was not surprised Tuchel would manage at the top level and added: \"Thomas is a very bright, intelligent person. He studied sports in Stuttgart. It was obvious he had quite a few assets of what you need as a manager.\"\nTuchel would also learn from, and emulate, those around him.\nIn five years at Mainz, he qualified for Europe twice, guiding them to fifth in 2010-11, their best ever Bundesliga position.\n\"Tuchel is someone who has been influenced by a lot of managers and coaches \u2013 it's clear he has a constant desire to learn, to be open-minded and curious,\" said former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger.\n\"Ralf Rangnick is one of the coaches who has influenced him - what are you doing when you don't have the ball, how do you win it back, then how do you create chances and score goals?\n\"Tuchel took elements of that, but another element is focused on what you do with the ball too.\n\"With that aspect, Tuchel is very close to Pep Guardiola in terms of the way he thinks about football and how to create chances from your own possession.\n\"Pep was more of a coach he looked up to, in the time they spent together in the Bundesliga [when Guardiola was in charge of Bayern Munich] there was a bond, a relationship forged. They are still friends and they talk regularly.\"\nThomas Tuchel was sacked by Borussia Dortmund three days after winning the German Cup\nIn 2015, Tuchel began his next challenge, replacing Liverpool-bound Klopp as boss of Borussia Dortmund.\nDuring Klopp's seven years at Dortmund, he had won the Bundesliga twice and reached the Champions League final, and Tuchel had to win over his new players, with not all of them keen.\n\"I honestly didn't expect much when it was announced he was going to be the new manager. I was even in talks maybe to leave the club,\" recalled former Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan.\n\"I had one phone call with him and he presented himself to me when I was on holiday in the summer break, and it was actually a really good call.\n\"He tried to explain a few things, how he wanted us to play, how he wanted us to train and everything he said he proved during that season.\"\nGundogan joined Manchester City after Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga at the end of that 2015-16 campaign, while Tuchel claimed the first major trophy of his career, beating Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 in the final of the German Cup in May 2017, in what proved to be his last match at the club.\nFormer Germany international Gundogan, though, was completely won over by Tuchel in their sole season together.\n\"I can only say positive things about him from when we were at Dortmund,\" he added. \"He's outstanding tactically and extremely honest and open. Personally, I got along very well with him.\"\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel's man-management skills would be key to success with England and added: \"The players Tuchel has worked with in the past are very positive about him, and the way he communicates his ideas to them.\n\"I don't think the fact he is German will make any difference. Most of the England players work under foreign managers, or have done. He's a top manager so they will be open to his ideas and used to most of them, so it should be a smooth transition.\"\nRangnick added: \"He's somebody who loves to improve people. As a head coach, you need to be analytic and intelligent. He is curious, funny with a good sense of humour. A very specific humour and, if you know the humour, he can be funny.\"\nThomas Tuchel won Uefa Men's Coach of the Year for 2020-21 after guiding Chelsea to the Champions League\nApart from his almost five-year spell at Mainz, all of Tuchel's jobs have followed a similar pattern \u2013 successful, but not in the same role for long.\nAfter Dortmund, he won Ligue 1 twice and took Paris St-Germain to the Champions League final in a two-and-a-half-year spell.\nChelsea came next, getting the job in January 2021 and winning the Champions League just four months later, beating Guardiola and Gundogan's Manchester City side 1-0 in the final.\nHowever, despite also winning the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup, he was sacked in September 2022.\nBefore England, Bayern Munich was his last managerial job in March 2023, and he instantly won the Bundesliga title within a few months, but was gone at the end of the next campaign - a season that ended without any silverware despite the goals of England captain Harry Kane.\nThis video can not be played\n'We have to free ourselves from history' - new England boss Tuchel\n\"Thomas is not an easy person, or easy to deal with, but all good coaches are complicated,\" said Christian Heidel, Mainz's long-time executive and sporting director, in 2021.\n\"Complicated means they are also tough. They make demands of those around them, their players from morning to night and for that reason, they are incredible coaches.\"\nFormer Augsburg youth coach Heiner Schuhmann described Tuchel as \"an outstanding, passionate player on the pitch, who gave his all\", but felt \"he was so exacting and demanding, which didn't go down well with some of the players\".\nHitzlsperger also felt Tuchel could \"rub people up the wrong way\" in his dealings with club officials and would have to try to avoid that happening with the English Football Association.\n\"It's important Tuchel maintains a good relationship with the FA, the people who have brought him in, and he has to handle the media and public,\" said the former Aston Villa and Stuttgart midfielder.\n\"The same thing must not happen that happened in Bayern and Dortmund, where he fell out with his bosses. I am optimistic there won't be too many disagreements, because at his previous clubs it was often about transfers, which as a national team manager is not an issue.\n\"With the media and the fans, it's different. The advantage he has is he has worked in this country before with Chelsea, so knows what English fans are like.\"\nThomas Tuchel's England side have been drawn in World Cup Qualifying Group K, along with Albania, Andorra, Latvia and Serbia\nTuchel started the England job on 1 January and has been regularly spotted at Premier League matches.\nHe has already shown he will do the job his way, handing a surprise recall to 34-year-old Ajax midfielder Jordan Henderson, as well as first international call-ups for 32-year-old Newcastle defender Dan Burn and 18-year-old Arsenal left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly.\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer felt Tuchel would want to get the best out of the team immediately and said: \"We've been down the route so many times of an English manager having this hope, this belief in three or four years' time we might be this.\n\"This manager has been brought in for now, for the next 18 months, to win the World Cup. That's his job. If he doesn't win the World Cup he won't be here.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBrotherhood, Ben White and playing style - Tuchel answers key questions\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel could succeed and his nationality would soon be ignored if England were winning matches.\n\"His experience in club management will help him with England,\" he added. \"He had to deal with some of the biggest names in world football at PSG for example, and was expected to win everything in France and in European competition.\n\"Hopefully the players want to play for their country because they think this is fun, they play good football and enjoy the way they play.\n\"He will get people excited and out of their seats, thinking 'this is great football, this is what we wanted to see'.\"\nThe 2026 World Cup will be held in Canada, the United States and Mexico and Tuchel will be aiming to become only the second manager to guide England to World Cup glory after Sir Alf Ramsey in 1966.\n\"I would never say, 'he is going to win the World Cup', but he has got one of the best squads in the world, along with Spain, France, Argentina, and Brazil,\" said Hitzlsperger.\n\"Tuchel is probably hoping to play Germany at some stage. Can you imagine? Putting one over Germany in a World Cup \u2013 that would be very sweet for him and it probably wouldn't get any bigger.\n\"If he were to put one over them it would be one of the biggest achievements, just after winning the World Cup, and beating Germany on the way would be fantastic for him.\"\nThis video can not be played\nEngland played with fear, we have to change that - Tuchel",

I didn't want to have my back away from the wall as I didn't want anything behind me because I was scared of being knocked. \n\"I barely left my house and I was told not to go in a car so it was all quite scary but thankfully we got past all of that.\"\nMacDonald says she had to learn to trust her body again - but being reunited with her club-mates reminded her why she wanted to return to action.\nWomen's Six Nations team-by-team guide\nVenner's 'rollercoaster ride' back to England squad\nEngland and Bristol Bears centre Reed retires\nShe added: \"I would wake up in the morning and check I could move my feet.

Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.\nVOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.\nBut China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".\n\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.\nHu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"\nSuch responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend.

        "article_text": "To protect crops from rising droughts, scientists are looking to the genes of a small group of plants that can survive months of drought then regreen within hours.\nIt was as a child growing up in South Africa in the 1970s that Jill Farrant first noticed several plants around her apparently coming back from the dead.\nThese plants, she later learned, can survive six months or more without water. Their leaves turn brown and brittle to the touch but, given water, they will regreen within hours. Within a day, they've returned to their former self and can continue to photosynthesise.\nWhile such a Lazarus-like ability is common among mosses, ferns and other non-flowering plants, these \"resurrection plants\" belonged to the angiosperms, or flowering plants, the group that includes every blossoming tree and fruit-bearing, seed-carrying crop. But out of the 352,000 known species of flowering plants only 240 are resurrection plants. Scattered across this branch of the tree of life, they are often unrelated, each having independently evolved the ability to live without water. Primarily found growing on the rocky slopes or gravelly soils of South Africa, Australia and South America, the tactics used for this zombie-like trick are surprisingly similar \u2013 almost as if an ancestral toolkit can be retrieved from deep inside their DNA to deal with the problem of drought.\nFarrant, now a professor of desiccation tolerance at the University of Cape Town, has been studying these unusual plants for over three decades. Along with several other researchers, she believes the drought-resistant powers found in their genes may be key to adapting agriculture to a future of climate change.\nFor plants to survive for months without water may seem like science-fiction. The vast majority of plants do indeed die when they experience water loss of 10-30%. But resurrection plants are able to tolerate over 95% water loss.\nBut it's not just the ability to survive drought that is important for these species, says Carlos Messina, a maize scientist at the University of Florida. It's also how resurrection plants regrow following drought.\nMaize plants might also survive after a drought, he says, \"but when they rehydrate, they don't go back to the same leaf architecture they had before, and the flow of CO2 and water is all messed up\". Drought therefore compromises their growth long after the rains have returned.\nBut resurrection plants \"seem to come back to the form that they had before the drought,\" he says. \"If we can create maize that does that, that's fantastic, because we can regain that productivity.\"\nResurrection plants have evolved this essential skill by replacing disappearing water with sugars such as sucrose, turning the inside of their cells into a viscous, glass-like substance that slows down any chemical reactions. Known as vitrification, the same tactic is used by desiccation-tolerant animals such as tardigrades (also known as water bears) and the eggs of Artemia shrimp (sea monkeys).\nAs they turn to glass, these plants also deconstruct their photosynthetic machinery (such as chloroplasts), switching off their primary source of food as they turn to a state of dormancy. To hold their assembly of proteins and cell membranes together, they secrete a suite of protective proteins known as \"chaperones\", since they guide the cell through dangerous times.\u00a0\n\"How they preserve their tissue is quite a miracle,\" Farrant says.\nIn a sense, the abilities of resurrection plants are not so different to the seeds of most flowering plants. When dried and stored in a dark and cold place, many seeds can survive for years, sometimes millennia, preserving the recipe to make a new plant when warmth and water return.\nHype Metre\nThe fascinating ability of resurrection plants to survive intact without water for months has obvious appeal in a world seeing rising desertification and increasingly erratic drought. If these same traits could be used in crops, it could help maintain food production in areas which are drying up. But altering the genomes of organisms remains controversial in remains in many areas of the world. It's also early days for this research, although genes from resurrection plants have been shown to improve drought tolerance in some food crops.\n\u00a0\nBut once the first green shoot emerges, this \"desiccation tolerance\" is lost, traded for faster growth, high yield and more nutritious fruit or seeds. It's a trait that the green revolution, the 20th Century agriculture boom which introduced high-yielding varieties of crops grown in optimum conditions of water, soil and Sun, exacerbated.\nMeanwhile, while droughts have always been an issue for farmers, rising global temperatures due to ongoing greenhouse gas emissions are making them far worse, especially in the Mediterranean and western North America. Drought, wildfires and heat are estimated to have cost $16.6bn (\u00a312.9m) in crop losses in the US alone in 2023. According to some climate models, by 2100 much of the agricultural land in sub-Saharan Africa and South America will be unsuitable for food production, a large proportion made barren by drought.\n\"Agriculture will only be possible in Canada and Siberia,\" says Henk Hilhorst, a retired seed scientist based in the Netherlands. It is these northerly regions of the planet, not the tropics, that will have to feed the world.\nThe situation is so severe, argues Farrant, that even the most radical shifts in agriculture now have to be considered. \"We're just not going to get enough food,\" she says. \"So we've got to become incredibly inventive.\"\nThe most common crop plants such as wheat, maize and soybean have already been made more resilient to water scarcity through selective breeding. Choosing plants with greater root depth helps them find deeper reserves of water, for example, or choosing those that flower faster helps produce seeds in a shorter growing season.\nBut extreme weather events aren't just becoming more common, they are becoming more unpredictable. Chaos is the marker of climate change, says Timothy George, a soil scientist at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland. \"There's just much more variability.\" Periods without water occurring out of the blue \u2013 known as flash droughts \u2013 are becoming more common, as are droughts that occur during months of the year once guaranteed rain and mild conditions.\u00a0\nThis means that avoiding drought may stop being possible. That's why Farrant and other scientists are investigating whether they can find a way to recreate the remarkable desiccation tolerance of resurrection plants in ordinary food crops.\nTo introduce such talents to rice, maize and wheat was long thought to require the use of \"transgenic\" genetic modification \u2013 introducing DNA into their genome from distant relatives in the plant kingdom. The genes involved in desiccation tolerance would be isolated and inserted into drought-sensitive crops, a task that has been made simpler with the recent rise of Crispr gene editing technologies.\nBut Farrant's recent studies suggest that many of the genes used to survive desiccation are the same as those found in seeds of most flowering plants. To create drought-resistant crops, therefore, might not require any new genes at all; by activating the same genetic toolkit found in their seeds, a mature plant might be made more resilient to drying out. As this would involve activating genes that have simply been silenced upon germination, rather than inserting foreign genes from other plants, it may not be as controversial as some other genetically-modified crops.\nJulia Buitink, a seed biologist at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research in Paris, agrees it's a feasible approach, even if the effect were limited to the young seedlings of the crop. Seedlings could be an easier target, she says, primarily because this stage of growth follows germination, and extending desiccation tolerance would be the most logical first step. Plus, because most desiccation-tolerant organisms are small, these seedlings would fit the mould already found in nature.\u00a0\nStill, while these techniques are feasible in any laboratory in the world, there remain huge gaps in our knowledge when it comes to how these plants survive desiccation, especially when it comes to howeach adaptation is controlled. \"I think we know the main genes,\" says Buitink. \"The problem is the higher level \u2013 how can we switch them on when there is drought? And for that we really don't know much about it.\"\nThe genetic switches that have been identified, Buitink adds, are often not specific to one thing: turn on desiccation tolerance, she says, and you will almost certainly change many other parts of the plant \u2013 and most importantly, may decrease its yield. \"Which, for crops, is exactly what you don't want.\"\nBut if a \"master switch\" \u2013 a gene specific to inducing desiccation tolerance \u2013 can be found, it could be turned on only when water scarcity becomes an issue, ensuring that the yield of these crops would be unaffected if conditions are conducive to growth. Just as a resurrection plant only shrivels into a crinkle of brown leaves during the long dry season, a crop plant might only batten down the hatches when a flash drought comes out of the blue.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The $1m cactus heist that led to a smuggler's downfall\n\u2022 The strangest new species of 2024\n\u2022 The weird biology of the giant smelly 'corpse plant'\nThis is exactly what researchers in Kenya and Sweden achieved in 2018 when they introduced a single gene from Xerophyta viscosa \u2013 a resurrection plant also known as the small black-stick lily \u2013 into a variety of sweet potato. Known to be important in antioxidant defence, the gene, known as XvAld1, made these transgenic potato plants more resilient to a 12-day dehydration experiment. Compared to their wild-type neighbours, they remained greener for longer, lost fewer leaves, and grew taller even when deprived of water. Importantly, they were indistinguishable before the dehydration experiment began, suggesting the gene had no impact on growth or leaf structure.\nGenes from resurrection plants have been shown to improve drought tolerance in other plants too, including the lab favourite Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco plants. Still, with genetically-modified crops of any kind still required to fit stringent legal check-lists (particularly in the EU), Farrant has started to look for other ways to induce these remarkable traits of resurrection plants into crops grown today.\nJust as the microbiome is a hot topic in human health, the root microbiome (or rhizosphere) is gaining interest in agricultural science. Drought tolerance might not be just in the leaves and stems, but in the roots. \"This is where there might be [potential] for groups like resurrection plants or other extreme species,\" says George. \"If there's a microbiome element to their ability to cope with extreme stress, then you might be able to transfer that into a cropping system much more easily than, say, genetic components.\"\nAnd this is exactly what Farrant is trying to do. Along with her colleagues Shandry Tebele and Rose Marks, she has begun to map the microbiome of the Myrothamnus flabellifolia, a species that is unique even among resurrection plants. Growing in gravelly soil in South Africa, it can grow to waist-height and is more like a bush than a lonely patch of grass. Even with such complexity and size, it can survive for nine months or more without water.\nThe researchers first survey of M. flabellifolia's rhizosphere, published in 2024, revealed over 900 unique bacterial and fungal groups, the beginning of what might become a drought-tolerant probiotic that can be used for other plants.\u00a0\nAboveground, though, it is Farrant's work on teff that may be most auspicious. A naturally gluten-free cereal, teff has been grown for thousands of years in Ethiopia. Its tolerance to water scarcity has long led to it being lauded as a potential more sustainable and climate-resilient crop, but Farrant is interested in this species for slightly different reasons. Teff is the only crop that has a resurrection plant as a close relative: Eragrostis nindensis, a waist-height grass that grows on rocky slopes across southern Africa. Learning how these plants differ in their responses to drought might reveal which genes have been lost or switched off \u2013 and whether these can be reinserted back into teff, a genetic modification that is more likely to be successful given their close relationship.\nIt's a work still in its infancy. But already it seems that protection against sunlight is one of the main differences between the two. E. nindensi produces antioxidants inside its leaves and a coating of anthocyanins \u2013 essentially a plant's version of sun cream \u2013 on its external surfaces. Teff doesn't have this ability. It's a delicate balance for E. nindensi to pull off: sunlight is essential for a water-filled plant to grow, but during drought it can be lethal, leading to uncontrolled photosynthesis, the production of reactive oxygen species, and damage from UV radiation. For teff to have this option, however, might allow it to survive the harshest drought and grow another day.\nSo the tiny seeds of teff, milled to make flour for bread and pancakes, might just hold the key to a more sustainable agriculture. Just as maize, rice and wheat were bred for higher yields at the expense of resilience in the 20th Century's Green Revolution, such crops would add resilience, even if at the cost of a slightly lower yield. \"They might have a low yield but the subsistence farmer has a crop,\" Farrant. \"This is regardless of whether it rains in 10 days or two years.\"\n* Alex Riley is science writer and author of\u00a0Super Natural: How Life Thrives in Impossible Places.

The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added when the power outage happened the back up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nPassengers were urged not to travel to the airport unless their airline had advised them to do so on Friday.\nThe airport is hoping to run a normal service on Saturday, Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye said.\nThe travel disruption affected many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nThe National Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.\nIn the meantime, customers have been told not to go to the airport unless their airline has advised them to.\nBut Mr Woldbye said the airport would be \"back in full operation\" on Saturday.",

Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir gave birth to their son when they were both a year older. \nRUV report that the relationship was secret, but that \u00c1smundsson was present at his child's birth and spent the first year with him. \nHowever, the news agency writes this changed when Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir met her current husband. \nThey report they have seen documents \u00c1smundsson submitted to Iceland's justice ministry requesting access to his son, but that Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir denied it, while also requesting - and receiving - child support payments from him over the following 18 years.\nA relative of \u00c1smundsson tried twice to contact the Icelandic prime minister about the relationship last week. \nFrostad\u00f3ttir said last night that when the woman revealed it involved a government minister she asked for more information, which led to the revelation and the resignation. \nIn her TV interview with RUV last night, Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir said she was upset that the woman had contacted the prime minister. \n\"I understand... what it looks like,\" she said, adding that it is \"very difficult to get the right story across in the news today\". \nWhile the age of consent in Iceland is 15, it is illegal to have sex with a person under the age of 18 if you are their teacher or mentor, if they are financially dependent on you, or work for you. The maximum sentence for this crime is three years in jail. \nDespite resigning from her ministerial job, Th\u00f3rsdottir said she had no plans to leave parliament. ",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight is yet to confirm whether she will remain as England captain\nJon Lewis is not the first England coach or captain to fall victim to the ruthless scrutiny that follows a heavy Ashes defeat, and he certainly will not be the last.\nThe series, which ended in February with a 16-0 thrashing, saw England's women placed under a microscope of pressure, criticism and attention like never before. \nMuch of that came down to England's below-par, and often meek, performances, but a considerable amount was also down to their attitude and the perception they displayed to their fans and the media. \nSince his appointment in November 2022, Lewis has been the driver of England's external messaging, constantly preaching about aggression, fearlessness and entertainment.  \nThe peak of his tenure came in the summer of 2023, when Heather Knight's side fought back from 6-0 down in the home Ashes to draw 8-8. It was a series that had record crowds in grounds including Edgbaston, Lord's and The Oval and showed England were capable of competing with, and beating, the world's best. \nBut after two T20 disappointments in 2023 and 2024 and an away Ashes humiliation, endless talk of processes and style was wearing thin with England followers - they just wanted to win something meaningful, something that has not been achieved since the 50-over World Cup win at Lord's in 2017. \nThe next global tournament is approaching in India at the end of the summer, which will be the first major assignment for England's next coach. \nBefore then, home series against West Indies and India, where there will be plenty for the side and the management to learn and put right from Lewis' tenure.\nEngland sack coach Lewis after Ashes humiliation\nFormer captain Edwards wants to help England rebuild\nAussies offer solutions to England's 'fundamental weaknesses'\nDespite the cloud of negativity under which he has departed, Lewis' record as coach is solid, with a win percentage of 71% across all formats. \nBut the biggest learning curve for England from the Ashes and Lewis' era is that winning bilateral series, with all due respect to the opposition, do not count for much. \nThe home summer of 2024 which saw dominant clean sweeps against Pakistan and New Zealand was quickly forgotten when England crashed out of the T20 World Cup in the group stage following a shambolic display against West Indies. \nThe comprehensive series win in South Africa in December meant little when they were outplayed on every occasion in Australia less than a month later.\nUnder Lewis, England have shown what they are capable of at times, most notably during that memorable home Ashes, but they have also shown far too often that they cannot do it when it counts. \nAfter the humbling at the beginning of the year, the managing director of England women's cricket Clare Connor repeated Lewis' common statement that their side is not put under pressure frequently enough outside of Ashes series and World Cups - but that is a difficult excuse to stand up when Australia, so far ahead of the rest of the world, seem to manage pretty well. \nEngland will once again be expected to dominate this upcoming home summer, but the World Cup in India presents an enormous challenge in terms of the conditions and the physical toll it could take. \nThey may not be favourites - Australia always are, and India will be confident on home soil - but over the past two years England have been unable to get past the semi-final stage and for the team ranked second in the world that is unacceptable.\nFor the new coach, and potentially new captain - Knight's future is still uncertain - it is a difficult challenge but one that could go a long way in winning back some fans, but they cannot afford another case of deja vu. \nConnor also acknowledged that the team's reputation had taken a hit, but refuted claims of \"cosiness\" or a lack of professionalism. \nBut honesty will go a long way in winning back fans for England, and the new coach cannot fix a problem unless they accept there is one. \nSophie Ecclestone's refusal to do a pre-match interview with Channel 7 pundit and former England spinner Alex Hartley gave England more unwanted headlines, and while Connor admitted it was an \"unfortunate incident\" that would not be repeated, it threw the team's perception and attitude into the limelight, giving the impression of a culture which enabled one of its best players to make such an unprofessional call with little consequence.\nLewis and Knight started to lose credibility with the repeated claims of being \"so close\" to beating Australia after the first few defeats, leaving fans and the media wondering whether we had all been watching different games. \nIt was also left to Knight and others to front up to the press after each crushing defeat, each one becoming more awkward and painful, with Lewis waiting until the third T20 in Adelaide - with the series already gone - until he eventually stepped forward. \nFrom that came his infamous quote about the \"Bondi to Coogee\" walk which suggested that Australia's climate and outdoor lifestyle was a factor in their athleticism being so superior to England's. \nNaturally, as with all woeful Ashes tours, the Australian media needed no encouragement to latch on to an opportunity for mocking and it felt like a turning point for Lewis' reign and that it would be very difficult for him and the team to recover.\nECB boss 'can't believe' 16-0 Women's Ashes loss\nThis video can not be played\n'Goodness me!' - England drop seven catches\nSo, just how can the new coach avoid the same mistakes on the field, too?\nThe review into the Ashes defeat is yet to be published but in terms of their on-field performances, England need to concentrate on going back to basics. \nThey were largely dominated by Australia, but there were also multiple instances of England gifting them opportunities to win - consider the inability to chase 181 in the second one-day international at Melbourne's Junction Oval, or the embarrassing second day of the Test match which saw seven dropped catches. \nThe team's fielding in general should be very high, if not top, of the new coach's to-do list - it is a huge area for improvement where England have faltered under Lewis, with drops also costing them in the T20 World Cup. \nSimilarly is their ability to play spin, and with a World Cup in India approaching, they have less time to rectify this weakness but it should be a non-negotiable. \nDuring the Ashes, they lost 40 wickets to spin at an average of 12.3 and a strike-rate of just 53.7. \nAgain, it is time to forget Lewis' talk of aggression and expressing yourself - it is clearly not working. The batters evidently need direction in this regard; they need to adopt clear, individual plans against slower bowling before being left to their own devices. \nIf Lewis' reign was all about freedom and flexibility, it is possible that - or at least until these basics are done right - an element of structure and discipline would not do England any harm. \nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",
