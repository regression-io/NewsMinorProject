        "article_text": "Video games are the biggest form of entertainment in the world, but sometimes they bleed into people's lives offline in surprising and disturbing ways.\nChristian Dines' hands were twitching. As though he were still gripping his video game controller, about to make a killer move. But the game was switched off and his hands were free. The US-based sustainability advisor had also noticed how, when he glanced at objects in his room, he felt an urge to absorb or \"collect\" them, like weapons or power-ups in his game.\nHe swallowed hard. \"I thought, 'what the hell is this?' It was something I'd never experienced before as a gamer,\" he says. After a week of playing the same game maybe two or three hours a day, Dines' virtual experience was spilling over, disturbingly, into reality.\u00a0\n\"It all only lasted a couple of days, but the effect was disorientating,\" he recalls. \"It's unnerving to be distracted in some way by a screen when you're no longer in front of it.\"\nDines had, it seems, experienced something called Game Transfer Phenomenon, a condition in which the physical world and video games bleed together. While this might not be very common, for gamers who experience it, the condition can be extremely unsettling. And potentially even dangerous.\nThe term Game Transfer Phenomenon, or GTP, was first coined by Angelica Ortiz de Gortari, a psychologist at the University of Bergen in Norway. She first proposed the concept a decade ago while working on her doctoral thesis under the supervision of Mark Griffiths, head of Nottingham Trent University's International Gaming Research Unit. Ortiz de Gortari was motivated by her own experience of GTP. One day, she was walking around her local supermarket and realised that she was imagining peering at products on the shelves through a rifle scope.\n\"I thought, 'Wow! This is interesting',\" she recalls. \"A phenomenon that changes your perception by encouraging you to see objects through the lens of the game you're playing,\" she says, adding that her response had felt involuntary, leaving her with serious questions about what it meant.\nBut what exactly is GTP? Ortiz de Gortari suggests that one could compare it to potentially more common experiences such as ear-worms, in which you spend days trying to get a catchy song out of your head. Or when images from a television show you binge-watched keep popping up in your mind's eye. With GTP, though, the intensity is arguably dialled up, says Ortiz de Gortari. Not least because gaming activates brain areas associated with control inhibition \u2013 the ability, or not, to control one's thoughts and behaviour rather than acting on impulse. This can also occur while passively watching television, but to a lesser degree than while gaming.\nOrtiz de Gortari's studies suggest that GTP induces distress and dysfunction for around half of those gamers who say they have experienced it, with confusion, hyper-vigilance and irrationality among the symptoms. For others the only notable response may be a feeling of embarrassment that their game-play has spilled over into \"real life\".\nOne study participant she interviewed reported seeing health indicator bars like those in the role-playing game World of Warcraft floating above their companions' heads. Another spoke of lapses in concentration after not being able to stop \"seeing\" images from a game. Others said colours in the real world seemed transformed, and began to mimic the colours of a game world they had recently played in. While such effects are usually transitory, GTP can provoke a startling array of spontaneous or involuntary effects, according to Ortiz de Gortari's research.\nWhile rare, these effects can even take the form of involuntary physical actions and behaviours. A game could end up shaping the way one interacts with real world objects or people. For example, a walk down a supermarket aisle could be experienced through the lens of gameplay, with the player perhaps \"shooting\" at products or people, possibly with a corresponding involuntary physical action in the hands as though working console controls.\nIn total, Ortiz de Gortari has recorded GTP experiences among gamers related to more than 400 titles of all kinds. Her largest on the subject to date, published in 2024, involved the participation of 623 Chinese gamers, both male and female. The results suggest that between 82% and 96% of those gamers have experienced some form of GTP.\u00a0\nIt's possible that some gamers might have endured episodes of GTP but never admitted this to anyone, for fear of being considered \"crazy\", says Ortiz de Gortari. It is time we demystified GTP, she argues. \"The mission for me is to inform people about the phenomenon, to raise awareness, because the [gamers] I've spoken to about it have been very concerned,\" she says. \"Often, people don't want to talk about the experience of, say, seeing things that aren't there with their open eyes \u2013 even if that's what happens \u2013 because that's to talk about hallucinations, and they're associated with [potentially taboo, severe] mental illness.\"\nOrtiz de Gortari argues that GTP has become a more common experience as games, especially role-playing, simulation, adventure and first-person shooter games, have become increasingly realistic and immersive. They offer sprawling environments full of detail and interaction. Essentially, gamers end up living virtual lives through such media and can find the gameplay deeply affecting.\n\"The more realistic the video game world is, the more likely players are to confuse the game world and the real world,\" says Ortiz de Gortari, who adds that this could mean GTP is becoming more common and impactful. The sophistication of games has undoubtedly increased since the days of Tetris and Super Mario, she points out. \"Essentially the sophistication of the game facilitates the experience outside of the game.\"\nAli Farha, a gaming industry commentator and senior game producer at Stockholm-based Star Stable Entertainment, has experienced GTP himself. He describes his case as \"a pretty harmless sense of gameplay repeating offline\". He suggests that regular breaks during extended stretches of play and a period of conscious decompression after a long gaming session \u2013 reading a book or watching some light TV \u2013 could help counteract the likelihood of GTP raising its head.\nPlaying time \u2013 particularly above four hours \u2013 does appear to be a key factor in the onset of GTP. That's one reason why Scott Jennings, spokesperson for the US-based Gaming Addicts Anonymous (GAA), whose members invariably are at the high-end of playing hours, says the support group is increasingly mindful of this potential side-effect of gaming.\u00a0\nFarha also says that few people currently appreciate that, as he believes, the bridge between the real and the virtual is actually a two-way street.\u00a0\n\"We overlook that we also take the experiences and expectations of the real world into the game world \u2013 and that too can be disorientating,\" he says. \"I think it's quite common to enter a multi-player online game and feel loneliness, for example, even though you know you're at home. The experiences we have online become part of our personality. We build memories inside the virtual space of the games we play too, in the same way we build memories in the real world.\" In fact, studies suggest that games can be more conducive to memory formation than real life.\n\"I think for a lot of players the virtual and real worlds are starting to blur,\" Farha adds.\nWhile no-one has reported physical harm as a consequence of GTP to date reported to date \u2013 GTP could, in principle, endanger someone. \"It's not a good idea for me to be trying to kill demons while I'm driving,\" as Dines puts it.\nExactly why the virtual world can blur with the real world in this way, however, is still not clear. Some studies suggest different brain networks are activated when observing something in a virtual environment, compared to a real one. The same has been found with objects in augmented reality, where virtual elements are superimposed onto the real world. But some studies have shown that human memory can sometimes struggle to recall whether something occurred in a virtual environment or in real life \u2013 with the effects being more pronounced when using virtual reality systems.\nOrtiz de Gortari has indicated that GTP might be more common among gamers who have a tendency for mind-wandering and have a low working memory capacity. She also believes it could be the result of the game priming the brain or some sort of associated learning effect that when gamers encounter something similar to an environment or scene they came across in a game, it can trigger an involuntary response.\nBut these are all theories for now.\n\"The human brain isn't built to differentiate between reality and today's virtual worlds,\" says a spokesperson for Game Addicts Anonymous. \"That's one reason why games are so captivating and why it's no surprise the two experiences overlap.\"\nJennings also recounts a GTP-like experience. After playing an aggressive racing game he later felt \"a disconcerting urge\" when out driving, to smash into a vehicle that pulled up alongside him. He argues that GTP could be compared to alcoholism. It's not necessarily about how many drinks you've had but rather it's about your personal relationship to alcohol. Similarly, he says, while most people may have a functional relationship to gaming, some players are less able to contain its effect to playing time.\nRecent research by Ortiz de Gortari would appear to back this up. Her findings suggests that certain personality traits are likely a factor in one's propensity towards GTP. Other influences she cites include suffering from sleep deprivation, stress, depression or anxiety.\nMax Dzmitryiev, a US-based counsellor and gamer, says he grew up experiencing symptoms of anxiety. Video games, he says, offered an escape from reality.\u00a0\n\"But I'd easily get immersed in them,\" he recalls. \"And as the level of immersion grew, so the stimulation was higher and so I had more GTP experiences,\" he says. To him, GTP is \"freaky and unpleasant\" and something that can overwhelm his thoughts and decisions for as long as 20 minutes. After such a bout, GTP can keep popping up for days, intermittently, he explains.\nDzmitryiev has even noticed that watching someone else play a game can induce GTP-style effects. He gives the example of observing someone having fun in Minecraft, a colourful exploration and world-building game. Watching the other person's progress intently can lead to Dzmitryiev to, he says, literally perceiving his own surroundings as though they were built from the cube-like blocks used to construct the virtual environments in Minecraft. This effect \u2013 like an involuntary visual overlay to his surroundings \u2013 can last for an hour or so, he says. \"It's why I tend to stay away from VR games now \u2013 because I still feel fully immersed for too long after taking the headset off,\" he says.\nIt raises questions about whether the games industry should be addressing GTP in some way? Since so many games are played by children and young people, Ortiz de Ortiz de Gortari argues that developers should take more responsibility in addressing the potential impact of GTP on susceptible gamers, possibly through their own research, or at least by acknowledging its effects.\nDines says that he would endorse some kind of warning on games. It may only have relevance for a few gamers but that's no different to the warnings about strobe lighting effects, which could induce epileptic seizures in a small subset of players, for example.\n\"Game developers intentionally craft their products to give certain experiences \u2013 they know their game's power,\" says Farha. \"Players need to appreciate that games have to be used correctly. I know I've played too much at times and it didn't make me feel good.\"\nBut Nick Ballou, a postdocoral researcher in video games and mental health at the University of Oxford, expresses concern that overemphasising the dangers of GTP will fuel the moral panic around video games or stoke fears that all games are inherently unhealthy. Ballou is currently in the process of analysing data shared with him by the gaming industry. This data covers five leading video game platforms and his goal is to provide the most nuanced picture to date of how games affect people, both for better or worse. He aims to publish the first research from this project this spring.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why children love Minecraft so much\n\u2022 The mysterious origins of an uncrackable video game\n\u2022 The people who 'see' foreign languages\nMost gamers don't find that their hobby impacts their mental health negatively, he says. Rather, they more commonly report that gaming induces feelings of relief or relaxation, and that it gives them access to communities or offers a sense of achievement and identity. \"Any problems are at the extremes [of gaming],\" says Ballou. \"[Similarly], in small doses, GTP doesn't strike me as particularly problematic. If it was endemic we'd see more people out there behaving in very strange ways. But we don't.\"\nFor Ortiz de Gortari, however, there's a lot still to uncover about this extraordinary phenomenon. We still know relatively little about the way gamers unconsciously process what they see and hear during play. A better understanding of this, through a complex and expensive brain scan study, might, she says, help us unravel what happens as GTP kicks in.\u00a0\n\"We have enough evidence that GTP is happening,\" she says. \"Now we need to more about know how and why.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The more realistic the video game world is, the more likely players are to confuse the game world and the real world \u2013 Angelica Ortiz de GortariIt's possible that some gamers might have endured episodes of GTP but never admitted this to anyone, for fear of being considered \"crazy\", says Ortiz de Gortari.

        "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.\nBut now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.\nThe White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \n\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.\nThat framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. \nSo was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?\nIt didn't take long for Trump's aides \u2013 many of the same people who said he would never back down \u2013 to fan out and celebrate the president's move.\nTrade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\".\n\"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\"\nThey were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?\nUltimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.\nEarlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. \nIn the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.\nHe insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".\n\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.\nIn the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. \nThe reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. \nIt is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.\nThat will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions.\nThe big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week \u2013 setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order \u2013 will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. \nAnd in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.\nWhile much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.\nThis is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't find Rome or London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finally found its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's caused tourism upheaval \u2013 and rows with locals \u2013 in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.\nThese are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.\nPuglia saw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays \u2013 still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.\n\"The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authentic masserie\u00a0(farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,\" says California-based travel advisor and photographer Coco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. \"The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites like Alberobello make it exceptional,\" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience the Jubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events in Rome.\nTran recommends booking a table at cliff-side Osteria Sant'Anna in Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter through Lecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran says Masseria Torre Coccaro remains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves \u2013 plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.\u00a0\nBest time to visit: Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.\nPortugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation than Porto and Lisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is the Alentejo coast, which experienced its best tourism year on record in 2024.\n\"Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,\" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey \u2013 especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.\nWho picked the list?\nStacey Leasca is an award-winning travel journalist living in Lisbon, Portugal, with two decades of experience covering destinations across Europe and beyond. She served as adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Southern California and is a PhD candidate specialising in building resiliency to disinformation in journalism.\u00a0\nThe area's \"mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe\" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price of\u00a0ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.\n\u00c9vora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famed\u00a0Festas dos Santos Populares\u00a0(Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself at\u00a0Craveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm \u2013 including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.\nBest time to visit:\u00a0Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through the\u00a0Fisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.\u00a0\nAbout five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier \u2013 both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks \u2013 specifically, Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (\u00a389.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.\nHowever, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride the Glacier Express train through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel \u2013 including a seemingly endless supply of fondue \u2013 and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxurious Chedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for the Post Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.\nBest time to visit: Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.\nCap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the C\u00f4ted'Azur \u2013 an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy \u2013 and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.\nThe iconic Belles Rives hotel \u2013 Fitzgerald's home for part of the 1920s \u2013 is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. \"The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,\" says Andria Mitsakos, founder of AMPR, which represents the property.\nBeyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts the Juan-les-Pins International Jazz Festival in July, when Bastille Day celebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend the Festival International d'Art Sacr\u00e9, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as the Picasso Museum and the Chapelle Matisse.\nBest time to visit: The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.\nWhile Italy continues to grapple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery, cultural depth and fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named a European Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.\nAt just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a \"small but mighty country\", says James Montie, branch manager at Fox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, \"from Lake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave\", are a primary draw, he adds.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n\u2022 Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n\u2022 Here's how to safely visit glacier sites around the world\nIndependent travel advisor Kimberly Denison agrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds \"Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,\" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that 60% of the country's surface area is forest and it was certified as the world's first green destination in 2016.\nTo explore its glorious landscapes, hike Triglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting at Vila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.\nBest time to visit: The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.\nThe Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine \u2013 specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.\nOf the Peloponnese's three peninsulas, Mani \u2013 the rugged middle finger \u2013 stands out. \"Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani is Greece's best-kept secret,\" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. \"This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance.\" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with \"a deep-rooted history\", she adds. Stay at Pirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century tower\u00a0turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.\nElsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.\nBest time to visit: Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.\nParis had quite the 2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever; since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for the banlieues (suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.\nWhat parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel at Goway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. \"Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,\" he explains, \"but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture \u2013 there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too.\" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks to Notre Dame reopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classic H\u00f4tel du Savoir, formerly called the H\u00f4tel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and is, let's just say, tr\u00e9s chic.\nBest time to visit: Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.\nTourism to Sweden has surged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the \"coolcation\" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.\nWhile many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think granite islands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light \u2013 minus the crowds and queues of the capital.\nIt's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, with Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded the EU's Mission Label for its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in at Hotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, the Bohusl\u00e4n archipelago beckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.\nBest time to visit: June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.\nAlbania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record 11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest in lesser-known Mediterranean escapes \u2013 which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.\n\"Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,\" says Denison. \"The Unesco-listed town of Gjirokast\u00ebr, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.\"\nNew infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including the Green Coast Hotel near the Unesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. \"Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,\" Denison adds.\nWhile hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, the Accursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays like La Brisa Boutique Hotel in Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the new Marriott in the Vlora Marina (expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.\nBest time to visit: The summer months are prime time in Albania \u2013 and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.\nWant to explore even further?

Is it the criticising of Israel and the USA of the slaughter in Gaza?

        "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.\nBut now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.\nThe White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \n\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.\nThat framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. \nSo was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?\nIt didn't take long for Trump's aides \u2013 many of the same people who said he would never back down \u2013 to fan out and celebrate the president's move.\nTrade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\".\n\"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\"\nThey were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?\nUltimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.\nEarlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. \nIn the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.\nHe insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".\n\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.\nIn the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. \nThe reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. \nIt is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.\nThat will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions.\nThe big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week \u2013 setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order \u2013 will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. \nAnd in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "President Trump has been justifying his sweeping tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\".\nHe has imposed tariffs - or import taxes - on countries around the world, including a 125% rate on goods imported from China. In response, China is hiking its tariffs on American imports. \nSome of Trump's claims on trade are unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\n\"We're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\", Trump has said about his new tariff regime on Tuesday. \nBBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 7 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $215m (\u00a3168m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based it on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs (as of 2 April) is 22%. \nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level. \nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April. \nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day. \nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. \nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported. \nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. \nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\". \n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said. \nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false. \nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false. \nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA.  \nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

Donald Trump often suggests that tariffs are a good thing, not merely as a means to an end, but as an end in themselves.He talks about the benefit of a protectionist barrier for America, in order to stimulate domestic investment, encourage American companies to bring those foreign supply chains back home, and raise tax revenues.And if Beijing believes that is indeed the primary purpose of the tariffs, it may decide there is nothing to negotiate anyway.Rather than championing the idea of economic co-operation, the world's two biggest superpowers may find themselves locked in a fight for winner-takes-all economic supremacy.If so, that really would mark a shattering of the old consensus, and a very different, possibly very dangerous, future.Watch: China tariffs 'not good' for the economy - US shoppersXi JinpingTrump tariffsChinaDonald TrumpUnited States",

That is when there is expectation to win. That is when the fans are on you. There are 20 minutes to go, it's 0-0 or you are getting beaten. The pressure is heaped on you. Have you got it in you to stand up and be counted?\nThat is what makes or breaks a Rangers player. And, in this squad, there are not enough players with the mentality to get through those periods. That for me is where this squad is at - and that is the aspect that has let them down.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\nThis video can not be played\nSaturday's loss to Hibernian set an unwanted Rangers record of five straight home defeats\nThat is separate to the technical attributes of these players, though. They are good footballers. They have shown that in European games. They have shown that against Celtic. \nIt was only last month they knocked Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce out of the Europa League and went to Celtic Park and won for the first time in years.\nBut those games bring a different pressure. They bring a different expectation. Going into big European games, especially in the knockout rounds, rarely is there expectancy on Rangers to win.\nMeanwhile, domestically, they simply need to win, win, win. Their tempo needs to be high. They need to commit more bodies forward. \nHow many times have you watched a Rangers game where their two centre-halves are in the attacking half against one striker? That is because, in basic terms, they have to commit more in an attacking sense.\nBut you are at risk if you lose the ball. Just look at Hibernian's second goal on Saturday. It comes from a point where Rangers' defensive-minded players are in Hibs' half.\nIn Europe, you will rarely see that situation with a Rangers team, because they have more focus on the defensive side of their game.\nThe easier thing to do in football is be a defensive team. That is what I think this Rangers team are more comfortable doing. They feel more at ease playing in a defensively organised team that can then counter-attack. \nWhy is it easier? Well, in those moments, you are not coaching a set pattern to break a team down. When that is your gameplan, inevitably when you get possession, the opposition are not set up to be broken down. \nThese Rangers players are intelligent footballers. They get the gameplan of stopping the opposition and being clinical on the counter. They have shown that under Barry Ferguson away to Fenerbahce and Celtic playing in a 3-4-3 set-up.\nIn those games, when Rangers have won the ball, they have been in positions to score goals because even when they are sitting deep in a defensive formation, they always have three attackers forward.\nDefensively, they have more players deeper in the pitch and enough bodies to defend. And, in the attacking sense, having one striker and two number 10s means it is not just Cyriel Dessers or Vaclav Cerny running forward themselves.\nRangers' average player positions in last month's 3-1 win at Fenerbahce (left) and Saturday's defeat at home to Hibs (right) show a stark contrast between where their defensive line typically sits in European and domestic games\nThat approach did not work so well in the home leg against Fenerbahce, or the first half of their league game at Dundee, when they were perhaps expected to take the game to the opposition.\nBut for Thursday's encounter with Athletic Bilbao, I feel the first leg being at home should suit Rangers.\nMost European games that are two-legged affairs, particular in the latter stages of competitions, the first leg is always more cagey. It will probably be accepted a bit more by the Ibrox crowd if Rangers are a bit more solid. \nRangers would bite your hand off to go into that second leg in Bilbao at 0-0. But, make no mistake about it, this will be their toughest European game to date this season. \nThey are going to face a seriously technical team who are fourth in Spain's top flight. They have a top, top coach like Ernesto Valverde - a two-time La Liga winner as Barcelona boss - and they play with good tempo in their approach. \nThat is their model and how they play, so expect their set-up behind the ball to be really good if counter-attack opportunities arise for Rangers.\nThere is no getting away from how big a task this is for Ferguson and his unpredictable players, but that is not to say they cannot hurt them - they can.\nFormer Rangers striker Steven Naismith was speaking to BBC Sport Scotland's Nick McPheat",

        "article_text": "US envoy Steve Witkoff met Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday, as Donald Trump urged the Russian president to \"get moving\" on a ceasefire in Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin said the meeting lasted for more than four hours and focused on \"aspects of a Ukrainian settlement\". The talks, Witkoff's third with Putin this year, were described by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev as \"productive\".  \nTrump has expressed frustration with Putin over the state of talks. On Friday, he wrote on social media: \"Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war.\" \nIt comes as Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg denied suggesting the country could be partitioned.\nThe Times said that, during an interview with the paper, Kellogg had proposed British and French troops could adopt zones of control in the west of Ukraine as part of a \"reassurance force\".\nRussia's army, he reportedly suggested, could then remain in the occupied east. \"You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two\", the paper quoted him as saying.\nKellogg later took to social media to say the article had \"misrepresented\" what he said. \"I was speaking of a post-ceasefire resiliency force in support of Ukraine's sovereignty,\" he wrote on X, adding: \"I was NOT referring to a partitioning of Ukraine.\"\nNeither the White House nor Kyiv reacted to the comments immediately. The BBC has asked the Times for its response.\nEarlier on Friday, European nations agreed \u20ac21bn ($24bn; \u00a318bn) in military aid for Kyiv.\nAt the event, Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war.\nAhead of the Putin-Witkoff talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was \"no need to expect breakthroughs\" as the \"process of normalising relations is ongoing\".\nAsked whether discussions could include setting up a date for Putin and Trump to meet, Peskov said: \"Let's see. It depends on what Witkoff has come with.\"\nBeforehand, Witkoff had a meeting with Dmitriev at the Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg, where a conference was held on stainless steel and the Russian market. \nDmitriev, the 49-year-old head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, visited Washington last week and was the most senior Russian official to go to the US since the country's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nMeanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war during a visit on Friday to the site of a 4 April Russian missile attack on his home town of Kryvyi Rih. The attack killed 19 people, including nine children.\nHe also alleged that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting with the Russian army. It comes after Ukraine said it had captured two Chinese nationals.\n\"We have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia's occupation forces,\" Zelensky said.\n\"This means Russia is clearly trying to prolong the war even by using Chinese lives.\"\nZelensky laid flowers in front of photos of Herman Tripolets, nine, and seven-year-olds Arina Samodina and Radyslav Yatsko.\nHe later reiterated a call for air defence systems \"to protect lives and our cities\".\n\"We discussed this with President Trump - Ukraine is not just asking, we're ready to purchase these additional systems,\" he wrote on social media.\n\"Only powerful weapons can truly be relied upon to protect life when you have a neighbour like Russia.\"\nTrump has previously claimed he could end the Ukraine-Russia conflict \"in 24 hours\". On Friday, he declared that it would not have happened at all if he'd been in the White House in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\"A war that should ld [sic] have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!,\" he wrote.\nIn February US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first face-to-face talks since the invasion. Officials have also been meeting to discuss restoring full diplomatic relations.\nTrump has also had a fractious relationship with Zelensky since his second term as US president began, culminating in an angry confrontation in the Oval Office in February.\nThe US attempted to broker a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, only for it to stall when the Kremlin asked for sanctions imposed after it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour to be lifted.\nTrump has since said he is \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" with Putin over the lack of progress in agreeing a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.\nRussia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the US is not its ally.\nHe said America and Russia had not been able to go from \"total distrust to alignment in two months\" since Trump returned to the White House.\n\"We have too many disagreements,\" he said. \"But we are working on these disagreements step by step in different areas.\"\nEarlier this week, Washington and Moscow went ahead with a prisoner swap. \nKsenia Karelina, a Russian-American, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in Russia for donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity when the war began in February 2022.     \nThe Los Angeles resident was freed on Thursday morning and exchanged for Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in Cyprus in 2023. \nHe was accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Russia for manufacturers working with the military.",

Dmitriev, the 49-year-old head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, visited Washington last week and was the most senior Russian official to go to the US since the country's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Meanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war during a visit on Friday to the site of a 4 April Russian missile attack on his home town of Kryvyi Rih. Officials have also been meeting to discuss restoring full diplomatic relations.Trump has also had a fractious relationship with Zelensky since his second term as US president began, culminating in an angry confrontation in the Oval Office in February.The US attempted to broker a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, only for it to stall when the Kremlin asked for sanctions imposed after it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour to be lifted.Trump has since said he is \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" with Putin over the lack of progress in agreeing a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and TrumpRussia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the US is not its ally.He said America and Russia had not been able to go from \"total distrust to alignment in two months\" since Trump returned to the White House. On Friday, he declared that it would not have happened at all if he'd been in the White House in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. It comes after Ukraine said it had captured two Chinese nationals.",

We've got so much to be proud of.\"\nUniversal's Orlando resort in Florida brought in 9.75 million visitors in 2023, while its Hollywood resort saw 9.66 million the same year - according to the Theme Index Report.\nIn 2016, NBCUniversal agreed to a seven-year deal with Warner Bros. That meant it had television rights to show the Harry Potter films and the Fantastic Beasts franchise.\nThe prime minister said the theme park would create jobs across construction, artificial intelligence and tourism.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said the government had agreed with Universal that British steel would be used \"where possible\" on the project.\n\"That's the case with HS2, with Heathrow, and with this private investment here in Bedfordshire,\" she said.\nAccording to plans from Universal Destinations & Experiences, the UK site would include a theme park, a 500-room hotel and a retail complex.\nUniversal has already bought 476 acres for the project, but could buy more land to increase the plot to about 700 acres - which would improve transport links.\nResidents living in surrounding villages have responded positively to the plans, though some are concerned infrastructure will not be enough to support the amount of expected visitors.\nUniversal said it had surveyed more than 6,000 local people and organisations, and 92% of those supported the project.\nUniversal said it would make upgrades to the Wixams railway station and build a new station on the East West Rail line near the resort.\nIt would also add dedicated slip roads to the A421, which flooded in October after heavy rainfall.\nOn Thursday, Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander approved expansion plans at the nearby London Luton Airport.\nUniversal previously described the Bedford site as \"an ideal location with convenient, fast rail links to London and London Luton Airport\". \nNandy also said the government's commitment to improve local transport infrastructure had helped secure the deal with Universal.\nShadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the previous Conservative administration worked closely with Universal Studios to \"secure the land\" and \"bring forward the plans\".\n\"We're pleased that, despite Labour's economic mismanagement, Universal Studios has committed to investing in Bedfordshire,\" he added.\nMike Cavanagh, the president of Comcast Corporation, which owns Universal, said he was excited to expand the parks brand into Europe.\nThe company said it would work with Bedford Borough Council on the project.\nThe local authority was one of six councils to support the plans last year, alongside Central Bedfordshire, Luton, Milton Keynes, north Northamptonshire and west Northamptonshire councils.\nMayor of Bedford Tom Wootton told BBC Breakfast it was the \"best news\" for the town in \"a very long time\".\n\"Some of the brightest and most fantastic people at Universal are working on [the infrastructure],\" he said.\nBedford residents had mixed thoughts on the plans when asked on Wednesday.\nMargaret Wilson, 85, from Elstow, said she would not visit the theme park but believed her grandsons, aged 19 and 16, would enjoy it.\nBut she said: \"It will be four years until anything is built. Who knows what will happen in four years?\"\nMaria Perez, a warehouse worker in the area, said the theme park would be \"really great\" for families and young people.\n\"It will be good for the economy, for the town and for the people. People will invest more.\"\nShe said it would not be good for rent prices, but overall felt it would be positive for Bedford.\nJagdeep Singh is a 36-year-old business change analyst from Kempston.\nWhile he believed the theme park would drive businesses and bring jobs, he feared the number of visitors could have a negative effect.\n\"I worried a bit about traffic on the bypass - what's going to happen to our hospitals if there's any accidents?\" he added.\nThe proposals remain subject to a planning decision from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

He is really down to earth and also sympathetic off the pitch. But on the pitch he is a leader, smart and aggressive in a good way.\"\nAfter Salah scored in the 2013 Europa League quarter-final win against Tottenham, Yakin said: \"If Mohamed could score as well, he would not be here any more.\"\nAnd when he did start scoring, Yakin was proved right.\nHe left for Chelsea, where he only played 530 minutes in the league, before loan spells at Fiorentina and Roma, signing permanently for the latter prior to going to Liverpool.\nThe Football News Show. Salah reaction and Premier League weekend preview\n'Liverpool's future is bright with new Salah deal'\nThis video can not be played\nSlot 'very happy' with Salah contract extension\nSalah put the marker down in a sensational first season at Liverpool when he scored 44 goals and had 14 assists in 52 appearances, which only underscores the damage done when he lasted just 31 minutes in that campaign's Champions League final in Kyiv, injuring his shoulder when he was felled by Sergio Ramos in a 3-1 defeat by Real Madrid.\nHe gained redemption when scoring from the penalty spot as Liverpool beat Tottenham in the following year's final in Madrid.\nAs a testimony to his constant impact, Salah's lowest goals total in a full season came the following campaign when he \"only\" scored 23 as Liverpool won the title for the first time in 30 years.\nSalah's current tally of 243 Liverpool goals in 394 games now places him third in their all-time scorers, having overtaken the legendary Billy Liddell's total of 228 and Gordon Hodgson (241) this season.\nHe remains behind 1966 World Cup-winner Roger Hunt (285) and all-time record scorer Ian Rush (346).\nIn a season in which he already has 27 Premier League goals - making him the leading scorer this term - he is closing in on some of the competition's legendary figures.\nSalah has 184 Premier League goals, level fifth on the all-time list with Sergio Aguero after moving ahead of Thierry Henry on 175 and Frank Lampard's 177.\nOnly Andrew Cole (187), Wayne Rooney (208), Harry Kane (213) and leading scoring Alan Shearer (260) are ahead of him.\nHe is Liverpool's leading Premier League goalscorer with 182 goals goals in 281 games, his remarkable hit rate placed into context by the record of another Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler, who is in second place. He played 266 matches in the Premier League for the club, scoring 128 goals.\nFor Liverpool at Anfield alone, Salah has a remarkable 103 goals in 142 home Premier League games.\nWhen he reached a total of 250 goal involvements with Liverpool's third in the 3-1 win against Leicester City on Boxing Day in his 250th Premier League start for Liverpool, he was only the fourth player to hit this landmark with one club.\nSalah has since moved on to 267 goal involvements - Wayne Rooney had 276 for Manchester United and Old Trafford team-mate Ryan Giggs had 271, while Harry Kane totalled 259 at Tottenham.\nThe strike that wrapped up the win against the Foxes was the 100th home goal of his Premier League career, including two he scored for Chelsea.\nWhen he scored in the 5-0 win at West Ham United on 29 December, it meant Salah had scored 20 goals in all competitions in each of his eight seasons at Liverpool.\nA measure of quality is always how a player performs away from the comfort zone of home territory. Salah delivers on every level, having scored 79 times in league games away from Anfield.\nSalah is the man for all occasions and all locations, as proved when he became the first Liverpool player to score 50 goals in Europe in the 2-1 Champions League win against Lille at Anfield, nine more than former captain Gerrard.\nLiverpool's fans demanded Salah be given a new Anfield deal after his stunning form under Arne Slot\nSalah's decision to move his Liverpool career towards the decade mark is a sign of continuing hunger for the game's biggest prizes, as well as an act of faith in the management of Slot to help him achieve his goals.\nLiverpool's supporters will be overjoyed at agreement being reached, having made their feelings clear when Salah used rare public utterances to bring an impasse over his contract into the public domain.\nWhen Salah used the stage at Southampton to expose his contract deadlock, it was only the third time in seven and a half years he had stopped to speak to reporters.\nThe first was in April 2018, the result of a promise made to journalists after reaching 40 goals in his debut season, then after the Champions League final win against Spurs 14 months later.\nIt was looked upon as a public exercise in getting talks moving, further evidence that Liverpool was always the place where Salah wanted to be. If that was the ploy it did not work immediately - but the desired outcome has now been achieved.\nThe Kop had already delivered its verdict with the banner based on his trademark goal celebration containing the message: \"He Fires A Bow. Now give Mo His Dough.\"\nNow that wish, as well as Salah's, has been fulfilled.\nSaudi Arabia would have been fertile ground for Salah financially, but it could not offer the enticement of the biggest honours in the game, something he can still pursue at Liverpool.\nSalah's relationship with former manager Klopp looked strained towards the end of last season, including a very public spat at West Ham United when Liverpool conceded a goal as he waited to come on as substitute in a 2-2 draw.\nHe did not break stride as he walked past reporters but his words \"if I speak there will be fire\" did nothing to disguise tensions.\nThis season, despite a recent dip from his stellar standards, Salah has thrived under Slot. He has, at times, almost looked like a man on a personal mission to re-establish Liverpool as the dominant force in domestic football.\nThis video can not be played\n'He's an icon' - Liverpool fans react to Salah's new contract\nLiverpool, cashing in on Manchester City's collapse and a faltering Arsenal, have established superiority in the Premier League, although the loss to Paris St-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League was a disappointment after finishing top of the new league league table format to reach the knockout phase.\nWhen Liverpool hit the top of the Premier League table with victory over Brighton at Anfield on 2 November, Salah reacted on X with: \"Top of the table is where this club belongs. Nothing less.\"\nAnd that is where Liverpool have stayed, with Salah the main inspiration.\nLiverpool's form under the calm, methodical Dutchman Slot, plus the fact they show every sign of hunting down those major honours Salah craves now and in the future, will all have played into the Egyptian's thinking.\nHe will surely secure a second Premier League title, but Salah will also believe he should have more than one Champions League after mixed fortunes in the competition.\nHe had the fateful injury against Real Madrid in Kyiv in the 2018 final and then suffered anguish against the same opponents in the final in Paris four years later in what became a personal duel with keeper Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian produced six saves from Salah alone as Real again broke Liverpool hearts with a 1-0 win.\nFinancial considerations, of course, will have played their part, but the prospect of leading a rebuilt, rejuvenated Liverpool into a new era under Slot will also have appealed.\nSalah on a mission is a dangerous prospect. He now has the opportunity to add to his trophy haul of one Champions League, one Premier League, one FA Cup, two League Cups, the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup at Anfield.\nIt means that for Salah and Liverpool, the perfect sporting marriage goes on.\nThis video can not be played\n'Salah has the mentality to play until he's 40'\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

Russia declined to comment on Zelensky's revelation on Wednesday.\nHowever, China's foreign ministry said it was \"verifying the relevant situation with the Ukrainian side\", but that it had consistently urged Chinese nationals to steer clear of any armed conflicts.\nIt added that Kyiv's accusation that more Chinese citizens were involved in the fighting was \"groundless\".\nIn a statement on social media platform X, Zelensky said the soldiers were captured in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region with identification documents, including bank cards which had \"personal data\" on them.\nUkraine's forces fought six Chinese soldiers and took two of them prisoner, he said.\nThe post was accompanied by a video showing one of the alleged Chinese captives in handcuffs, speaking Mandarin Chinese and apparently describing a recent battle.\n\"We have information suggesting that there are many more Chinese citizens in the occupier's units than just these two,\" he said.\n\"Russia's involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war,\" Zelensky added.\nThe Ukrainian president called for a response \"from the United States, Europe, and all those around the world who want peace\".\nAn investigation is under way and the captives are currently in the custody of Ukraine's security service, he added.\nOn Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the reports \"disturbing\".\nShe added that China is a \"major enabler\" of Russia's war in Ukraine, citing its supply of dual-use goods such as navigation equipment, semiconductor chips and jet parts.\nUkraine's foreign minister said that he had summoned China's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Kyiv to \"demand an explanation\".\nWriting on X, Andrii Sybiha said: \"We strongly condemn Russia's involvement of Chinese citizens in its war of aggression against Ukraine, as well as their participation in combat against Ukrainian forces.\"\nHe added that the move \"puts into question China's declared stance for peace\" and undermines Beijing's credibility as a member of the UN Security Council.\nFrench newspaper Le Monde has previously reported that it identified around 40 accounts on TikTok's sister app, Douyin - which is only available in China - belonging to Chinese individuals who claim to have signed up with the Russian army.\nNorth Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia's war effort against Ukraine, according to Kyiv and Western officials.\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Zelensky said: \"But there is a difference: North Koreans fought against us on the front in Kursk, the Chinese are fighting on the territory of Ukraine.\"\nIn January Ukraine said it captured two injured North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk Oblast.\nWhile Beijing and Moscow are close political and economic allies, China has attempted to present itself as a neutral party in the conflict and has repeatedly denied supplying Russia with military equipment.\nIn its response on Wednesday, the foreign ministry in Beijing appeared to indicate that if Chinese citizens had been captured by Ukrainian forces then they had been operating in a private capacity.\n\"It is important to emphasise that the Chinese government has consistently urged its citizens to stay away from conflict zones and to avoid involvement in armed conflicts in any form - particularly participation in military actions on any side,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian.\nOne of Russia's chief advantages in the war is numbers. There have been reports of Moscow using \"meat grinder\" tactics to throw huge numbers of soldiers at the front lines and incrementally improve their position.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory, mostly in the east.\nRussian drone attacks into Ukraine continued on Tuesday night with strikes injuring 14 people in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, and another two in Kharkiv, in the north-east, local officials said. A number of fires were reported in the two cities.",

Russia declined to comment on Zelensky's revelation on Wednesday.However, China's foreign ministry said it was \"verifying the relevant situation with the Ukrainian side\", but that it had consistently urged Chinese nationals to steer clear of any armed conflicts.It added that Kyiv's accusation that more Chinese citizens were involved in the fighting was \"groundless\".In a statement on social media platform X, Zelensky said the soldiers were captured in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region with identification documents, including bank cards which had \"personal data\" on them.Ukraine's forces fought six Chinese soldiers and took two of them prisoner, he said.The post was accompanied by a video showing one of the alleged Chinese captives in handcuffs, speaking Mandarin Chinese and apparently describing a recent battle. \"Russia's involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war,\" Zelensky added.The Ukrainian president called for a response \"from the United States, Europe, and all those around the world who want peace\".An investigation is under way and the captives are currently in the custody of Ukraine's security service, he added.On Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the reports \"disturbing\".She added that China is a \"major enabler\" of Russia's war in Ukraine, citing its supply of dual-use goods such as navigation equipment, semiconductor chips and jet parts.Ukraine's foreign minister said that he had summoned China's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Kyiv to \"demand an explanation\".Writing on X, Andrii Sybiha said: \"We strongly condemn Russia's involvement of Chinese citizens in its war of aggression against Ukraine, as well as their participation in combat against Ukrainian forces. \"He added that the move \"puts into question China's declared stance for peace\" and undermines Beijing's credibility as a member of the UN Security Council.French newspaper Le Monde has previously reported that it identified around 40 accounts on TikTok's sister app, Douyin - which is only available in China - belonging to Chinese individuals who claim to have signed up with the Russian army.North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia's war effort against Ukraine, according to Kyiv and Western officials.What we know about North Korean troops fighting Russia's warAbout 1,000 North Koreans killed fighting Ukraine in Kursk, officials sayIn a press conference on Tuesday, Zelensky said: \"But there is a difference: North Koreans fought against us on the front in Kursk, the Chinese are fighting on the territory of Ukraine. \"In January Ukraine said it captured two injured North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk Oblast.While Beijing and Moscow are close political and economic allies, China has attempted to present itself as a neutral party in the conflict and has repeatedly denied supplying Russia with military equipment.In its response on Wednesday, the foreign ministry in Beijing appeared to indicate that if Chinese citizens had been captured by Ukrainian forces then they had been operating in a private capacity.",

        "article_text": "While on holiday in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week, there was only one mission on my mind - getting my hands on the viral \"Dubai chocolate\" bar.\nIf you're on TikTok, you will have seen the bar, which combines the flavours of chocolate, pistachio and tahini with filo pastry, and is inspired by the Arab dessert Knafeh.\nThe original, called Can't Get Knafeh of It, by FIX Chocolatier, has been sold exclusively in the UAE since 2022. It become so popular on social media that it's only on sale for two hours a day and often sells out within minutes.\nBut now imitations, known by the nickname \"Dubai chocolate\", have hit UK supermarkets including Waitrose, Lidl and Morrisons, with some supermarkets limiting the number of bars customers are allowed to buy.\nYezen Alani, who co-owns FIX with his wife Sarah Hamouda, told the BBC the global attention Dubai chocolate was getting was \"flattering and humbling\".\nThe FIX chocolate bar was first imagined by Hamouda in 2021, who craved the flavours while she was pregnant.\nAlani and Hamouda started developing the bar a year later, running the business alongside their corporate jobs.\n\"Sarah and I were brought up in the UK and we moved to Dubai 10 years ago, so we've got Western and Arab roots.\n\"We wanted to create flavours that were inspired by that,\" Alani says.\nPart of the appeal of the chocolate is its exclusivity - you can only order it using a food delivery app, rather than walking into a shop or grabbing it at the supermarket.\nIt costs around \u00a315 per bar and can only be bought during specific hours of the day to ensure the company can fulfil all their orders.\nI also saw similar bars sold in many shops in the region, dubbed \"Dubai chocolate\" and adorned with pictures of pistachios and filo pastry.\nAlani says the \"copycat\" bars are \"very frustrating because people are trying knockoffs, which damages our brand\".\nOne of the reasons for the bar's surge in popularity has been social media - with a viral video by TikTok user Maria Vehera  from 2023 being cited as one of the main reasons for its rise to prominence.\nIt shows Vehera trying the Knafeh bar for the first time - along with several others made by the same chocolatier - and has been liked nearly seven million times.\nThe way the bar looks is made for social media -  from the attractive orange and green spots on top of the smooth milk chocolate to the crunch sound it makes when you break off a piece.\nChocolate combined with pistachio isn't new but the real standout element is the crunchy nature of the filling, with the filo pastry adding a texture and thickness to the bar.\nSince the Can't Get Knafeh of It bar is only available in one country, other brands have started to sell their versions in the UK, including Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt whose Dubai chocolate is being sold for \u00a310 in supermarkets.\nSince stocking the bar, Waitrose says they've had to introduce a two-bar limit for customers in order to regulate stock levels.\nAnother version has also been sold by Home Bargains, while supermarket Lidl has its own version for \u00a34.99 and is also limiting purchase numbers.\nOne influencer documented how the bar been kept behind tills for this reason.\nHaving tried the Lindt bar and a couple of other versions being sold in corner shops, there is quite a contrast.\nThe FIX chocolate is billed as a \"dessert bar\" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items.\nThis isn't the case for the others, which have been designed to have a longer shelf life.\nYou can also see the difference in taste and texture - the original bar is almost double the width of the Lindt bar, which is more aligned to the size and shape of a standard chocolate bar.\nWhen Alani and Hamouda first started out, they employed one person to fulfil around six to seven orders a day.  \nBut since growing in popularity, primarily thanks to TikTok, their business now employs 50 people, who fulfil 500 orders a day.\nOne big talking point has been the price of the product, which is \u00a315 per bar.\n\"It's all handmade, every single design is done by hand,\" Alani says.\n\"We use premium ingredients and the process is not like making other bars - you've got the baking, moulding the chocolate to the design and with the filling itself, even the pistachios are hand-picked and processed\". \nSpeaking to Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said: \"My mother used to make Knafeh, and that's something I wanted to capture my own way.\n\"Knafeh was the first flavour we perfected. The crunch, the pistachio, it had to be just right,\" she added.\nDespite the product's success, Alani says \"it's been a tough journey\" as the pair have been working together full time while also raising their two children.\n\"There's been times where we've wanted to give up, but we said to ourselves 'we'll keep going as long as we can pay the rent' and now we have no regrets as its worked out\".

It become so popular on social media that it's only on sale for two hours a day and often sells out within minutes.But now imitations, known by the nickname \"Dubai chocolate\", have hit UK supermarkets including Waitrose, Lidl and Morrisons, with some supermarkets limiting the number of bars customers are allowed to buy.Yezen Alani, who co-owns FIX with his wife Sarah Hamouda, told the BBC the global attention Dubai chocolate was getting was \"flattering and humbling\".Sarah Hamouda/Yezen AlaniHusband and wife Yezen Alani and Sarah Hamouda created their chocolate business togetherThe FIX chocolate bar was first imagined by Hamouda in 2021, who craved the flavours while she was pregnant.Alani and Hamouda started developing the bar a year later, running the business alongside their corporate jobs.

That is when there is expectation to win. That is when the fans are on you. There are 20 minutes to go, it's 0-0 or you are getting beaten. The pressure is heaped on you. Have you got it in you to stand up and be counted?\nThat is what makes or breaks a Rangers player. And, in this squad, there are not enough players with the mentality to get through those periods. That for me is where this squad is at - and that is the aspect that has let them down.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\nThis video can not be played\nSaturday's loss to Hibernian set an unwanted Rangers record of five straight home defeats\nThat is separate to the technical attributes of these players, though. They are good footballers. They have shown that in European games. They have shown that against Celtic. \nIt was only last month they knocked Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce out of the Europa League and went to Celtic Park and won for the first time in years.\nBut those games bring a different pressure. They bring a different expectation. Going into big European games, especially in the knockout rounds, rarely is there expectancy on Rangers to win.\nMeanwhile, domestically, they simply need to win, win, win. Their tempo needs to be high. They need to commit more bodies forward. \nHow many times have you watched a Rangers game where their two centre-halves are in the attacking half against one striker? That is because, in basic terms, they have to commit more in an attacking sense.\nBut you are at risk if you lose the ball. Just look at Hibernian's second goal on Saturday. It comes from a point where Rangers' defensive-minded players are in Hibs' half.\nIn Europe, you will rarely see that situation with a Rangers team, because they have more focus on the defensive side of their game.\nThe easier thing to do in football is be a defensive team. That is what I think this Rangers team are more comfortable doing. They feel more at ease playing in a defensively organised team that can then counter-attack. \nWhy is it easier? Well, in those moments, you are not coaching a set pattern to break a team down. When that is your gameplan, inevitably when you get possession, the opposition are not set up to be broken down. \nThese Rangers players are intelligent footballers. They get the gameplan of stopping the opposition and being clinical on the counter. They have shown that under Barry Ferguson away to Fenerbahce and Celtic playing in a 3-4-3 set-up.\nIn those games, when Rangers have won the ball, they have been in positions to score goals because even when they are sitting deep in a defensive formation, they always have three attackers forward.\nDefensively, they have more players deeper in the pitch and enough bodies to defend. And, in the attacking sense, having one striker and two number 10s means it is not just Cyriel Dessers or Vaclav Cerny running forward themselves.\nRangers' average player positions in last month's 3-1 win at Fenerbahce (left) and Saturday's defeat at home to Hibs (right) show a stark contrast between where their defensive line typically sits in European and domestic games\nThat approach did not work so well in the home leg against Fenerbahce, or the first half of their league game at Dundee, when they were perhaps expected to take the game to the opposition.\nBut for Thursday's encounter with Athletic Bilbao, I feel the first leg being at home should suit Rangers.\nMost European games that are two-legged affairs, particular in the latter stages of competitions, the first leg is always more cagey. It will probably be accepted a bit more by the Ibrox crowd if Rangers are a bit more solid. \nRangers would bite your hand off to go into that second leg in Bilbao at 0-0. But, make no mistake about it, this will be their toughest European game to date this season. \nThey are going to face a seriously technical team who are fourth in Spain's top flight. They have a top, top coach like Ernesto Valverde - a two-time La Liga winner as Barcelona boss - and they play with good tempo in their approach. \nThat is their model and how they play, so expect their set-up behind the ball to be really good if counter-attack opportunities arise for Rangers.\nThere is no getting away from how big a task this is for Ferguson and his unpredictable players, but that is not to say they cannot hurt them - they can.\nFormer Rangers striker Steven Naismith was speaking to BBC Sport Scotland's Nick McPheat",

        "article_text": "Scientists in the high Arctic are lifting their labs into the air to avoid damage from melting permafrost.\nNy-\u00c5lesund in Norway's Arctic is the world's most northerly settlement. A team of scientists surrounded by glaciers, polars bears, walruses and arctic foxes call this hostile environment home while they're researching the Arctic's ice, ecosystems and atmosphere.\n\"The polar night is always the hardest,\" explains Marion Maturilli, a scientist studying Arctic climate dynamics with the French and German Polar Institutes, who is based at the station.\nFor more than 50 years, Ny-\u00c5lesund has housed an international community at the top of the world just 1,200km (745 miles) from the North Pole. Remnants of scientific equipment from the mission which mapped the lines of longitude which define our time zones, still stand at Ny-\u00c5lesund. More recently, Nasa used the base for its satellite lasers and measurements of the Earth's electrical field. Now, scientists from 10 countries live there to conduct their research. For almost three months at a time, they wake and go to sleep in darkness. Their experiments stretch from space to the mysteries of phytoplankton, microplastic pollution, walrus behaviour and alterations in Arctic cyclones.\nThe need to protect the unique polar archipelago resulted in the Svalbard Environmental Protection Act, which was one of the world's first international environmental protection agreements. But the impact left on this pristine landscape by the researchers is necessary, the scientists say.\nMaturilli's team records long-term series of temperature and solar radiation measurements at Ny-\u00c5lesund. Everyday for 30 years, the team at the German station used a weather balloon to raise a radiosonde \u2013 a small instrument which measures atmospheric conditions \u2013 which has to be carefully operated to prevent icing up in the clouds. The results are used to make accurate up-to-date weather forecasts but also document the long-term changes of temperature in the upper air of the region.\u00a0 These measurements depend on having precise and accurate reference points made at the station's high latitudes which give the global coverage and even our place in space.\n\"It doesn't sound spectacular but our daily measurements have produced reliable data for an international climate reference observing network,\" says Maturilli.\nBut to limit the impact of the settlement, only around 30 people are permitted live at the research station year-round.\n\"We do everything we can from planning to execution to change the Arctic as little as possible but this research is vital\", explains Iain Rudkin, the Arctic Operations Manager for the British Antarctic Survey.\nEfforts to mitigate their own environmental impacts are a high priority according to Geir Gotaas, leader of the Norwegian Polar Institute at the base.\nScientists are careful to collaborate to avoid any duplicated research. The teams on the base share data and boat rides to collect Arctic specimens and are planning to transition to electric snowmobiles \u2013 although there are challenges. \"In the field researchers typically cover long distances and bring a lot of heavy equipment, and EV snowmobiles aren't up to the task \u2013 yet,\" says Gotaas.\nAnd, while protecting the rare ecosystem is enshrined in the Svalbard Treaty, the carbon footprint must also be limited so the science itself is not derailed.\n\"It's very important to limit our carbon footprint when we are working in such a unique environment\", Maturilli says. She explains that if a car or engine snowmobile visits the atmospheric lab, the data for these periods is not usable due to the carbon increases. (Read more about why\u00a0Ny-\u00c5lesund is the town with the cleanest air in the world.)\n\"Worsened battery performance in cold conditions and any projects which involve sea or diving activities are very difficult because the logistics use up many resources,\" she adds. \"We co-ordinate within the international community of climate researchers, each doing a puzzle piece to make sure we optimise activities so there's benefits for all\".\nThe site has enabled long-term research in the high Arctic and unique collaboration between countries and disciplines. The scientists share equipment \u2013\u00a0everything from meteorologic balloons to second hand winter clothing.\nThe Korean Polar Institute's team is one such example of cross-country collaboration. The team used results from a project carried out by a German-Nordic partnership. The work led to the Korean team publishing a paper about how Arctic ecosystems operate during the dark.\nYoo Kyung Lee from the Korean Polar Institute says she also minimises her carbon footprint at the station by freeze-drying her plant samples to transport back to South Korea for further energy-intensive experiments. The frozen samples show the multi-generational changes in Svalbard's plant life. From the base, she monitors changes in the plants \u2013 creating DNA markers to distinguish populations and later sequences their genomes so she can study their adaptations to the changing climate.\nIn addition the Norwegian and Italian bases are collaborating in the Ice Memory operation, collecting cores to preserve these rich records before they disappear. The cores are sampled as twins, one being used for research and the other sent for preservation meaning that future generations of scientists can access high-quality cores to study the environmental conditions of our planet long after glaciers may have disappeared due to global warming.\nAt the busiest times for conducting research in the summer when the sun never sets, the population still remains less than 200, with food and waste strictly managed. The researchers eat the same meals as each otherin only one room to limit the container ship deliveries and the waste generated is sorted in 10 to 15 fractions \u2013\u00a0fractions is the term for waste categories such as food, cardboard, glass \u2013 and shipped to the Norwegian mainland for recycling\nThe majority of the produce comes from Norwegian wholesale suppliers and is imported from the mainland as there is no agricultural produce in Svalbard. Gotaas says they try to keep food waste at a minimum.\n\"The most important step is quite simple; only prepare the amount of food needed to feed the number of people in Ny-\u00c5lesund at any given time,\" he explains.\nLeftovers are typically served as part of lunch the following day and whatever is left of food waste is shipped to the Norwegian mainland for composting and regular waste handling.\u00a0\nWhile undertaking their projects, scientists regularly receive spot check visits when their power usage is scrutinised \u2013 with use of electronic devices limited to conserve electricity. The power station which provides electricity and hot water still runs on diesel, although heat exchangers have been installed to extract as much heat and energy as possible from the power generator exhausts. Smaller measures are also implemented, such as installing more efficient ventilation systems in the labs, switching from regular light bulbs to LED lights, having motion sensors to switch off lights automatically, and lowering of the temperature in rooms that are not being used.\nResearch instruments themselves are meticulously tracked across this remote landscape \u2013 each registered in a Geographic Information System (GIS) layer \u2013 or collection of geographic data \u2013 with every project's tools mapped and constantly updated. The general rule is that all projects should have a start and end date so that instruments no longer active are quickly collected, explains Gotaas. Because of the need to provide environmental data of the highest quality possible, Geir says it is in \"everyone's interest to keep the local carbon footprint at a minimum to avoid any disturbance to the sensitive measurements\".\nThe stations themselves are as vulnerable as the ecosystem. The buildings, which function as both living quarters and laboratories were built as early as 1910, though to the 1960s.\nImproving insulation is a step typically taken when renovating the old buildings. But since many of the oldest buildings in Ny-\u00c5lesund are protected as cultural heritage, there are limits to what changes can be made. So, the scientists focus on improving efficiency and have installed the heat exchangers for this purpose.\u00a0\nBut due to the melting permafrost, the stations are shifting and tilting with doors no longer fitting their frames, and pools of water are rotting their wooden foundations. To tackle this problem, the teams devised an engineering method to move the stations using car jacks to raise and then lower the buildings on new steel girded frames. In some cases engineers must drill 50m (164ft) deep into the bedrock and reinforce concrete pillars which have replaced the original wooden supports.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nWhen the station was first built, the permafrost was so stable that this wasn't necessary, but with the changes from global warming over the last decades causing thawing permafrost several of the old buildings have extensive damages as the structural integrity has been compromised. Geir says that inserting steel pillars into the bedrock will \"prevent damages from occurring, and reduce the need for expensive maintenance and reparations\".\u00a0\nTwo or three people can pull the entire building off its foundations, simply cut its electricity for half an hour and then reconnect it with none of the ongoing lab research compromised. With the Italian station already moved, the UK station is next in line in spring.\nSvalbard is the fastest warming place in the world, and even within the Arctic. Leaving as little trace as possible is a challenge for the whole Ny-\u00c5lesund community. Now, not only the results but the research itself is being outpaced by the climate crisis as it becomes more seasonally dependent.\nUntil recently, scientists hoping to study the sea ice in the Arctic could research at the station but the presence of sea ice can no longer be guaranteed. \"Normally now it is too warm and turbulent for the sea ice so we've had to turn down some projects otherwise the scientists could lose their funding,\" explains Rudkin.\nMore like this:\u00a0 \n\u2022 An icy plunge: Diving under sea ice for science\n\u2022 The race to study Antarctica before it melts\n\u2022 The astronauts of the underworld\nThe work that takes place on the research base informed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that the Arctic is likely to be nearly ice-free in the summer before 2050, with Arctic sea ice cover already at its lowest level since at least 1850. And if scientists cannot research this sea ice, Rudkin worries about what will be lost to science.\n\"It's incredibly sad. Over 15 years, I've seen it change too much. [The] mind-blowing scenery gets under your skin and you fall in love with it. But I have two small kids and the thought of what world I'm leaving behind for them is always on my mind,\" Rudkin says.\n\"In daily life I meet people who ask me if the Arctic is actually changing,\" says Rudkin. \"I wish they could see how much its lost so quickly.

        "article_text": "President Trump has been justifying his sweeping tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\".\nHe has imposed tariffs - or import taxes - on countries around the world, including a 125% rate on goods imported from China. In response, China is hiking its tariffs on American imports. \nSome of Trump's claims on trade are unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\n\"We're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\", Trump has said about his new tariff regime on Tuesday. \nBBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 7 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $215m (\u00a3168m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based it on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs (as of 2 April) is 22%. \nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level. \nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April. \nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day. \nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. \nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported. \nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. \nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\". \n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said. \nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false. \nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false. \nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA.  \nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

She said the doll celebrates \"LeBron as a role model,\" his ability as an icon to transcend culture and set a \"positive example for the next generation.\"\nThe doll features the Los Angeles Lakers basketball player in his pre-game fashion and reflects his height - it's an inch taller than the standard Ken doll. \nIn reality, the athlete is 6ft 9in tall.\nThe new doll comes as the company is facing financial uncertainty amid President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China, where just under 40% of Mattel's production is based.\nTrump announced on Wednesday that tariffs on goods from China would increase to 125%. He accused Beijing of a \"lack of respect\" after it retaliated and said it would impose tariffs of 84% on US imports.\nIn the same announcement, Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs and authorised a universal \"lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%\" as negotiations continued with roughly 60 countries. \nMattel has said it may have to increase prices and possibly implement changes to its supply chain. Consumer and business groups in the US have warned that the tariffs may disrupt supply chains and lead to higher prices.\nThe new Ken doll doesn't show the athlete in his basketball uniform. Instead, he's dressed in a varsity jacket adorned with \"LJ\" on the front. \nIt includes an Ohio patch and a crown patch on one sleeve and the number 23 - his basketball jersey number - on the other. On the back, \"LeBron\" is boldly printed along with the phrase, \"Just a kid from Akron\" - the Ohio city where he was born. \nUnder the jacket, the doll wears a shirt that reads \"We Are Family,\" a nod to the star's foundation. The doll includes accessories like a basketball, headphones and sneakers.\nIn a promotional video released by Mattel, Mr James reacted to see the doll for the first time. \"Oh, he dope!\" he says as he's given the figurine. \"That's so cool!\" \nAs he toyed with the doll's accessories, he joked the LeBron Ken doll \"might have to do a little lifting, legs are looking skinny\". \nThe move is a significant moment for the 65-year-old Barbie brand, which has made a push in recent years to diversify its dolls and reflect a broader range of careers, body types and backgrounds.\nThough Barbie has previously honoured athletes like Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and Megan Rapinoe, Mr James is the first male sports figure - and the first male figure not from the entertainment industry - to join the lineup.\nEven with four NBA titles, two Olympic gold medals, and a scoring record to his name, Mr James says his new title of \"Kenbassador\" hits differently\u2014because it's about more than basketball.\n\"It's an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness.\"",

In what felt like a trade of verbal blows from a bygone era, Lyon midfielder Nemanja Matic's jibe that Andre Onana is \"one of the worst goalkeepers\" in Manchester United history set the tone for Thursday's Europa League meeting.\nOnana was then at fault for both Lyon's goals in his side's 2-2 draw in the quarter-final first leg - just a day after those comments from former Red Devils player Matic.\nIt means that since the start of last season, Onana has made eight errors leading to goals in all competitions, the most of any keeper playing for a Premier League club.\nBoss Ruben Amorim looked to take the spotlight off his goalkeeper by suggesting he is the one who has made more mistakes than his players this season. \nBut there is no avoiding the questions - did Matic's comments affect Onana's performance on Thursday night? Was playing mind games his intention all along? And how does Onana rebuild his confidence before facing Lyon again next week?\n\"If you get another high-profile player who comes out with a comment like that, despite how much shielding they do, he is going to know it,\" says chartered psychologist Dr Simon Moore.\n\"They're all on social media, they have all got phones and he is not going to be able to avoid it. It will get in his head, because no matter how hard he tries to park it and move on, it will bug him.\n\"The other thing is, you get this reaction of 'well I am going to go out and show everybody that I don't make mistakes and I am over it'. And that puts even more pressure and duress on you to achieve that.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'One of the worst keepers in Man Utd history' - Matic on Onana\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, Matic was asked about Onana's comments from earlier this week that United were \"way better\" than French club Lyon.\nSerbian Matic, who played for United from 2017-2022, responded: \"You know, I respect everyone but to say that then you need to give the answer.\n\"If you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's history, you need to take care what you're talking about.\n\"If it was [Edwin] Van der Sar, [Peter] Schmeichel or [David] De Gea saying that, then I would question myself. But you need to have cover to say something like that.\"\nOnana then posted on social media to deny he was being disrespectful.\n\"I would never be disrespectful to another club. We know that tomorrow will be a difficult game against a strong opponent,\" Onana said on X.\n\"We focus on preparing a performance to make our fans proud.\n\"At least I've lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can't say the same.\"\nThis video can not be played\nOnana given vote of confidence by Amorim after errors\n\"He was in the headlines before the game and now he is going to be all over the headlines again,\" said former England winger Aaron Lennon on BBC Radio 5 Live following Onana's errors against Lyon. \n\"I think he looks a bit silly tonight and Matic is probably the one who is going to sleep well,\" added former Lyon and England midfielder Izzy Christiansen.\nMoore, who co-hosts the What's Your Goal podcast alongside former England midfielder Katie Chapman, says the brain is wired to pay specific attention to risk, threat and mistakes from an \"ego, status and reputation point of view\".\n\"Given the fact he is a goalkeeper at a very famous club and there is a lot of pressure on shoulders anyway within that team, they have had a lot of negative media throughout the year, he is going to have a double whammy effect,\" Moore says.\n\"What you are doing is signalling to your brain, rather than 'how can I do well?', is 'how can I avoid a mistake?'.\"\nMatt Shaw is a chartered sports psychologist at InnerDrive, who work with players from senior internationals to academy level.\n\"We often talk about external noise and trying to limit it as much as possible,\" says Shaw. \"In some sense, it could be a coincidence those comments were made and then he had a poor performance.\n\"You might look at other times this season where no comments were made and he had good or bad performances after that as well.\"\nShaw says what is being said off the pitch can often be \"overhyped\" because of its importance to fans and the media, rather than the players themselves.\n\"A lot of these guys, it is water off a duck's back,\" he explains. \"When it does impact players it's really interesting, because we often forget they are experts in what they do - experts can have poor performance - but also in terms of how they handle those situations.\n\"You see Onana pre-match going straight up to the fans in front of the net, where it looked like it didn't really affect him at all. It can affect these guys, but often it doesn't.\n\"When we are working with players, we are working with them all the time and trying to keep them at a baseline. It is easy to draw a straight line and say lots of stuff happened pre-match and he went on to make mistakes that led to goals. Whereas the chances are, once the game starts, it is very unlikely that is in his mind because he has way more to focus on.\n\"What we always want is players thinking in a helpful way, what do they need to think about and focus in order to perform well? Obviously comments beforehand about being United's poorest goalkeeper aren't the comments we want him thinking about. But I would be surprised if those were in his mind.\"\n'I've made more mistakes than them' - Amorim defends Onana after errors\nHow does Onana compare to other Man Utd keepers after Matic criticism?\nSo what can Onana, and United's backroom staff, do to help focus him going forward?\n\"I would remind him of all the positive things he's been doing, bombard him with all the clips,\" says Moore. \"He's a great stopper, his reflexes are amazing, so remind him.\n\"That will give him confidence, and then maybe play the clips back and say these are areas we need to work on.\n\"Football is a creative sport, that is great for the fan because you get lots of exciting moments, but creativity also means you are going to fail a lot - that is the nature of creativity. He has got to accept he is an industry that oscillates between 'wow' moments and moments you make mistakes.\"\nShaw says, after a debrief, it is about focusing on the action plan going forwards.\n\"And then it's about going into training and practising those things or stripping it all the way back to 'OK, what am I good at? What is the part of the game that makes me who I am as a goalkeeper?' and just focusing on those things instead,\" he adds.\nThe one-week turnaround before facing Lyon in the second leg may seem tight, but Shaw says in football terms that is plenty of time to move on - and Manchester United have another game, at Newcastle on Sunday, to think about first anyway.\n\"The goalkeeper team will be quite tight,\" he adds.\n\"They will be getting around him and then really going back to what they enjoy doing in training and just trying to make sure he is successful in training so it builds some confidence over the course of the week, as well as having those conversations about what we do differently next time.\n\"In any of our walks of life, if something goes wrong, we expect people to get around us, having a little bit of a debrief with a focus on being better next time as opposed to not being good enough - then really just focusing on the things that make him a good goalkeeper and trying to expose those throughout the week.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "Liam Delap is the son of former Premier League midfielder Rory Delap and had spells on loan with Hull, Preston and Stoke before joining Ipswich\nIpswich striker Liam Delap will be available for \u00a330m this summer because of a relegation release clause, which will be triggered when his club inevitably returns to the Championship.\nThe 22-year-old is likely to move on, with interest from several Premier League sides after netting 12 goals in 33 games in all competitions in his first full season in the top flight. \nPreviously, multiple sources told BBC Sport that Delap was expected to be available for \u00a340m in the summer - with his previous club Manchester City holding a 'buy-back' fee at that price.\nHowever, sources at Ipswich have since confirmed to BBC Sport that the release clause value decreases by \u00a310m upon relegation. \nThe Suffolk club lost 2-1 in a key relegation match against Wolves last weekend which has left them 12 points away from safety with only seven games left.\nManager Kieran McKenna accepted relegation \"looks more than likely\".\nDelap has delivered a series of impressive performances this season and his release clause looks like good value.\nPaul MacDonald of FootballTransfers.com says Ipswich spent \"significantly\" above Delap's market value of \u00a36.5m last summer, which was another example of City \"extracting maximum value for their excellent youth production line\".\nHe says the \u00a330m release clause is about right for Delap's current market value given his lack of European and senior international experience and the fact he has had one \"breakout\" season.\nThat is, however, balanced against his age and a \"Premier League premium for English forwards\".\nSo which clubs could make a move for him in the summer? \nFrom Championship to England contention - the rise of 'fearless' Delap\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport chief football news reporter:\nThere is no doubt Manchester United will be one of the clubs with a major interest in Delap this summer.\nThe release clause is less than United paid for Rasmus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee, and Delap has scored more goals than either forward in the Premier League this season. Delap also fits Ruben Amorim's system and the United coach has frequently said his team do not score enough.\nOn that basis, and because talk of a move for Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres is now going cold, a transfer is a no-brainer.\nThe problem for United is the uncertainty over how much money they will have to spend in the summer - they will either earn Champions League qualification via winning the Europa League... or have no European football at all.\nAmorim has said he needs to assess gaps in his squad and where his priorities lie. \nUnited also know there will be a lot of competition for Delap and that could drive the price up beyond \u00a330m, and will drive wages up. It is one of the reasons why they are quite keen to offload high-earners Casemiro and Marcus Rashford this summer, because the comparison with their salaries doesn't help in negotiations either.\nDelap to United could definitely happen. But it is not nailed on.\nBBC Sport football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella:\nChelsea sources have signalled interest in Delap in recent months. \nManager Enzo Maresca worked with him in Manchester City's academy team. Similarly, so did influential recruiter Joe Shields and new academy technical director Glenn van der Kraan. \nThose personal relationships make the Stamford Bridge club serious contenders for his signature, but they are reportedly also interested in RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting's Gyokeres. \nThe new Chelsea regime are also known to prefer signing players that have release clauses written into their contracts.\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport chief football news reporter:\nCity had a \u00a340m buy-back agreement on Delap when they sold him to Ipswich last summer.\nThey also have a 20% sell-on clause on any profit Ipswich make beyond the \u00a320m they initially spent.\nWith Erling Haaland tied to a contract that does not expire until 2034, Omar Marmoush impressing since his winter arrival from Eintracht Frankfurt and Jeremy Doku and Savinho both in favour with Pep Guardiola this season in wide positions, it does not appear City have room for Delap in a way that would offer regular starts, which surely has to be a key selling point.\nIn addition, even with five Champions League spots for English teams, it is not certain City will be in Europe's top competition next season, which is a factor.\nOn that basis City would be unlikely to make a move, although, with a new technical director in Hugo Viana and a summer rebuild on the cards, that does bring an element of the unknown.\nBBC Sport pundit Chris Sutton:\nFor \u00a330m, of course a lot of big teams will be looking at him.\nIt would be a risk going to United with the lack of creativity that they have, but he would be an upgrade on what they have got.\nCompared to Chelsea's main striker, Nicolas Jackson, he is far more physical. He can still run in behind defences but is far more of an all-rounder. Part of the game which I think he could improve is aerially, considering he is 6ft 1in (1.85m).\nWhat I really like is that he has got that sort of swagger about him, and that attitude where he knows he is good, which you need at the bigger clubs.\nHe is too good for Ipswich. I don't want to upset their fans but he was a good signing and a brilliant bit of business for them, and they have enjoyed watching him play. Nobody is going to begrudge him leaving to go to a bigger club.\nIf he went to somewhere like Chelsea or Manchester United then he could be another player who bites Pep in the backside, like Cole Palmer did.\nBut going back to City behind other forwards is not going to help his development, or his England chances.\nArsenal have been linked heavily with Sesko and Gyokeres but not Delap. \nWest Ham are known to want a striker in the summer while Aston Villa and Newcastle could emerge as suitors.\nVilla sold striker Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr in January but signed Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United as a replacement. \nNewcastle striker Callum Wilson is out of contract in the summer and Alexander Isak is continually linked with a move away, despite sources at St James' Park insisting he is not for sale. \nMuch could also come down to the PSR positions of the various clubs and which teams gain the lucrative windfall for qualifying for the Champions League next season. \nLatest Ipswich Town news, analysis and fan views\nGet Ipswich news notifications",

A Pentagon spokesman cited the article, saying \"undermining\" US leadership was not tolerated.\nFollowing Vance's trip, on 31 March, Col Meyers is reported to have written: \"I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice-President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.\"\nMilitary.com - which published the email - said the contents had been confirmed as accurate to them by the US Space Force.\nAppearing to confirm this was the reason for her firing, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell linked to the Military.com article in a post on X, writing: \"Actions [that] undermine the chain of command or to subvert President [Donald] Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense.\"\nThe Space Force's statement announcing Col Meyers' removal on Thursday said that Col Shawn Lee was replacing her. \nIt added: \"Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties.\" \nCol Meyers had assumed command of the Arctic station in July last year.

It has had a military presence on the island since occupying it following the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany during World War Two.\n\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, previously told the BBC.\n\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"\nGreenland, the world's largest island, has been under Danish control for around 300 years. \nPolls show that the vast majority of Greenlanders want to gain independence from Denmark - but do not wish to become part of the US.\nGreenland has had the right to call an independence referendum since 2009, though in recent years some political parties have begun pushing harder for one to take place.",

        "article_text": "Spain beat England in the 2023 final to win their first Women's World Cup\n\"Fifa was right.\"\nThat's how president Gianni Infantino described his organisation's decision to expand the Women's World Cup from 16 teams to 32 for the 2023 tournament.\nLess than two years later he has announced plans for further expansion.\nThe women's tournament is set to follow the lead of the men's World Cup and become a 48-team competition from 2031.\nBut is Fifa right this time? BBC Sport looks at the pros and cons of an expanded Women's World Cup.\nThe 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, which featured eight new teams, threw up plenty of surprises.\nIt was a successful tournament for African nations, with underdogs Morocco, South Africa and Nigeria - ranked 72, 54 and 40 in the world respectively - reaching the last 16.\nMorocco's progression came at the expense of two-time champions Germany, who went out at the group stages a year after reaching the Euro 2022 final.\nZambia, ranked 81st, were the lowest-ranked team to qualify.\nWhile they suffered 5-0 losses to Japan and Spain, they finished third in their group thanks to a 3-1 win over Costa Rica, who were ranked 44 places higher.\nNigeria, 40th in the rankings, lost to eventual runners-up England in a penalty shootout in the last 16.\nOf the 32 teams, only three failed to earn a single point - Costa Rica, Haiti and Vietnam - and only Vietnam failed to score.\nThere were some one-sided scorelines, though, including the Netherlands firing seven past Vietnam and Norway thrashing the Philippines 6-0.\nOnly 44 nations have played in a Women's World Cup.\nWith the tournament expanding by 16 teams, there will be more qualifying places allocated to each of the six Fifa continental zones.\nThat could provide an extra incentive for governments and national football associations - particularly from smaller nations who have not competed on the world stage - to invest in the women's game.\nUS Soccer chief executive JT Batson said the expansion of the 2031 tournament - set to be held in the US - would be \"incredible for growing the women's game\".\n\"One of the things we hear from folks who lead federations around the world is they view the Women's World Cup as an opportunity for them to, one, make a World Cup and, two, really go compete in a way that conceivably they wouldn't be able to on the men's side,\" Batson said., external\n\"So what this would lead to in terms of spurring investment all around the world in women's and girls' soccer, we think would be incredible.\"\nEngland manager Sarina Wiegman said she had reservations about expanding from 24 teams to 32 for the 2023 edition.\nHowever, she changed her mind after the tournament, saying more teams \"made it more competitive\".\n\"It will grow the game again in different countries because they have other opportunities to come and still have challenges to overcome,\" Wiegman said.\n\"Some countries are at different stages of their development, so it will empower women in sport, women in football and women in society.\"\nFrom a UK perspective, more qualifying places would give the home nations a better chance of reaching a tournament on home soil in 2035.\nWhile England have established themselves as one of the world's best teams, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland have played in only one World Cup, and Wales and Northern Ireland have never qualified.\nWales and Scotland lost in the play-off finals for the 2023 tournament.\nWales missed out on a first major tournament when Switzerland scored a late extra-time winner in the play-off finals for the 2023 World Cup\nWhen it was announced that the men's World Cup would expand to 48 teams, the immediate concerns were that the competition would be diluted.\nThe same questions have been asked of an expanded Women's World Cup and there are worries that one-sided scorelines and a gulf in quality would devalue the women's game and turn off television audiences.\n\"There is the fear it might dilute some of the competition,\" said former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley.\nShe also highlighted player welfare and adding to an already busy football calendar as possible downsides to an expanded tournament.\n\"There's probably also an element of will the tournament be longer? You're going to see a massive increase in games,\" she said.\n\"Will there be an increase in rest periods? How is that going to affect the domestic calendar? How is that going to affect the player loading and recovery?\"\nQualifying for a World Cup does not guarantee that federations will fully support their women's teams, with the 2023 edition featuring a number of teams, such as Jamaica, who faced battles off the pitch and publicly criticised their federation over facilities and preparation.\nBardsley said there must be a \"real emphasis on developing the game\" if the tournament expands to 48 teams.\n\"There is time but it's going to have to really be prioritised and accelerated,\" she said.\nFifa launched its Women's Football Strategy in 2018 and set a goal of having 60 million girls and women playing football across the globe by 2027.\nWithin its objectives, Fifa aims to ensure all 211 of its members have comprehensive women's football strategies.\nThrough its Women's Development Programme, Fifa also offers its members the opportunity to apply for and access additional resources and specialist expertise to develop women's football.\n\"It's going to be a tall order, but if Fifa serious about this investing in the women's game now, you'll see a massive benefit by 2035,\" Bardsley said.\nFor the teams who do qualify, Fifa has previously promised to match the prize money on offer at the men's World Cup for the 2027 tournament.\nThe first time we will see a 48-team tournament is next year's men's World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the US.\nAt first, Fifa suggested a group-stage format that included 16 groups of three teams, with the top two from each group going through.\nBut that caused controversy because the sides playing in the final group game could play out a result that enabled both to go through at the expense of the other team.\nAfter widespread criticism and a thrilling four-team group stage in Qatar at the 2022 men's World Cup, Fifa revised its plans.\nThe 48 teams will be drawn into 12 groups of four with the top two from each - along with the eight best third-placed nations - advancing to a 32-team knockout stage.\nThere has been no indication yet as to whether a women's tournament would follow the same format.\nThe number of games will rise from 64 in a 32-team competition to 104 with 48 teams, which is likely to mean a longer tournament.\nThe 2026 men's World Cup is set to last 10 days longer than in 2022.",

        "article_text": "It was a typical Friday lunchtime in Beirut's southern suburb. Then, a single warning, posted in Arabic on X by a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), triggered panic and chaos in the densely populated area known as Dahieh.\n\"Urgent warning to those in the southern suburb of Beirut,\" it read. The post included a map of a residential area, marking a building in red and two nearby schools. The IDF identified the building as a Hezbollah facility, and ordered the immediate evacuation of the schools. \nAn air strike was imminent.\nWhat followed were scenes of sheer panic. Parents rushed towards the threatened area to collect their children from the schools, while residents fled in the opposite direction, visibly shaken and fearful.\n\"It was total chaos,\" recalls Ahmad Alama, the director of St Georges School, one of those highlighted on the map. \"We tried to contain the situation as much as we could, but it was crazy.\"\nThe area was soon cleared, and Israeli forces destroyed the marked building, which they said was a warehouse storing Hezbollah drones.\nThe strike, carried out two weeks ago, was the first on Dahieh \u2013 an area with a strong Hezbollah presence \u2013 since a ceasefire ending the war between Israel and Hezbollah took effect last November.\nIt came hours after two rockets were launched from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel. Israel said it intercepted one rocket, while the other fell short of the border.\nHezbollah, the Iran-backed militant and political group, denied involvement. Israel described the rocket fire as a ceasefire \"violation\", while the office of Lebanon's president, Joseph Aoun, condemned the Israeli strike as a \"violation of the agreement\".\n\"We thought the war had ended with the ceasefire,\" says Mr Alama, \"But unfortunately, we're still living it every day.\"\nDespite the ceasefire, Israel has continued near-daily strikes on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, saying it is acting to stop Hezbollah from rearming. The strikes have mainly occurred in southern Lebanon, but the recent bombings in Dahieh have sparked particular alarm.\nOn 1 April, a second Israeli strike hit the area \u2013 this time without warning \u2013 killing a Hezbollah commander and three other people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.\nMr Alama has been running St Georges School for 30 years. It serves around 1,000 children of all ages, boys and girls. Although religion is part of the curriculum for older pupils, he describes the school as secular.\nIt is also well-known in the community for its association with the Lebanese pop star and talent show judge, Ragheb Alama \u2013 Ahmad Alama's brother and the school's owner.\nThe recently destroyed building lies just metres from the school. It isn't the only nearby scene of devastation. Another building, opposite one of St Georges' gates, remains a massive pile of rubble \u2013 brought down by Israeli air strikes before the ceasefire.\nDuring the war, the schools were closed. They didn't have to deal with situations such as the one they faced. Now reopened, they are braced for the possibility of more bombing.\nThe school has devised evacuation plans, designating emergency meeting points in the basement and routes for pupils and staff to follow in case of any danger.\nThere are also new communication plans with parents to prevent a repeat of the chaos of last month's strike. Children are now routinely reminded of these procedures, with regular evacuation drills.\nStudents, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what happened, Mr Alama says.\nInitially, the school considered cutting back on extracurricular activities to make up for lost learning, but they changed their minds.\n\"We decided otherwise,\" Mr Alama says. \"Pupils shouldn't pay the price for something they aren't responsible for. We've actually ended up increasing these activities \u2013 these kids need to release some of the pressure on them.\"\nNearly five months into the ceasefire, the return of Israeli air strikes to Beirut has intensified fears of a return to all-out war.\nThe ceasefire was meant to end more than 13 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which began when Hezbollah launched attacks on Israeli military positions the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe conflict escalated in September 2024, when Israel launched a devastating air campaign across Lebanon and invaded the south of the country.\nDahieh, deserted during the war, is bustling again. Shops have reopened, hookah smokers are back at crowded cafes, and the suburb seems as busy as before, with its persistently paralysing traffic.\nBut amid these signs of normality, scenes of destruction serve as a reminder of the pounding this area endured just months ago.\nSome 346 buildings in the area were destroyed and another were 145 partly damaged by Israeli air strikes, according to a municipal official. Israel said it targeted Hezbollah facilities and weapons caches.\nIn many neighbourhoods, the rubble is still being cleared. The roar of bulldozers and jackhammers drilling into piles of debris is almost constant.\nSome of the mounds of debris have Hezbollah flags planted on top of them, while large and small portraits of Hassan Nasrallah, the former Hezbollah leader killed by Israel during the war, line the roads.\nHowever, amid the customary signs of defiance, many are now expressing a deep concern not always voiced \u2013 at least in front of cameras \u2013 by residents of Dahieh.\n\"The destruction is terrifying. I see the destroyed buildings and I cry,\" says Sawsan Hariri, the headteacher of Burj High School, also in Dahieh. \nThe school, which also sits opposite a flattened building, sustained damage from nearby strikes.\n\"It's depressing. Walking on the street, driving your car - it's all just depressing.\"\nMs Hariri used to live on the top floor of the school building with her husband and daughter, but their home has been destroyed. They now rent a flat nearby.\nBefore the war, Burj High School had around 600 pupils. Now, it has barely 100.\nMany parents are reluctant to send their children back amid the scenes of destruction and the constant buzz of machinery. Others were concerned about the health risks, with thick dust still filling the air.\nAfter the ceasefire, owners of the private school made some basic repairs at their own expense.\nHezbollah, which is banned as a terrorist organisation in many countries but in Lebanon is a political and social movement as well as a paramilitary force, has given those who lost their homes $12,000 for a year's rent and has offered to cover the costs of repairs to apartments. However, schools and other institutions have not received any aid.\nThe Lebanese government has pledged to set up a reconstruction fund, which the World Bank estimates will cost $11bn nationwide. But international donors are believed to be insisting on the disarmament of Hezbollah and political reform \u2013 conditions that appear a distant prospect.\nThough the clearing of rubble is expected to be over by the end of the year, few expect large-scale rebuilding to follow anytime soon.",

        "article_text": "Strolling in bright sunshine across the immaculately raked gravel of Paris's Tuileries gardens, Barbara and Rick Wilson from Dallas, Oregon, were not exactly in disguise. But earlier that morning, on their very first trip to France, Rick, 74, had taken an unusual precaution. \nBefore leaving his hotel, he'd taken a small piece of black tape and covered up the Stars and Stripes flag on the corner of his baseball cap.\n\"We're sick about it. It's horrible. Just horrible,\" said Rick, as he and his wife contemplated the sudden sense of shame and embarrassment they said they now felt, as Americans, following President Trump's abrupt moves on global trading tariffs.\nBarbara, 70, even had a Canadian lapel pin in her pocket \u2013 a gift from another tourist - which she thought might come in useful if further subterfuge proved necessary.\n\"I'm disappointed in our country. We are upset about the tariffs,\" she explained.\nA few yards away, towards the crowds gathering outside the Louvre Museum, another American couple was also trying to keep a lower profile than usual. Chris Epps, 56, an attorney from New York, had decided he would dress a little differently on today's tour.\n\"No New York Yankees hat. I left it in the hotel. People might come up to us, treat us differently. But so far, so good,\" he added.\nAs the world grapples with the implications of Donald Trump's see-sawing quest to upend the global trading system, the impacts are being felt not just on stock markets and businesses and investment funds, but in subtler ways too, and not least here in France, a country that continues to attract vast numbers of tourists from North America, and which has a centuries-old, close, and sometimes testy relationship with the United States.\nTo be clear, there are no indications that Americans are any less welcome here than before. Our interviews with a random selection of tourists were also carried out shortly before President Trump reversed some of his tariffs.\nNonetheless, the shock and anger generated in Europe by events of the past week have added fuel to perceptions of a much larger transatlantic rift \u2013 of a shifting of the tectonic plates of international relations. \nIt is early days, of course. Americans are far from united about their government's actions and much of the evidence for changing sentiments is anecdotal.\nBut there are already some discernible effects on travel, tourism, academia and other fields.\n\"It's a big drop,\" said Philippe Gloaguen, the founder of France's most prestigious travel guides, Le Guide du Routard, sitting behind a cluttered desk in Paris and noting that orders for his books about the US had fallen by 25% so far this year.\nNot that Gloaguen was complaining. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\"I'm very proud of my customers. They are young, well-educated, and very democratic. This was the truth for Putin\u2026 and for China. We know when there's a dictatorship going on in a country,\" he said, arguing that his French readers were beginning to view America in a similar light.\n\"They don't want to spend their money in the United States,\" Gloaguen continued, framing his publication as a sort of global democratic weathervane.\nHe noted that the abrupt fall in US sales was balanced by a rise in sales of books about \"Canada and other countries.\"\nOther evidence from the travel industry is beginning to back up the idea of a growing disenchantment with the United States. The forecasting company, Oxford Economics, is already predicting an 8.9% drop in the number of French people travelling to the US this year compared with 2024.\nAnother recent analysis \u2013 of French expatriates living in the US \u2013 found that a remarkable 78% of them are now \"particularly pessimistic\" about their future in the country, while 73% of people polled within France, in March, believed the US was no longer an \"ally\".\nOver a morning coffee in a Parisian caf\u00e9, Nicolas Conquer \u2013 an enthusiastic Trump supporter and dual French-American citizen who leads the Republicans Abroad Paris branch \u2013 acknowledged \"some volatility\" because of the tariffs but argued that a \"media narrative\" was creating a false impression of strained transatlantic relations.\n\"I'm still standing my ground... reminding people that France and the US have been the oldest allies,\" Conquer said, adding that any negative reaction to Trump's America First agenda was based on a \"childish or immature\" view of international relations.\n\"Everyone knows that we have to have strong sovereignty, strong patriotism, and that\u2026 as Trump supporters go for 'America First', we would expect that\u2026 European governments would also promote UK first, Germany first, France first,\" said Conquer.\nBut concern about the Trump administration's recent actions and rhetoric \u2013 not just in relation to tariffs but also regarding Ukraine and Greenland \u2013 is widespread across France and hard to miss. Politicians, newspapers and television talk shows have all been busy dissecting the changes, often in a tone of bitter disillusionment.\nIn practical terms, the result has sometimes been to offer support to perceived victims of the Trump administration, with French scientific institutions, backed by the French government, beginning to offer places to American researchers who've lost their jobs due to cuts in government funding.\nElsewhere there are indications of nervousness about simply travelling to the US. A prestigious social studies institute in Paris recently sent its students a warning, following reports of foreigners being questioned about their political beliefs and refused entry.\n\"We urge you to be extra vigilant when travelling abroad. It is important not to travel with your usual equipment but to use a shared computer containing only data necessary for your stay and no sensitive data. During border checks, some security services may require the unlocking of digital devices to view information, including private information,\" wrote a professor at EHESS, in a group email seen by the BBC.\nRelations between Paris and Washington have survived many previous shocks \u2013 as, for instance, American taunts about \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\" following France's decision not to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or the more recent spat over calls to return the Statue of Liberty.\nBut France's friendship with the US has never been as unconditionally \"special\" as that claimed by, say, the British. The French may adore Hollywood cinema, country music and the allure of the American Dream, and celebrate ties that date back to America's war of independence, but they have kept some distance too - shunning what's known here as \"Le Woke-isme\" and, today more than ever, celebrating President De Gaulle's determination to build an entirely French-owned nuclear deterrent separate from both Nato and the US.\n\"The American people remain our friend, but [Trump] is no longer our ally,\" the former French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced recently.\n\"It's definitely a relationship of 'love' and not always 'like,'\" said Kerry Halferty-Hardy, the President of the American Club of Paris, citing the ambivalent lyrics of the famous Serge Gainsbourg song, \"Je t'aime - moi non plus.\"\nLooking out of her Paris apartment towards the Eiffel Tower, Halferty-Hardy argued that the shared values of liberty and the Enlightenment linking France and the US \"are not easily dislodged and certainly not on the basis of one administration,\" but she acknowledged that \"no one can ignore what they're seeing in the headlines.\"",

We know when there's a dictatorship going on in a country,\" he said, arguing that his French readers were beginning to view America in a similar light.Orders for Philippe Gloaguen's travel guides about the US have plummeted this year\"They don't want to spend their money in the United States,\" Gloaguen continued, framing his publication as a sort of global democratic weathervane.He noted that the abrupt fall in US sales was balanced by a rise in sales of books about \"Canada and other countries. Just horrible,\" said Rick, as he and his wife contemplated the sudden sense of shame and embarrassment they said they now felt, as Americans, following President Trump's abrupt moves on global trading tariffs.Barbara, 70, even had a Canadian lapel pin in her pocket \u2013 a gift from another tourist - which she thought might come in useful if further subterfuge proved necessary. \"Everyone knows that we have to have strong sovereignty, strong patriotism, and that\u2026 as Trump supporters go for 'America First', we would expect that\u2026 European governments would also promote UK first, Germany first, France first,\" said Conquer.Some however, like Nicolas Conquer, back President Trump's actionsBut concern about the Trump administration's recent actions and rhetoric \u2013 not just in relation to tariffs but also regarding Ukraine and Greenland \u2013 is widespread across France and hard to miss. \"I'm still standing my ground... reminding people that France and the US have been the oldest allies,\" Conquer said, adding that any negative reaction to Trump's America First agenda was based on a \"childish or immature\" view of international relations.",

He escapes jail, but must deal with his guilt when his co-worker takes the blame and is convicted.\nIt explores themes of shame, denial, grief and loyalty, focusing on Joe's complex relationships with those around him, including with his wife Kate (who will be played by Jean-Baptiste). \nThe production, directed by Ivo Van Hove, will play at the Wyndham's Theatre from 14 November to 7 February 2026.\nSpeaking from Los Angeles, where she lives, Jean-Baptiste said: \"All things that deal with the family and relationships remain relevant throughout time, they sort of transcend in that way, and to me it just felt like being able to delve into something that's quite personal.\n\"But also the way that Ivo does stuff kind of feels timeless, and I just felt that this was something that would be really interesting to explore.\"\nShe noted: \"Some of the language is of the time, but I'm interested in the challenge of making it very relevant now, and dealing with loss, denial, guilt are things the human beings do throughout time.\"\nThe play has been revived several times over the decades, and was last performed in London in 2019, with Sally Field and Bill Pullman appearing in a production at the Old Vic. \nAll My Sons will mark Van Hove's third Miller production, having directed A View From A Bridge and The Crucible, which both played in London and on Broadway. \nVan Hove described All My Sons as \"a devastating exploration of guilt, responsibility, and the far-reaching consequences of our choices, especially in times of war\".\nAsked about her ambition for the new production, Jean-Baptiste said: \"I hope it's just something that's fresh, leaves the audience thinking or feeling, that would be my only hope for the production, that it tells a new story, of an old story.\"\nIn a statement, Cranston added: \"Arthur Miller, Ivo Van Hove, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu... If there is something that I know beyond a shadow of doubt, is to surround yourself with the most talented people. \n\"This group of creative artists has got me so excited to be a part of the All My Sons company.\"\nCranston is best known for portraying Walter White in TV series Breaking Bad, and has also appeared in Your Honour and Malcolm in the Middle. \nHe was last on the London stage in a 2017 adaptation of the Oscar-winning movie Network, also directed by Van Hove, at the National Theatre. \nJean-Baptiste is known for appearing in TV crime drama Without A Trace and was nominated for a Bafta earlier this year for her performance in Hard Truths.\nThe film was directed by Mike Leigh, marking his second collaboration with Jean-Baptiste after the pair worked together on 1996's Oscar-nominated Secrets & Lies.\nJean-Baptiste said returning to the UK meant she was also looking forward to \"getting through a load of books, walking, people watching, seeing my family regularly, and friends that still live in London.\"\nBut, in contrast to the sunshine of Los Angeles, Jean-Baptiste joked she would need \"coats, scarves and hats\" given she will be performing in London over winter.",

Now all three are buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed discotheque, after the roof caved in part way through the performance, leaving at least 218 dead.\n\"I haven't heard any news about any of them,\" said Shailyn Pe\u00f1a, M\u00e1ximo's 17-year-old daughter as she sat on a wall outside the devastated venue.\n\"It was just another Monday night for them. In fact, my dad invited my mum to come too but at the last minute she decided not to go. It was a blessing in disguise.\"\nBehind her as she spoke to me on Wednesday afternoon, a team of rescue workers was meticulously going through the rubble inside the building, listening for the slightest sound of a survivor beneath them. \nThey had been joined by Israeli and Mexican search teams and were using sophisticated heat-seeking equipment to try to locate anyone still alive. \nShailyn told me her cousin was one of the rescue workers, sifting through the debris for her own uncle, which she said brought her peace of mind that a relative was inside doing everything in her power to try to track M\u00e1ximo down.\nBut the uncertainty and the endless wait for information were becoming unbearable, Shailyn said.\n\"I feel the urge to just go in there and push aside all the rocks and pull him out. But as much as I want to, I really can't. I just have to sit here and wait it out.\"\nHours later, the government released a statement saying that \"all reasonable chances of finding more survivors have been exhausted\" and so the search and rescue mission would give way to the recovery of bodies. \nThe authorities have been doing what they can to keep the public informed, delivering grim updates on the number of dead, which has risen steadily with every passing hour. \nAt regular intervals, teams have been emerging from the site carrying bodies covered by blankets on stretchers.\nEarlier on, some people were brought out alive, bolstering the hopes of the relatives. \nThe head of the Emergency Operations Center (COE) said that since the roof collapse, 189 people had been \"rescued alive\".\nBut by Wednesday evening, officials said that given the conditions at the site observed by the more than 300 rescue workers, they would conclude the rescue phase of their operations \"within hours\". \nThe president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader, has declared three days of national mourning, a reflection of the scale of the tragedy unfolding at the site. \nAmong those confirmed to have lost their lives in the accident were some well-known national figures including P\u00e9rez himself, two much-loved former baseball players, Octavio Dotel and Tony Blanco, and a regional governor. And alongside them, scores of merengue music-lovers and P\u00e9rez fans also died in the collapse.\nFor now, the authorities' focus remains on the recovery operation. However, eventually the questions will turn to the cause of the collapse and government investigators will have to provide meaningful answers to the families in due course.\nOne theory is already circulating outside the venue. Many are pointing the finger of blame at a fire at the nightclub around two years ago. Some fear the blaze structurally weakened the site or that any repairs carried out were insufficient or not up to code.\nThe owner of the Jet Set nightclub, Antonio Espaillat, delivered a video message via social media expressing his condolences and those of \"all the Jet Set family\", to the victims' relatives.\nHe also insisted that he and his team were co-operating \"totally and transparently with the authorities\" over the disaster.\nShailyn Pe\u00f1a has heard about the fire at the nightclub and is among those who thinks it played a part. However, for now she has bigger worries. Despite the family's efforts to protect them, her younger stepsisters found out that their father and mother were trapped under the rubble from other children at school.\nThey are \"terrified\", she added.\nIt is Shailyn's birthday on Thursday, a day she would normally celebrate alongside her father, stepmother and aunt.\nInstead, she must endure it in the worst possible circumstances, caught inside the worst such tragedy in her country's modern history.",

Almost a century after he was written into being, F Scott Fitzgerald's doomed romantic has become shorthand for decadent flappers, champagne fountains and never-ending parties. Cut loose by pop culture from the text into which he was born, his name adorns everything from condominiums to hair wax and a limited-edition cologne (it contains notes of vetiver, pink pepper and Sicilian lime). It's now possible to lounge on a Gatsby sofa, check in at the Gatsby hotel, even chow down on a Gatsby sandwich \u2013 essentially a supersize, souped-up chip butty.\nIncongruous though that last item sounds, naming anything after the man formerly known as James Gatz seems more than a touch problematic. After all, flamboyant host is just one part of his complicated identity. He's also a bootlegger, up to his neck in criminal enterprise, not to mention a delusional stalker whose showmanship comes to seem downright tacky. If he embodies the potential of the American Dream, then he also illustrates its limitations: here is a man, let's not forget, whose end is destined to be as pointless as it is violent.\nMisunderstanding has been a part of The Great Gatsby's story from the very start. Grumbling to his friend Edmund Wilson shortly after the novel was published in April 1925, Fitzgerald declared that \"of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about\". Fellow writers like Edith Wharton admired it plenty, but as the critic Maureen Corrigan relates in her book So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures, popular reviewers read it as crime fiction, and were decidedly underwhelmed by it at that. Fitzgerald's Latest A Dud, ran a headline in the New York World. The novel achieved only so-so sales, and by the time of the author's death in 1940, copies of a very modest second print run had long since been remaindered.\nGatsby's luck began to change when it was selected as a giveaway by the US military. With World War Two drawing to a close, almost 155,000 copies were distributed in a special Armed Services Edition, creating a new readership overnight. As the 1950s dawned, the flourishing of the American Dream quickened the novel's topicality, and by the 1960s, it was enshrined as a set text. It's since become such a potent force in pop culture that even those who've never read it feel as if they have, helped along, of course, by Hollywood. It was in 1977, just a few short years after Robert Redford starred in the title role of an adaptation scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, that\u00a0the word \"Gatsbyesque\" was first recorded.\nAlong with Baz Luhrmann's divisive 2013 film extravaganza, the book has spawned graphic novels, an immersive theatrical experience and a television film, broadcast in 2000, with Paul Rudd, Toby Stephens and Mira Sorvino. And since the novel's copyright expired in 2021, enabling anyone to adapt it without permission from its estate, the Gatsby industry has exploded. Early calls for a Muppets adaptation may have come to nothing (never say never), but a musical with songs by Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine opened (and closed) on Broadway last year; a separate, Tony-winning musical, The Great Gatsby, is still running on Broadway and is about to open in London; and author Min Jin Lee and cultural critic Wesley Morris both wrote fresh introductions to 2021 editions of the book.\nIf this all leaves Fitzgerald purists twiddling their pearls like worry beads, it's quite possible that while some such projects may further perpetuate the myth that throwing a Gatsby-themed party could be anything other than sublimely clueless, others may yield fresh insights into a text whose very familiarity often leads us to skate over its complexities. Take, for instance, Michael Farris Smith's new novel, Nick. The title refers, of course, to Nick Carraway, the narrator of Gatsby, who here gets his own fully formed backstory. It's the tale of a Midwesterner who goes off to Europe to fight in World War One and comes back changed, as much by a whirlwind love affair in Paris as by trench warfare. There's room for an impulsive sojourn in the New Orleans underworld before he heads off to Long Island's West Egg.\nLike many, Smith first encountered the novel in high school. \"I just completely didn\u2019t get it\", he tells the BBC, from his home in Oxford, Mississippi. \"They seemed like a lot of people complaining about things they really shouldn't be complaining about.\" It was only when he picked it up again while living abroad in his late 20s that he began to understand the novel's power. \"It was a very surreal reading experience for me. It seemed like something on almost every page was speaking to me in a way I had not expected,\" he recalls.\nReaching the scene in which Carraway suddenly remembers it's his 30th birthday, Smith was filled with questions about what kind of a person Gatsby's narrator really was. \"It seemed to me that there had been some real trauma that had made him so detached, even from his own self. The thought crossed my mind that it would be really interesting if someone were to write Nick's story,\" he says. In 2014, by then a published author in his 40s, he sat down to do just that, telling neither his agent nor his editor. It was only when he delivered the manuscript 10 months later that he learned copyright law meant he'd have to wait until 2021 to publish it.\nSmith points to a quote from one of Fitzgerald's contemporaries as having provided the key to understanding Carraway. \"Ernest Hemingway says in [his memoir] A Moveable Feast that we didn't trust anyone who wasn't in the war, and to me that felt like a natural beginning for Nick.\" Smith imagines Carraway, coping with PTSD and shellshock, returning home to a nation that he no longer recognises. It's a far cry from the riotous razzmatazz of all that partying, yet Carraway is, Smith suggests, the reason Fitzgerald's novel remains read. \"Maybe it's not the champagne and the dancing, maybe it is those feelings of wondering where we are, the sense that anything can crumble at any moment, that keep Gatsby meaningful from one generation to the next.\"\nMore like this:\nWilliam Cain, an expert in American literature and the Mary Jewett Gaiser Professor of English at Wellesley College, agrees that Nick is crucial to understanding the novel's richness. \"Fitzgerald gave some thought to structuring it in the third person but ultimately he chose Nick Carraway, a first-person narrator who would tell Gatsby's story, and who would be an intermediary between us and Gatsby. We have to respond to and understand Gatsby and, as we do so, remain aware that we're approaching him through Nick's very particular perspective, and through Nick's very ambivalent relationship to Gatsby, which is simultaneously full of praise and full of severe criticism, even at some moments contempt,\" he says.\nLike Smith, Cain first encountered the novel as a student. It was a different era \u2013 the 1960s \u2013 but even so, little attention was paid to Nick. Cain recalls instead talk of symbolism \u2013 the legendary green light, for example, and Gatsby's fabled automobile. It's a reminder that, in a way, the education system is as much to blame as pop culture for our limited readings of this seminal text. It may be a Great American Novel but, at fewer than 200 pages, its sublimely economical storytelling makes its study points very easy to access. Ironically, given that this is a novel of illusion and delusion, in which surfaces are crucial, we all too often overlook the texture of its prose. As Cain puts it, \"I think when we consider The Great Gatsby, we need to think about it not just as a novel that is an occasion or a point of departure for us to talk about big American themes and questions, but we have to really enter into the richness of Fitzgerald's actual page-to-page writing. We have to come to Gatsby, yes, aware of its social and cultural significance, but also we need to return to it as a literary experience.\"\nCain re-reads the novel every two or three years but frequently finds himself thinking about it in between \u2013 in 2020, for instance, when US President Biden, accepting the Democratic nomination at the DNC, spoke of the right to pursue dreams of a better future. The American Dream is, of course, another of Gatsby's Big Themes, and one that continues to be misunderstood. \"Fitzgerald shows that that dream is very powerful, but that it is indeed a very hard one for most Americans to realise. It feeds them great hopes, great desires, and it's extraordinary, the efforts that so many of them make to fulfil those dreams and those desires, but that dream is beyond the reach of many, and many, they give up all too much to try to achieve that great success,\" Cain points out. Among the obstacles, Fitzgerald seems to suggest, are hard-and-fast class lines that no amount of money will enable Gatsby to cross. It's a view that resonates with a mood that Cain says he's been picking up on among his students \u2013 a certain \"melancholy\" for the American Dream, the feeling fanned by racial and economic inequalities that the pandemic has only deepened.\nIn other certain respects, the novel hasn't worn quite so well. While Fitzgerald showed where his allegiances lay by highlighting the brute ugliness of Tom Buchanan's white supremacist beliefs, he repeatedly describes African Americans as \"bucks\". The novel makes for frustrating reading from a feminist perspective, too: its female characters lack dimensionality and agency, and are seen instead through the prism of male desire. But the path is now open to endless creative responses to those more dated and unpleasant aspects. Jane Crowther's newly published novel, Gatsby, updates the plot to the 21st Century, and flips the genders to feature a female Jay Gatsby and a male Danny Buchanan. And Claire Anderson-Wheeler's The Gatsby Gambit is a murder mystery which invents a younger sister for Fitzgerald's eponymous anti-hero: Greta Gatsby \u2013 get it?\nTo an impressive degree, however, the renewed attention brought by the copyright expiry and the centenary shows not just how relevant and seductive the text of Fitzgerald's novel remains, but how very alive it's always been. Pick it up at 27, and you'll find a different novel to the one you read as a teenager. Revisit it again at 45, and it'll feel like another book altogether. Copyright has never had any bearing on the impact of the words it governs.\nWhen Smith was finally able to publish Nick in 2021, he returned once more to The Great Gatsby before turning in his last edit. \"I think it will be a novel that's always evolving in my head, and always changing based on who I am,\" he says. \"That's what great novels do.\"\nA version of this article was originally published in 2021.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Maitland-Niles has become one of the leaders at Lyon but Cherki (left) is the young spark in the attack under manager Paulo Fonseca\nAinsley Maitland-Niles can count stars such as Bukayo Saka, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden among his former team-mates but it is young Lyon sensation Rayan Cherki the ex-Arsenal man describes as the \"best natural talent\"  he has ever seen.\nMaitland-Niles and Cherki are part of a resurgent Lyon outfit who face Manchester United in the quarter-final of the Europa League at the Groupama Stadium on Thursday (20:00 BST).\nAs well as Maitland-Niles, Lyon have ex-Premier League players in former Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette and ex-United midfielder Nemanja Matic, plus World Cup winners in France international Corentin Tolisso and Argentina defender Nicolas Tagliafico. \nBut Cherki, 21, is the player that catches the eye and, according to Maitland-Niles, will be a major threat on Thursday night.\n\"He is the best natural talent I've ever seen,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"An absolute master, a wizard with the ball.\"\nCherki has nine goals and 18 assists in 36 games this season across all competitions but individual moments, like his two mazy dribbles to set up Malick Fofana goals against Rangers or his wonderful vision to pick out striker Georges Mikautadze against PSG have made the headlines. \n\"He is taking chances, assists and dragging us up the pitch by taking people on and nutmegging them - he is a genius,\" adds Maitland-Niles.\nOnly three players from Europe's top five leagues - Bruno Fernandes (129), Raphinha (122) and Joshua Kimmich (113) - have created more than Cherki's 103 chances in all competitions this season. And he ranks second in Ligue 1 for completed dribbles with 74, behind Paris St-Germain's Desire Doue with 79.\nThere are also training videos of Cherki with France Under-21s, where he displays equal ability to control and volley a ball with both feet. \n\"He is two-footed, has no fear, keeps going and going, can get past people with such ease, such finesse,\" says Maitland-Niles.\n\"He is now working for the team off the ball and has gone to another level this season.\"\nIn an in-depth interview with BBC Sport, Maitland-Niles also talks about why Arsenal are too reliant on Saka, success under Jose Mourinho at Roma, moving to France and why Lyon will show Manchester United \"respect\". \nMaitland-Niles has been a near ever-present for Lyon and played 34 matches in all competitions this season\nAfter becoming the second youngest Arsenal player to appear in the Champions League, Maitland-Niles thought he would be at his boyhood club his entire life. \nThe defender had been in the Arsenal academy since the age of six and grew up supporting the club but opted to leave on a free transfer to Lyon in 2023. \n\"Life has obviously taken a different turn,\" he says. \"I thought I'd have been in the Premier League my whole career and things obviously didn't go to plan with Arsenal.\n\"But I'm thankful to the club and they didn't put any blockages when it came to leaving. I left as, like most footballers, I wanted to play.\"\nBut why not join another Premier League club? \nHe says: \"I told my agent not to tell me which clubs were interested but just the ones with firm offers. \n\"Lyon were the first to come in and it was such a big club showing their trust and belief in me. It was hard to turn down and it was a good time to try something different. I was at a point where I needed to be shown a lot of love and thought it was a good fit for me. \n\"Of course, I am happy with where I am at this point in time. But who is to say what might come up? In the meantime, I am very happy here and enjoying every moment.\n\"I am still that same player as I was at Arsenal but now with a stronger mindset and more consistency and I know what it takes to succeed.\"\nMaitland-Niles won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2020\nA debut under legendary manager Arsene Wenger, a Europa League final start under Unai Emery in 2019, winning the FA Cup with Mikel Arteta in 2020 and winning five England caps all rank among the major landmarks in Maitland-Niles' journey.\n\"I'm still an Arsenal fan, I watch most of our games and I lived a boyhood dream by winning an FA Cup final at Wembley for the club. [That] was the pinnacle. I supported Arsenal since I was six. I wish them well,\" he adds. \nBut the FA Cup under Arteta, who he regards as a \"tactical genius in Pep Guardiola's mould\", is the last trophy Arsenal have won. \n\"[Arteta] really studied how Pep took football to new heights as one of the best managers in the world,\" he says. \"He really studied how to break down teams and be most effective in games.\n\"Arsenal are showing that at this point, not coming close enough to win the league but you can see they are making big improvements by going close two years in a row.\"\nOn his relationship with Arteta, the defender adds: \"I wouldn't say there was anything special there. I had respect for him as a manager, I thought he was a tactical genius but it was an average player-manager relationship, not especially close.\"\nMaitland-Niles also admits it is \"frustrating\" the club has not followed up that FA Cup success but gives his backing to Arteta, while adding star attacker Saka needs support.\n\"I think they now rely on him a bit too much and you can't expect so much from such a young player,\" he says.\n\"He hasn't even hit his prime yet. But I think he is the driving force of the team and they miss a bit of attacking threat when he is not playing.\n\"Bukayo has become one of the world's best wingers, very consistent, knows how to kill off a game and he can pick his moment in a genius way.\"\nAttacker Ethan Nwaneri, 18, is having his breakthrough this season and could be one option to help Saka.\n\"Physically, he is absolutely incredible and there is no fear in the kid,\" continues Maitland-Niles.  \n\"He is just going at people and trying to make things happen. You can see he is trying to become a leader very early in that team. He is trying to cement his place which is difficult as he plays in the same positions as [Martin] Odegaard and Saka. \n\"But he has got the ability to do so as well. He has the world at his feet and he just needs to take his chance.\"\nAnother landmark for Maitland-Niles was winning the Conference League under Mourinho during a successful six-month loan stint at Roma.\n\"He is a really funny guy,\" says Maitland-Niles. \"The stories Jose gave us about his previous dressing rooms and how he has won cup finals and loads of different leagues - that is an experience you can take something from.\n\"There are a lot of players that would say they love him or hate him. But he is a great guy and what you see is what you get.\"\nMaitland-Niles achieved European success in the Conference League for Jose Mourinho's Roma in 2022\nMaitland-Niles, who is becoming one of the leaders at Lyon, has warned Thursday's Europa League opponents Manchester United that \"people don't realise how big Lyon are\".\n\"We are a historically big club,\" he adds. \"Considering where we were last season, it has been a great year but we need to be addicted to winning, push for more and aim for the Champions League.\"\nMaitland-Niles also says Lyon will try to show Ruben Amorim's United side \"respect but just not too much respect\".\nHe adds: \"They are not having the greatest season but have players like Bruno (Fernandes) and (Christian) Eriksen can run over you if you show too much respect. \n\"We have a great team, great manager and team spirit. We will not be scared, we'll give it our all and believe we can win.\"\nOf course, returning to England for the second leg will also prove exciting.\nHe says: \"As an Englishman, it will be nice to go home. Old Trafford is nothing short of what they call it, the Theatre of Dreams - it can be a dream for you but it can crush your dreams, too.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Double gameweek season has arrived in Fantasy Premier League and it starts with a simple two-team one in gameweek 32.\nIt means a lot of FPL players will have similar teams - or at least similar players who double - but there are still plenty of questions to ponder.\nShould I bench boost? Should I play the Triple Captain chip? And which Crystal Palace and Newcastle players are the best picks?\nOur team of the week should help you with a few of those dilemmas.\nSet your calendar reminders for Friday 11 April when expert FPL Heisenberg is a special guest on the BBC Sport website for a live FPL question and answer session at 15:30 BST.\nThe next few weeks look like this:\nGameweek 32 - double gameweek for Newcastle and Crystal Palace\nGameweek 33 - double gameweek for Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal Palace\nGameweek 34 - blank gameweek for Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal Palace\nGameweek 35 - normal gameweek\nAnd we know the FA Cup final might bring more doubles in 36 and blanks in 37.\nYou've got a massive chance for big points, especially if you've kept a few of your chips back.\nA bench boost would work this week or next. It's obviously team dependant and I'd plan out your squad for both weeks and decide which one feels the most exciting. You're not going to get a full squad of players going twice in either week, so a lot will depend on your single gameweek players.\nNottingham Forest, Brighton and Chelsea players look good this week.\nIn gameweek 33, Liverpool visit Leicester and you could put in West Ham and Manchester United players against Southampton and Wolves respectively.\nIf you haven't yet used your wildcard, now could be the time to set you up for two double gameweeks.\nPicking when you are going to play your Triple Captain chip might be a good way of setting your strategy for the rest of the season - and deciding when Bench Boost is played.\nI think there are three main choices.\n1. Newcastle's Alexander Isak this week - safe, high-upside, but lots of players will make the same decision so if you are chasing points look elsewhere.\n2. Arsenal's Bukayo Saka in week 33 - Ipswich away and Palace at home is juicy, Saka can easily put back-to-back hauls together. But will he start both games?\n3. Wait for week 36 - your hope is Manchester City get to the FA Cup final as one of their games in a potential double would be Southampton away. It's risky waiting this long but could well pay off.\nCaptain Isak did not pay off, with no goal contributions in a 3-0 Newcastle win. \nSaka and fellow Arsenal forward Gabriel Martinelli being benched also hurt.\nBut Jacob Murphy (16 points) and Liam Delap (8) saved the day for 47 points.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nMatz Sels has 11 bonus points to go with his 13 clean sheets this season\nMatz Sels, Nottingham Forest, keeper, \u00a35.1m - Everton (h)\nThe top-scoring keeper, the second-most clean sheets in the league (13) and a home game against a hardly-prolific Everton side.\nYou don't need underlying statistics to back up this pick but here is one anyway - Everton's expected goals (xG) on the road (14.18) is lower than every other team, except Leicester and Southampton, who are both set for relegation.\nNeco Williams, Nottingham Forest, \u00a34.4m - Everton (h)\nDoubling up on a top FPL defence this week. You might look at the points total and think Nikola Milenkovic (\u00a35.1m) is the best Forest asset, having scored four goals.\nBut Williams is the underlying data pick. Since gameweek 25, Milenkovic has scored twice from four shots, two of which were on target.\nWilliams, by contrast, leads the team with 10 shots, seven key passes, one big chance created and an xG of 0.55.\nMilenkovic is a threat from corners, but Williams has more avenues to points from open play.\nDaniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, \u00a35.2m - Man City and Newcastle (both a)\nIf Munoz isn't in your team already then what have you been doing? He's more of a right winger than a defender, and only Manchester City's Josko Gvardiol has more shots in the box, goals and big chances as a defender.\nPalace's double doesn't scream clean sheets, but Munoz doesn't need those!\nKieran Trippier, Newcastle, \u00a35.6m - Man Utd and Crystal Palace (both h)\nIf you can afford him, Trippier is worth the punt as a Newcastle defender. \nFellow full-back Tino Livramento hauled last week, but that was his first assist of the season. Trippier could be taking free-kicks and corners - he's been there and done it as an FPL legend so how about a trip down memory lane?\nKaoru Mitoma has seven goals and four assists this season\nKaoru Mitoma, Brighton, \u00a36.5m - Leicester (h)\nBacking a forward player against Leicester pays off almost every week and Mitoma is easily Brighton's most reliable midfielder.\nThe most shots, shots in the box, on target, key passes, xG, goals - I could go on.\nNewcastle's Murphy had a haul from the flanks against the Foxes, now it is Mitoma's turn.\nMohamed Salah, Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - West Ham (h)\nIt is now three scoreless games in the past four for Salah, but the question is 'what would you do with the money if you sold him?'.\nWest Ham at home is a good fixture and Salah can play terribly and still get two returns in any game. So unless you are in a major budget crunch for double gameweek players just hang on to the Egyptian!\nCole Palmer, Chelsea, \u00a310.7m - Ipswich (h)\nI don't blame you if you've been scared off by Palmer's form and last week's benching, but this fixture is too enticing to ignore him.\nLeaving him on the bench against Brentford didn't exactly work out for manager Enzo Maresca so I'd expect him to play - and Ipswich have conceded more than two goals per game.\nIn a normal gameweek, Palmer would be a captaincy shout.\nJacob Murphy, Newcastle, \u00a35.1m - Man Utd and Crystal Palace (both h)\nAnthony Gordon's recent injury makes the pick of a Newcastle midfielder for the double gameweek a simple one.\nCheap, guaranteed minutes, on form and the winger has 16 goal involvements (GI) this season, which works out at 0.79 GI per 90 minutes on the pitch.\nEberechi Eze (vice-captain), Crystal Palace, \u00a36.8m - Man City and Newcastle (both a)\nPalace's double is not great but you have to take a punt and picking Eze over Ismaila Sarr (\u00a35.7m) depends on how much you value underlying data - and what you take from it.\nSarr has more FPL points this season and his 17 big chances is bettered by only five midfielders - two of them the pricey Salah and Palmer.\nThe Eagles forward also has seven goals from an xG of 7.3, while Eze has two from an xG of 6.1 - so the more expensive Palace man is massively underperforming and perhaps 'due' a goal.\nHe's taken nearly double the shots on goal too, while Sarr's xG in the past two games is zero.\nUltimately, there's no correct choice here and budget might dictate who you choose.\nThis video can not be played\nPsychologists, free hits and the Masters\nAlexander Isak (captain), Newcastle, \u00a39.5m - Man Utd and Crystal Palace (both h)\nA simple choice for captain this week.

        "summary": "You're not going to get a full squad of players going twice in either week, so a lot will depend on your single gameweek players.Nottingham Forest, Brighton and Chelsea players look good this week.In gameweek 33, Liverpool visit Leicester and you could put in West Ham and Manchester United players against Southampton and Wolves respectively.If you haven't yet used your wildcard, now could be the time to set you up for two double gameweeks.Should I play the FPL Triple Captain chip in week 32?Picking when you are going to play your Triple Captain chip might be a good way of setting your strategy for the rest of the season - and deciding when Bench Boost is played.I think there are three main choices.1. So unless you are in a major budget crunch for double gameweek players just hang on to the Egyptian!Cole Palmer, Chelsea, \u00a310.7m - Ipswich (h)I don't blame you if you've been scared off by Palmer's form and last week's benching, but this fixture is too enticing to ignore him.Leaving him on the bench against Brentford didn't exactly work out for manager Enzo Maresca so I'd expect him to play - and Ipswich have conceded more than two goals per game.In a normal gameweek, Palmer would be a captaincy shout.Jacob Murphy, Newcastle, \u00a35.1m - Man Utd and Crystal Palace (both h)Anthony Gordon's recent injury makes the pick of a Newcastle midfielder for the double gameweek a simple one.Cheap, guaranteed minutes, on form and the winger has 16 goal involvements (GI) this season, which works out at 0.79 GI per 90 minutes on the pitch.Eberechi Eze (vice-captain), Crystal Palace, \u00a36.8m - Man City and Newcastle (both a)Palace's double is not great but you have to take a punt and picking Eze over Ismaila Sarr (\u00a35.7m) depends on how much you value underlying data - and what you take from it.Sarr has more FPL points this season and his 17 big chances is bettered by only five midfielders - two of them the pricey Salah and Palmer.The Eagles forward also has seven goals from an xG of 7.3, while Eze has two from an xG of 6.1 - so the more expensive Palace man is massively underperforming and perhaps 'due' a goal.He's taken nearly double the shots on goal too, while Sarr's xG in the past two games is zero.Ultimately, there's no correct choice here and budget might dictate who you choose.StrikersThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Psychologists, free hits and the MastersAlexander Isak (captain), Newcastle, \u00a39.5m - Man Utd and Crystal Palace (both h)A simple choice for captain this week. And which Crystal Palace and Newcastle players are the best picks?Our team of the week should help you with a few of those dilemmas.Set your calendar reminders for Friday 11 April when expert FPL Heisenberg is a special guest on the BBC Sport website for a live FPL question and answer session at 15:30 BST.Bench Boost in gameweek 32?The next few weeks look like this:Gameweek 32 - double gameweek for Newcastle and Crystal PalaceGameweek 33 - double gameweek for Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal PalaceGameweek 34 - blank gameweek for Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal PalaceGameweek 35 - normal gameweekAnd we know the FA Cup final might bring more doubles in 36 and blanks in 37.You've got a massive chance for big points, especially if you've kept a few of your chips back.A bench boost would work this week or next. Since gameweek 25, Milenkovic has scored twice from four shots, two of which were on target.Williams, by contrast, leads the team with 10 shots, seven key passes, one big chance created and an xG of 0.55.Milenkovic is a threat from corners, but Williams has more avenues to points from open play.Daniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, \u00a35.2m - Man City and Newcastle (both a)If Munoz isn't in your team already then what have you been doing? Scored a lovely goal last week, and was motoring before his recent head injury with eight goals in an eight-game stretch.And if you watched Mateta in the win over Brighton, his finish oozed confidence and he looks ready to hit top gear.Subs benchBart Verbruggen, Brighton, keeper, \u00a34.5m - Leicester (h)Pervis Estupinan, Brighton, defender, \u00a34.9m - Leicester (h)Jakub Kiwior, Arsenal, defender, \u00a34.8m - Brentford (h)Iliman Ndiaye, Everton, striker, \u00a35.2m - Nottingham Forest (a)Team total cost: \u00a399.9mThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.Player to watchImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mikel Merino has earned bonus points on each of the five occasions he has scoredMikel Merino, Arsenal, midfielder, \u00a36.1mAre FPL players sleeping on the Spaniard?",

I'm training harder than I've ever trained now because they're in the back of my mind,\" Pimblett tells BBC Sport. \n\"I need to look after them for the rest of my life, I need to put food on the table so yeah, it's changed me.\n\"All the people closest to me have said it and to be honest, I know they're not gonna lie.\"\nLiverpool's Pimblett has been training for the next big test of his career when he faces American lightweight Michael Chandler at UFC 314 in Miami, Florida on Saturday.\nMurphy outclasses Emmett to stay unbeaten in UFC\nUFC win was 15 years in the making - McKee\nPimblett says he has been in the gym almost \"every day\" since his statement first-round submission win over Bobby Green in July,  preparing for Chandler, but has also had more time to adjust to parenthood.\nBecause Pimblett's daughters are identical, the 30-year-old would sometimes get them mixed up, so he's figured out a way to tell them apart.\n\"There's only little things that help me tell the difference but one of the big things is Margot has a bangle on her left hand and Betty has a bangle on her right hand,\" he adds.\nPimblett responds with trademark humour when he is asked what he has learned since becoming a dad.\n\"Try and just have one baby, twins are hard work,\" jokes Pimblett.\n\"One of us can't just put them to bed, both of us have to be there.

He wants people to know that he's edgy and dark and I'm, I don't know, like I watch reality TV.\"\nWhite continued: \"We never really even fought. He says we feuded. I don't think I ever had a fight with him \u2013 except for maybe some emails.\"\nWhite continued: \"It was basically me giving him notes. I don't think he liked to go through the process of getting notes from me, or wanting revisions, because he didn't respect me. \n\"I knew he wasn't a team player and that he wanted to do it his way.

The Independent agreed it was a \"a violent end to a bad season\", while the Standard said it was \"heartwarming, frequently heartbreaking and, often, frustrating\".\nThe Telegraph was more positive, awarding the last episode four stars and describing it as \"a dark, uncomfortable finale, but one that forced the audience to ponder the very meaning of happiness\".\nThe latest season starred British actors Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood alongside Walton Goggins, Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Parker Posey. \nSunday's final episode was watched by 6.2 million viewers in the US. \nIn the UK, the show has been attracting about 1.5 million viewers per episode, including catch-up.\nIt has also received huge pick-up on social media, with some scenes being made into memes and gifs, while fans have speculated on relationships between cast members.",

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.\nBut now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.\nThe White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \n\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.\nThat framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. \nSo was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?\nIt didn't take long for Trump's aides \u2013 many of the same people who said he would never back down \u2013 to fan out and celebrate the president's move.\nTrade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\".\n\"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\"\nThey were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?\nUltimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.\nEarlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. \nIn the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.\nHe insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".\n\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.\nIn the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. \nThe reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. \nIt is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.\nThat will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions.\nThe big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week \u2013 setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order \u2013 will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. \nAnd in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.\nIt looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.\nIt is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.\nScientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.\nThe development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.\nBut what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.\nA lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.\nFor a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.\n\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"\nChildren who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains. \n\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"\nDuring the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.\nKey to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.\n\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"\nThis skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school. \n\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"\nIn another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.\nA research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.\n\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.\n\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"\nThe study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.\nThe Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.\nThe project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.\nOne study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.\nThanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.\nAnd the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.\nIn this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.\nEmily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.\n\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"\nHelping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.\n\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"\nHenry and Jackson finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.\n\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to. \n\"Why wouldn't you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "The Williams brothers bring pace and direct running to Athletic Bilbao's attack\nEuropa League quarter-final, first leg: Rangers v Athletic Bilbao\nVenue: Ibrox Stadium, Glasgow Date: Thursday, 10 April Kick-off: 20:00 BST\nCoverage: Listen on BBC Radio Scotland Extra & Sounds, plus follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app\nWhen Nico Williams led England a merry dance on a balmy summer's night in Berlin last July, it capped the season of his dreams. Now he is determined to do similar damage to Rangers and keep Athletic Bilbao on course for their first European trophy.\nIn the space of 100 days, Williams produced two showpiece man-of-the-match performances.\nFirst, he helped end Bilbao's four-decade wait for silverware, then he opened the scoring for Spain in the German capital as his country won their fourth European Championship title.\nFans and the game's biggest clubs across the continent gazed lovingly at this football maverick, who exploded onto the scene a few seasons ago but whose stock has risen 10-fold in the past 12 months. \nThat ascent began with his role in winning last year's Copa Del Rey, Athletic Club's first success since a league and cup double in 1984.\nBorn in Pamplona, Williams regularly acknowledges the life he has been afforded came despite his parents' struggles in Ghana before they fled for Spain.\nAfter placing his Euro 2024 winners' medal round his mother's neck, he said: \"I run fast, but not as fast as my mother. She escaped death and crossed the Sahara from Ghana to Spain. I gave her my medal because she deserves it more.\"\nIt seems that the humble Williams will have his pick when it comes to his next club, with Arsenal the latest to be heavily linked with his services.\nNot that he is in a rush to leave Bilbao. They are his club. \n\"I was the first one to cry, you can't even imagine what this feels like,\" he said after their historic Spanish Cup win against Mallorca in Seville's Cartuja. \n\"It's a dream to win with the club of my life,\" he said.\nFor the club it was monumental, coming after no fewer than seven straight cup final defeats, including in the 2012 Europa League.\nThe coronavirus pandemic meant they wrote unwanted history in 2021, losing two Copa del Rey finals in the space of two weeks to Basque rivals Real Sociedad and then Barcelona.\nThe tactical & mental reasons behind Jekyll and Hyde Rangers\nFerguson hopes 'long chat' bears fruit v Bilbao\n'Top-class Butland making too many regular mistakes'\nMaking their eventual success all the sweeter for Williams was the fact his older brother Inaki \u2013 who represents the country of his parents \u2013 was alongside him in the Bilbao team.\nWith Bilbao hosting this season's Europa League final at the impressive Estadio San Mames, the Williams brothers are doubly determined to brush Rangers aside and take a big step closer to the reality of winning the trophy on their own patch.\nAs Jose Mourinho was at pains to point out as he gazed upon the burning ashes of Fenerbahce's shoot-out defeat at Ibrox, Athletic Club are big favourites to move into a semi-final against Lyon or Manchester United.\nWith Nico and Inaki, who have both scored five Europa League goals this season, on the flanks, manager Ernesto Valverde has potency at the top of the pitch in addition to the joint-best defence in La Liga at his disposal.\n\"This title is unlike any other,\" said Valverde - in his third spell in charge of the club - when they lifted the Copa del Rey. \nHowever they could top that in six weeks' time.\nHaving overcome Roma in the last 16, the former Barcelona and Olympiacos coach is determined to build on last season's cup win with another trophy.\nChampions League football next season is also within sight with the club sitting fourth in the Spanish top flight.\nNico's Spain team-mate Oihan Sancet, their top scorer in the league this season, has made a timely return to the fold after a thigh problem. He made a cameo appearance from the bench during their goalless draw at Villareal on Sunday.\nKey defender Dani Vivian, with the Copa del Rey trophy that ended Athletic Club's drought\nThat was a second stalemate in succession, but one which prevented their closest challengers for that final La Liga Champions League spot from making up ground.\nSpain's number one Unai Simon will sit Thursday's game out as Athletic Club's number two Julen Agirrezabala plays in their European matches. \nHowever, you realise that is not a big downgrade when you see the crucial saves he made against Mallorca - including in the penalty shoot-out that decided the King's Cup's destination a year ago.\nThere are doubts over the fitness of centre-back Aitor Paredes but Valverde is hopeful he will take his usual position beside the rock-solid Dani Vivian at the heart of the Bilbao backline.\nRangers may take a degree of optimism from the fact Bilbao are not in red-hot form though. They have won two of their last seven games and scored just once in their last three.\nHowever, this is a step up in class for Barry Ferguson's men and, thanks largely to the Williams brothers, The Lions have rediscovered their roar.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

        "article_text": "Chef Ruben Bond\u00ec knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church, in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving \u2013 and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bond\u00ec, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, the tradizione giudaico-romanesca (Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset of Roman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bond\u00ec, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Maurizio Fiorino)\nRuben Bond\u00ec is a Roman chef and food influencer whose cooking videos have earned him more than four million followers on social media. In 2023, he published a cookbook on Jewish Roman cuisine, Cucina con Ruben.\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes \u2013 expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy \u2013 from carciofi alla giudia (fried artichokes) to stracotto (braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing \u2013 typical [Jewish] dishes like concia di zucchine [marinated fried courgettes] and abbacchio [roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history \u2013 from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 \u2013 Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so] the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto \u2013 sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace \u2013 is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bond\u00ec's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae \u2013 the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol \u2013 Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\nDon't get your artichokes off-season\nWhile artichokes may be the undeniable star of the Roman Jewish kitchen, Bond\u00ec recommends visitors only consume the vegetable when it's in harvest. \"Avoid getting artichokes when they're off-season,\" he advises. \"You won't be served Italian artichokes, and they won't be as fresh. You should only get them when it's artichoke season, so from November-December to May.\"\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples is carciofi alla giudia \u2013 a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes like spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches in Venice, Florence and Milan. Its main restaurant \u2013 a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures \u2013 does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearby Ba'Ghetto Milky.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram: @baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institution Renato al Ghetto \u2013 where Bond\u00ec worked as a waiter in his younger days \u2013 realised it could replicate its success with street food, its\u00a0hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosette are a type of Roman bap,\" Bond\u00ec says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beef stracotto or Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chicken alla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under \u20ac12 (\u00a310).\n\"It's very good,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S. Maria del Pianto, 63, 00186\nPhone: +39 338 859 3395\nInstagram: @rosetteria_renato_al_ghetto\n\"Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,\" Ruben says. \"And for meat lovers, I recommend BellaCarne.\"\nLocated a mere block from the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, the restaurant's name itself is particularly promising \u2013 translating literally to \"Beautiful Meat\" \u2013 and its dishes definitely live up to expectations.\n\"I can especially vouch for their grilled meats,\" Bond\u00ec says, which include scottadito lamb and veal chops.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut while meat in all its forms \u2013 roast, fried, stewed and braised \u2013 is the undeniable star, it isn't the only thing worth ordering.\n\"They have an excellent vegan crostata [tart] for dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says, made with almond paste and sour cherries.\nRoman Jewish food may be humble by nature, but BellaCarne offers a decidedly refined dining experience, set in a chic, wood-panelled interior.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump announced a massive tariff plan last week that would have upended the global economic order as well as long-established trading relationships with America's allies. \nBut that plan - or at least a significant part of it - is on ice after the president suspended higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days while leaning into a trade war with China.\nSo with this partial reversal, is Trump any closer to realising his goals on trade? Here's a quick look at five of his key ambitions and where they now stand.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike\nTrump's original trade plan packed a big punch that landed around the world, with a flat 10% baseline tariff on everyone (including some uninhabited islands) and additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on the 60 counties that he said were the worst offenders.\nIt sent allies and adversaries scrambling, as they stared down the prospect of a debilitating blow to their economies.\nThe White House has been quick to boast about all the world leaders who have reached out to the president to make deals and offer trade concessions \u2013 \"more than 75\", according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nAlthough the administration hasn't released a list of all the countries that Trump said on Tuesday were \"kissing my ass\" and promising to do anything, the US has announced it is in negotiations with South Korea and Japan, among others.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: America's trading partners have 90 days to strike some sort of agreement with Trump, and the clock is ticking. But the fact that talks are happening indicates that the president has a good chance of getting something for his efforts.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country\u2026We will supercharge our domestic industrial base.\nTrump has said for decades that tariffs are an effective way of rebuilding America's manufacturing base by shielding it from unfair foreign competition. While some factories may be able to increase production in current facilities, more substantive efforts take time. And for business leaders to pull the trigger on \"reshoring\" their production lines and investing in new US factories, they will want to know that the rules of the game are relatively stable.\nThe president's on-again, off-again tariff moves over the past week are inherently unstable, however. For the moment, it's difficult to predict where the final tariff levels will land and which industries will receive the greatest protections. It could be car manufacturers and steel producers today, and high-tech electronics companies tomorrow.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: When tariffs are applied and removed seemingly at the president's whim, it's much more likely that companies \u2013 both in the US and abroad \u2013 will hunker down and wait for the dust to settle before making any big commitments.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: I have great respect for President Xi of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us.\nAfter Trump's tariff about-face on Wednesday, several White House officials \u2013 including Treasury Secretary Bessent - were quick to say that Trump's goal was to drop the hammer on the real villain, China.\n\"They are the biggest source of the US trade problems,\" Bessent told reporters, \"and indeed they are the problem for the rest of the world.\nIf Trump wanted a battle of wills with China, testing each side's tolerance for economic and political pain, he got one \u2013 even if the president and his aides have hinted that they are looking for an exit ramp.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said that he blamed past US leaders, not China, for the current trade dispute. The prior day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would be \"incredibly gracious\" if China reaches out to make a deal.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Even if this showdown is one Trump wants, picking a fight with the second-largest economy in the world, with military power to match, comes at enormous risk. And along the way America may have alienated the allies it needs most in such a confrontation.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly.\nDuring last year's presidential campaign, Trump regularly touted that his proposed tariffs would bring in vast sums in new revenue, which the US could then use to shrink its budget deficit, fund tax cuts and pay for new government programmes.\nA study last year by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff \u2013 which is what Trump has landed on for at least the next 90 days \u2013 would generate $2tn in new revenue over the next 10 years.\nTo put that in context, the tax cuts Congress recently included in its non-binding budget blueprint would cost approximately $5tn over the next 10 years, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Trump wanted more tariff revenue, and if he sticks with his baseline tariffs, plus the additional levies on certain imports and larger ones on China, he's going to get it \u2013 at least until Americans switch to more domestic production, when the tariff money gusher could turn to a trickle.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will be indeed the golden age of America.\nAnalysts and experts have offered a grab bag of other explanations about why Trump made such an aggressive move on trade last week. Was he trying to drive down interest rates, or devalue the US dollar or bring the world to the table for a new, global agreement on trade? The president himself hasn't spoken much about those kinds of elaborate schemes.\nOne thing he has talked about relentlessly, however, is his desire to lower costs for American consumers - and he has promised that his trade policy will help address this. While energy prices dipped in the week since Trump announced his tariff plan, that may have been a result of fears that the trade wars could trigger a global recession. \nThe consensus among economists is that new tariffs will drive up consumer prices, as tariffs are tacked on to the price of imports and, eventually, when there is less competition for US-made products. Last year, the Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff would increase costs for American households by an average of $1,253 in its first year. Economists also warn that lower-income Americans will be hardest hit. \nTHE TAKEAWAY: An increase in prices is an arrow moving in the wrong direction \u2013 and it represents an enormous potential liability for both Trump's political standing and his party's future electoral prospects.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

It brought only more disappointment as Europe's biggest trophy continued to evade PSG.\nThe return to common sense rather than chasing instant results has seen PSG acquire new jewels in their crown such as Doue and Kvaratskhelia. They are now an outstanding team, not simply a collection of superstar individuals.\nThe pair cost \u00a3102m (120m euro) but are talents for now and the future, unlike the \u00a3200m spent signing Neymar from Barcelona in 2017 and the mega-money given to Messi when he 34.\nIt even enabled Luis Enrique to keep the talented Bradley Barcola on the bench.\nDesire Doue translates to 'desire gifted' in English. He has vast reserves of both as Villa found out to their cost ,running them ragged on the flanks, equalising with a sensational curling finish high past a motionless Martinez from 20 yards on an angle.\nThere are rough edges to be smoothed out on the teenager, who drew the ire of France coach Didier Deschamps when he turned up late for his first day with the national squad at their Clairefontaine base before making his debut against Croatia.\nBut he is not short of confidence, stepping forward to score the winning penalty against Liverpool in the shootout at Anfield in the last round.\nDoue's idol is Neymar but he is making a name of his own following his \u00a343m (50m euro) arrival from Rennes last summer.\nWilliam takes eldest son George to watch Villa in Paris\nMendes' late strike puts PSG in control against Villa\n'We believe in Villa Park' - can Emery's men rescue tie?\nThis video can not be played\nDoue 'unleashes a brilliant finish' to bring PSG level\nPSG beat Bayern Munich to Doue's signature based on last season at Rennes. He scored four goals and had four assists in 31 Ligue 1 appearances with 17 starts last term, but also created 27 chances from open play.\nThis season he has reached another level, having created the most open play chances per 90 minutes of anyone in Europe's top five leagues - 2.6 based on having played a minimum of 750 minutes.\nThis term, among midfielders and forwards, only Ousmane Dembele (13.5) has averaged more progressive ball carries than his 12.4 per 90 minutes in Ligue 1.\nDoue has an impressive 22 goal involvements this season at a rate of one every 105.8 minutes, evenly split into 11 goals and 11 assists. Only Dembele (39) and Barcola (33) have contributed to more goals for PSG this season.\nHe has scored in each of his past four appearances for PSG in all competitions with five goals, and now has 13 goal involvements in his past 12 games, with eight goals and five assists.\nDoue is a free spirit in possession with a devastating turn of pace and glorious touch, and has a golden future.\nAlongside him, and a constant threat to Villa, was 24-year-old Kvaratskhelia, whose occasionally languid, jinking style cannot disguise the sort of natural gifts that saw him earn the nickname 'Kvaradona' when he came to prominence at Diego Maradona's former club Napoli. There, he tormented Liverpool when Jurgen Klopp's team were beaten 4-1 in Italy in the Champions League in 2021.\nHe troubled Matty Cash throughout the first half before the defender was substituted, but his replacement Axel Disasi was outmanoeuvred instantly by the Georgian, twisting and turning the defender before unleashing an unstoppable shot high past Martinez.\nAdd in Dembele, who is finally fulfilling all that was predicted for him when he was at Barcelona, and PSG currently have claim to be Europe's best team.\nThey thrashed Manchester City 4-2 here in the new league table format stage, then recovered from losing at home to a late Liverpool smash-and-grab before winning at Anfield and going through on penalties.\nNow, at last, there is real belief that PSG are finally ready to put their years of Champions League suffering behind them and win Europe's elite trophy.\nPSG are a joy to watch under Luis Enrique, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, and the vast bowl of Parc des Princes is a cauldron of noise and expectation.\nThere was even a nod to Birmingham-based TV series Peaky Blinders for Villa before kick-off, when a giant tifo emblazoned with a skull wearing a flat cap bearing the message \"By Order Of The PSG SG Fans\" was unfurled.\nPSG delivered in style, running Villa ragged as Unai Emery made an unhappy return to the club where he spent two seasons.

She said the doll celebrates \"LeBron as a role model,\" his ability as an icon to transcend culture and set a \"positive example for the next generation.\"\nThe doll features the Los Angeles Lakers basketball player in his pre-game fashion and reflects his height - it's an inch taller than the standard Ken doll. \nIn reality, the athlete is 6ft 9in tall.\nThe new doll comes as the company is facing financial uncertainty amid President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China, where just under 40% of Mattel's production is based.\nTrump announced on Wednesday that tariffs on goods from China would increase to 125%. He accused Beijing of a \"lack of respect\" after it retaliated and said it would impose tariffs of 84% on US imports.\nIn the same announcement, Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs and authorised a universal \"lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%\" as negotiations continued with roughly 60 countries. \nMattel has said it may have to increase prices and possibly implement changes to its supply chain. Consumer and business groups in the US have warned that the tariffs may disrupt supply chains and lead to higher prices.\nThe new Ken doll doesn't show the athlete in his basketball uniform. Instead, he's dressed in a varsity jacket adorned with \"LJ\" on the front. \nIt includes an Ohio patch and a crown patch on one sleeve and the number 23 - his basketball jersey number - on the other. On the back, \"LeBron\" is boldly printed along with the phrase, \"Just a kid from Akron\" - the Ohio city where he was born. \nUnder the jacket, the doll wears a shirt that reads \"We Are Family,\" a nod to the star's foundation. The doll includes accessories like a basketball, headphones and sneakers.\nIn a promotional video released by Mattel, Mr James reacted to see the doll for the first time. \"Oh, he dope!\" he says as he's given the figurine. \"That's so cool!\" \nAs he toyed with the doll's accessories, he joked the LeBron Ken doll \"might have to do a little lifting, legs are looking skinny\". \nThe move is a significant moment for the 65-year-old Barbie brand, which has made a push in recent years to diversify its dolls and reflect a broader range of careers, body types and backgrounds.\nThough Barbie has previously honoured athletes like Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and Megan Rapinoe, Mr James is the first male sports figure - and the first male figure not from the entertainment industry - to join the lineup.\nEven with four NBA titles, two Olympic gold medals, and a scoring record to his name, Mr James says his new title of \"Kenbassador\" hits differently\u2014because it's about more than basketball.\n\"It's an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness.\"",

        "article_text": "A Gavin and Stacey star has admitted he felt \"relief\" when the series came to an end.\nLarry Lamb opened up about how playing Mick Shipman on the hit sitcom changed his personality and was the \"most extraordinary experience\" of his life.\nThe 77-year-old actor spoke about the influences and adventures that led to his performing career spanning more than four decades.\n\"Now that it's all done, there's a sense of relief and a sense of contentment,\" he told Kate Thornton on her podcast, White Wine Question Time, released on Friday.\nBut he did not rule out revisiting Mick in a potential Gavin and Stacey film: \"Who knows? Never say never.\"\nDuring the episode, Lamb - who speaks five languages and worked in selling encyclopaedias and in the energy industry before embarking on acting - opened up about everything from his \"difficult and unhappy\" childhood, to his most recent endeavor of writing his debut novel.\nGavin and Stacey, which was co-written by Ruth Jones and James Corden and began in 2007, followed the story of a girl from south Wales and a boy from Essex who fell in love, and the ups and downs of their worlds colliding.\nThe series officially ended with a grand finale Christmas Day episode last year.\n\"It was the most extraordinary experience of my life, going through the whole of that and then, particularly, that end. It was just amazing,\" said Lamb, who played Gavin's father Mick.\n\"I was never convinced that it was going to be the end [but] now that it's all done... I feel no frustration about wanting to go on with it.\"\nThe record-breaking Gavin and Stacey finale has bagged an array of Bafta nominations, including one for the Memorable Moment Award.\nThe wedding scene, and in particular when Corden's character Smithy waits for Mick's opinion on whether he should go through with marrying his fianc\u00e9 Sonia, really hit home with fans.\n\"Fifty years as an actor, and I have a scene where I don't say anything and all I do is stand up. I get more feedback off that than I have in fifty years of acting,\" said Lamb.\n\"Playing the King in Hamlet, TV series, musicals and [I just needed to] stand up,\" he joked.\nLamb admitted Mick Shipman developed into a character he himself wanted to be, unlike some of his other roles.\n\"You certainly wouldn't want to be Archie Mitchell [in EastEnders], you'd spend your life trying to get shot of him.\"\nHe said filming for Gavin and Stacey originally began as we was entering his 60s and \"was just beginning to calm down and become a bit more of a regular, run-of-the-mill human being\".\n\"Wild days were over and I'd stopped drinking,\" he said.\n\"Dear old Mick came along and so I played Mick through my sixties and into my seventies. I began to take Mick on board. I certainly didn't realise I was taking Mick on board, I was just a much more bearable person to be around and much more bearable for me to live with.\n\"I remember George, my boy, saying to me, 'you're an old geezer now, you better start learning to enjoy it' and that's what I started to do.\"\nHe said Mick was \"a happy go-lucky guy\" who dealt with problems as they cropped up but \"always looked on the bright side\" and enjoyed life.\nHe added Mick had to \"learn how to be a diplomat\" while living with \"Mrs chaos\" - his eccentric wife, Pam - but that the couple were \"absolutely madly in love\".\n\"There's nothing that's going to rock their boat\u2026 what they wrote was this absolutely perfect couple who know how to work around each other, no matter what goes on.\"\nLamb said he definitely wanted to keep working, but was often not the \"first choice\" for parts, because casting directors knew people saw him as Mick Shipman.\n\"Characters like Mick Shipman are pretty difficult to act your way around,\" he said.\n\"But I've done a few things over the last year where I play somebody's dad or the older part of it and they're not massive commitments time wise but what they are is interesting jobs, interesting relationships.\n\"Those sort of parts are attractive to me.\"",

Researchers have also been investigating environmental factors.\nThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH), a government agency, spends more than $300m (\u00a3230m) per year researching autism. \nThe NIH lists some possible risk factors including prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, premature birth or low birth weight, maternal health problems and parents conceiving at older ages.\nKennedy did not give details on the research project or how much funding will be devoted to autism research. \nSince being sworn in two months ago, the former environmental lawyer has slashed the budget for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which includes the NIH, CDC and other government health organisations that oversee food and drug safety and conduct disease research.\n\"We're going to look at vaccines, but we're going to look at everything,\" Kennedy later said during an interview with Fox News about the scope of the undertaking. \"Everything is on the table, our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic.\"\nIn a statement the Autism Society of America called Kennedy's plan \"harmful, misleading, and unrealistic\".\n\"It is neither a chronic illness nor a contagion,\" the society said.\nChristopher Banks, the society's president, questioned whether the research efforts would be transparent and said claims that autism is solely caused by environmental factors were \"misleading theories (which) perpetuate harmful stigma, jeopardize public health, and distract from the critical needs of the autism community.\"\nKennedy has also alarmed some over his hiring of David Geier, who has been described by some as a conspiracy theorist, to research vaccines and autism, and on Thursday Democrats in the US House of Representatives wrote to HHS  \"to express our urgent concern\" over the selection of \"a biased and discredited individual\". \nGeier is a leading vaccine sceptic who was fined by the state of Maryland for practicing medicine without a medical degree or licence and prescribing dangerous treatments to autistic children.\nThe discredited idea that childhood vaccines are linked to autism first gained mainstream attention after a paper published in 1998 in the medical journal The Lancet by British doctor Andrew Wakefield.\nWakefield was later found to have financial conflicts of interest and the UK's General Medical Council found that he falsified his results.

        "article_text": "Home to three Michelin-starred restaurants and a royal gingerbread legacy, the unassuming Lancashire town of Ormskirk is fast becoming the UK's most delicious destination.\nWhen it comes to UK destinations for a gourmet weekend away, there's a new name on the lips of serious foodies. Forget the metropolitan streets of Chelsea, Mayfair or even Edinburgh. Britain's latest gastronomic hotspot is in the rural hinterlands of deepest Lancashire.\nHolidaymakers journeying to this historic county in north-west England \u2013 a key location in the English and Industrial revolutions \u2013 would have traditionally been heading for Blackpool, the classic British seaside resort whose best-known epicurean delight is Blackpool Rock, a tooth-shatteringly tough cylindrical stick of boiled sugar and glucose syrup.\u00a0\nBut, for those with more refined palates \u2013 or more delicate dental work \u2013 the tastiest rewards are to be found in Ormskirk, a bustling market town that was once a Viking settlement, and in Aughton, the small village next door.\u00a0\nIt's in this small village where Mark Birchall serves as chef patron of Moor Hall, a produce-driven restaurant within the grounds of a Grade II-listed, 16th-Century manor house. And at this year's Michelin awards, he was the only chef in Britain and Ireland to have been awarded a third Michelin star. As such, he has become one of only 10 chefs in the country (and fewer than 150 in the entire world) to hold the three-star accolade, a designation signalling that, according to the tyre company's inspectors, a restaurant is worth making a dedicated journey for.\nNo stranger to recognition, Moor Hall was voted Best Restaurant in England in the 2023 National Restaurant Awards, and also possesses a green Michelin star for the sustainable cooking practices used to create its 18-course tasting menu. Additionally, Birchall's \"neighbourhood restaurant\", The Barn (offering more casual dining at a lower price point), is a mere 30 second stroll around the lake from Moor Hall and possesses a Michelin star of its very own too.\nAs if that weren't enough, less than 10 minutes' walk away is Chef Tim Allen's restaurant s\u014d-l\u014d which has a Michelin star as well, bringing the total to a rather stellar six in the space of less than half a mile.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo what makes the food so special in this part of Lancashire, I ask Birchall as he forages for micro herbs and other ingredients on Moor Hall's six-acre country estate, dotted with secluded luxury garden rooms where diners can stay.\u00a0\n\"Aughton and Ormskirk have a deep-rooted connection to the land, and that plays a massive part in why the food here is so special,\" he tells me. \"The landscape, the soil, the weather \u2013 it all contributes to the quality of the produce. We're lucky to have incredibly fertile, well-draining soil, which means the fruit and vegetables \u2013 particularly leafy greens, brassicas and root veg \u2013 even the grass that feeds the livestock, are all packed with flavour.\"\nIndeed, the West Lancashire coastal plain between Preston and Southport is often referred to as \"the salad bowl of England\". According to the National Farmers Union, England's north-west region accounts for 15% of the country's food production, leading them to call it \"Britain's farming powerhouse\".\n\"The climate, too, plays its role,\" Birchall continues. \"We get just the right balance \u2013 enough rain to keep things abundant, but not so much that it drowns the land. That allows for a longer growing season, and when you combine that with generations of skilled farmers who understand how to work with the land, you get outstanding ingredients. It's that connection between produce and place that really sets the region apart.\"\nAllen agrees with Birchall, with whom he consulted before opening s\u014d-l\u014d. He has seen an influx of foodies not just from London (which is a little more than two hours away by train) but from right across the globe. \"We get people coming from America, Mexico, Norway, Finland, even Singapore,\" Allen tells me.\n\"But also, because we're located midway between Liverpool and Manchester \u2013 whose football teams (Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United) are massive \u2013 you get a lot of people travelling for the football. And many of them, it turns out, quite like eating Michelin-starred food.\"\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, these discerning fans eschew the plastic platefuls of pie and chips usually consumed on the terraces to partake of Allen's altogether more elevated offerings; dishes made with ingredients such as Louet Fessier oyster emulsion, Oscietra caviar and salt-baked celeriac (which he employs somebody to grow purely for s\u014d-l\u014d's seven-course tasting menu).\nBut this part of Lancashire offers more than the ultra-modern cordon bleu cuisine of Moor Hall and s\u014d-l\u014d; travellers in search of the area's deepest culinary roots may find them at the famous Omskirk Market. Held on Thursdays and Saturdays, it is one of the country's oldest (King Edward I granted it a Royal Charter in 1286) and is where you can sample the town's original claim to culinary fame: gingerbread.\nAs far back as 1732, recipes for the spicy baked treat were being passed down through generations of Ormskirkers. Sellers \u2013 almost exclusively women identified by their white shawls and aprons \u2013 would tout fresh gingerbread to passengers on the stagecoaches that stopped at the inns along Aughton Street on their way from Liverpool to Preston. When Ormskirk railway station opened in 1849, the women switched to targeting train passengers.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The English wine that's rivalling Champagne\n\u2022 Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022 The surprising 'lesbian capital of the UK'\n\"They would make their way along the platform, loudly knocking on all the carriage windows crying out 'Gingerbread! Who will buy my freshly baked gingerbread?',\" explains Kathryn MacDonald of the Ormskirk and District Family History Society. \"There were so many of them and they were such persuasive sellers that Ormskirk's gingerbread women became well known around the region. So when, in 1885, the Prince of Wales alighted here \u2013 he was going to a shooting party at nearby Lathom House \u2013 there was a welcome reception put on for him at the station and three of the gingerbread women were allowed to present the Prince with a gift of Ormskirk gingerbread. A few years later, when he became king (Edward VII), he'd stop the royal train at Ormskirk on his way up to Balmoral, and stock up with supplies for himself and the royal family. So, he obviously must have really liked our gingerbread!\"\nThe white-aproned women no longer ply their wares at the station, but one baker of Ormskirk gingerbread can still be found today in the town. Mr Thompson's Bakery is a family business run by Neil Thompson, his wife Janet and daughter Lilli who bake the treats in a converted shed in their back garden.\n\"Back in 2010, we revived an ancient Ormskirk gingerbread recipe but made some tweaks, such as using less salt, to suit modern tastes,\" says Lilli, who mans their stall each week at Ormskirk's famous food market.\nThe Thompsons' bakery, which has appeared in an episode of BBC TV's The Hairy Bikers Go West, is also carrying on the town's tradition of reeling in royalty with its legendary gingerbread. Janet reveals how she and Lilli were given the honour, when Princess Anne visited Ormskirk in 2022 to open a new facility at Edge Hill University, of including some of their gingerbread in a welcome hamper.\n\"Has she come back since to stock up with supplies, like her great-grandfather Edward VII did?\" I ask.\n\"Not as far I know,\" she laughs, \"but I'd like to think there's a secret stash of Ormskirk gingerbread somewhere in one of the larders of Buckingham Palace!\"\u00a0\nEach year the town hosts Ormskirk Gingerbread Festival which, this year, is scheduled to take place on 13 July. The family-friendly event allows locals and visitors to learn more about the town's culinary heritage, and some women dress up in white shawls and aprons to honour Ormskirk's most famous gingerbread hawkers.\nIt's also an opportunity to celebrate this unassuming pocket of Lancashire that has quietly become a food lover's destination in its own right \u2013 no small achievement in a country where most culinary trends tend to point south. Whether you come for the royal gingerbread, the six Michelin stars or the rich farming roots that nourish it all, Ormskirk delivers the goods\u2026 and they\u2019re anything but half-baked.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The compound has been linked to improved cognitive performance and reduced anxiety \u2013 but are you getting enough of it?\nYou may not have heard of choline before, but studies show that it's crucial for our health, at various stages of life.\nCholine is neither a vitamin or a mineral \u2013 it's an organic compound that's vital to the healthy functioning of the human nervous system. Now there's emerging evidence that consuming more\u00a0choline\u00a0can have a wide range of powerful effects, from improving cognitive performance\u00a0to\u00a0protecting against neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia.\nThe nutrient also seems to play a significant role in human neurodevelopment. In one study, babies who whose mothers took choline supplements during pregnancy gave birth to infants with higher information processing speeds \u2013 a measure of healthy cognitive functioning.\nScientists say that choline is a wonder-nutrient, but that it has been hugely overlooked. So, where does choline come from \u2013 and are you getting enough of it?\nEvery cell in our body contains choline, says Xinyin Jiang, professor of health and nutrition sciences at Brooklyn College in New York, US.\nCholine is an \"essential\" nutrient, which means we need it for our health, but our bodies don't produce enough on their own. Instead, we need to get some of it from our diets. In this sense, it's similar to omega 3 fatty acids, although it's actually closely associated with B vitamins, says Emma Derbyshire, science writer and founder and CEO of the consultancy Nutritional Insight.\nMore like this:\nCholine can be found mostly in animal-based foods, including beef, eggs, fish, chicken and milk, but it's also in peanuts, kidney beans, mushrooms and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli\u00a0\u2013 although animal foods tend to contain more choline than plant-based sources.\nWe need choline for numerous functions in our bodies, including liver function. Not having enough can cause a number of problems.\n\"Choline helps fat transport out of the liver, and when a person is deficient, they can get a fatty liver,\" says Jiang.\nCholine also helps the body to synthesise phospholipids, which are the main component of the cell membranes in our bodies. Being deficient in the nutrient can affect the expression of genes involved in the process of our cells multiplying. During the development of a foetus, choline deficiency can be particularly harmful because it inhibits cell proliferation in the brain.\nCholine's role in the brain is crucial \u2013 in fact it's primarily a \"brain nutrient\", says Derbyshire. It's needed for our bodies to produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is a chemical that carries messages from your brain to your body through nerve cells. Acetylcholine plays a major role in brain nerve cells, which are needed for our memory, thinking and learning.\nIn one study involving almost 1,400 people aged 36 to 83, researchers found that people with a higher choline intake tended to have better memories, and that choline intake during midlife may help to protect our brains. Choline is commonly included as an ingredient in supplements taken as \"nootropics\" \u2013 a diverse group of substances which some people believe can enhance learning and memory.\nOn the other hand, choline deficiency has also been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\nAnother way choline may affect the brain is our mental health. One study found that higher intake of choline was associated with lower levels of anxiety. In another study, having a higher dietary intake of choline was linked to a lower risk of depression.\u00a0\nHaving an adequate choline intake can also come with a number of other benefits. A higher dietary intake of this nutrient .\nSeparately, research in mice has found that choline can help to lower the levels of homocysteine, an amino acid which can increase the risk of heart disease. High levels of homocysteine can also be linked to osteoporosis, and research has found that people with higher choline intakes from their diets tend to have a higher bone density \u2013 an indicator of strong, healthy bones with a lower risk of being fractured.\n\"Choline can potentially have an effect against bone loss,\" says \u00d8yen Jannike, a researcher at the Institute of Marine Research in Norway, who has studied the link between choline and bone health.\nThis may partly be because of homocysteine, she says, but also because choline is an essential structure in our cell membranes.\nIt's well established that a child's first two years are critical for their development, and that the mother's diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding has an integral influence on this.\nStudies show that choline is vitally important for a baby's development in the womb. In fact, babies are born with three times as much choline as their mothers, which Derbyshire says shows how important it is at this stage of life.\nSeveral studies have found that the supply of choline in the womb correlates to the cognitive outcome of the baby, and its benefits may continue for years as the child develops. In one study, pregnant women who had the highest dietary choline intake during the second trimester of pregnancy (from week 13 to week 28) went on to have children who scored higher on a test of short- and long-term memory at the age of seven.\nSome research even suggests insufficient choline intake when a woman is pregnant could be linked ADHD behaviours in their offspring.\nAre we getting enough choline?\nIn Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has set recommendations for choline intake: 400mg for adults, and 480mg and 520mg for pregnant and breastfeeding individuals, respectively.\nIn the US, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) first established adequate choline intake recommendations in 1998: 550mg per day for men and 425mg per day for women, or 450mg during pregnancy and 550mg while breastfeeding.\nAn egg has around 150mg of choline, while a chicken breast has around 72mg, and a handful of peanuts has around 24mg.\nIn 2017, the American Media Association (AMA) also advised that prenatal vitamin supplements should contain \"evidence-based\" amounts of choline.\n\"We're seeing a lot more ADHD and dyslexia in schools, and some is genetic, but it's also possible that, in utero, they're not getting key nutrients,\" Derbyshire says. \"These very subtle neurodevelopment changes are occurring and impacting them later on. We're treating the aftermath now.\"\nJiang has studied the relationship between the supply of choline during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and brain development. \"In animal findings, when the mum has\u00a0more choline, the cognitive development\u00a0of their offspring is better,\" she says. \"We're starting to find similar results in human studies, although, not exactly the same.\"\nA 2020 review of 38 animal and 16 human studies concluded that\u00a0choline supplementation helps brain development. However, only animal studies currently show a strong link between choline and improved cognitive function. The paper doesn't define the ideal amount of supplementation, but says most human studies use supplements providing up to 930mg choline daily \u2013 an amount equivalent to the choline in roughly\u00a0six chicken's eggs\u00a0\u2013 with no adverse effects reported.\nThere may also be some people that require more choline than the recommended daily amounts, says \u00d8yen \u2013 including post-menopausal women, for example, who have lower levels of oestrogen, and people with fatty liver disease.\nWe also know, Derbyshire says, that, due to the genetic differences from one person to another, some people may have higher requirements for choline. (Derbyshire has previously consulted for and advised The Meat Advisory Panel, Marlow Foods (Quorn), the Health Supplement Information Service and the British Egg Information Service, among other organisations).\nWhen we eat foods containing choline, it's very easily absorbed into our blood, says Jiang, which should go some way to ensuring we're consuming enough choline.\nHowever, several studies show that many of us aren't getting enough. One study found that only 11% of American adults consume the recommended daily amount.\nEggs are one of the most potent dietary sources of choline, and there is some concern that those who choose to follow a vegan diet may not be getting enough of this nutrient \u2013 though there are many plant-based sources and choline supplements are widely available in developed countries.\nOne study found that people who eat eggs have almost twice the usual choline intake compared with those who don't, leading the researchers to conclude that consuming the daily adequate amount of choline was \"extremely difficult\" without eating eggs or taking a supplement.\nBut the EFSA's recommendation of 400mg of choline per day is achievable for most people if you plan your diet carefully, says Jiang. Some vegan sources of choline include tofu (28mg of choline per 100g), peanut butter (61-66mg per 100g) and soy beans (120mg per 100g).\nAnyone concerned they're not getting enough choline can take a daily supplement, \u00d8yen says. In the meantime, she adds, there needs to be more animal and human research to better understand the mechanisms behind some of choline's health benefits.\nHowever \"clinicians are becoming more aware of [choline]\", says Derbyshire. While it often seems to be slightly overlooked, she is hopeful that\u00a0choline will soon start to enjoy the limelight.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He claims they will address unfairness in global trade.Canada was not directly hit by the new swathe of American tariffs - which also came into force at midnight - but Ottawa was already in a row with Washington over  Trump's pre-existing policies, which tax a range of items brought across the border.\"We'll protect our workers, our businesses, and our economy,\" Champagne wrote on X, as he confirmed the start of the retaliatory Canadian measures.A factsheet from the government clarified that Canadian importers would be forced to pay a tax of 25% on certain automobiles or their parts:Any fully-assembled vehicles arriving from the US that were not compliant with the CUSMA North American free-trade agreementAny \"non-Canadian and non-Mexican content\" that formed part of a fully-assembled vehicle arriving from the US, even if it complied with CUSMAThe confirmation comes after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney - who is in an election fight - vowed a forceful response to Trump's tariffs.

It later closed the day's trading up 9.5%, while the Dow Jones surged by 7.8%.\nAnnouncing the latest iteration of his plan on Truth Social, Trump said he was authorising a 90-day pause on tariffs for the countries that had not retaliated against his levies.\nThe additional tariff on Beijing, he said, would be effective immediately. \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realise that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,\" he wrote.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted the change of policy had not been influenced by the global falls, but senior Democrat Chuck Schumer said the decision showed Trump was \"reeling and retreating\".\nSpeaking outside the White House, Trump later said the amendments to his tariffs policy had \"had to be done\" because people were \"getting yippy\".\n\"I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate because I told them 'if you retaliate, we're going to double it' - and that's what I did with China,\" he said, adding that he thought, \"It's all going to work out amazing.\"\nHe also said he thought Chinese President Xi Jinping was \"going to want to get to a deal\".\nIn the UK, which was not affected by the changes as it was already on the list of countries receiving the baseline 10% tariff, a No 10 spokeswoman said a \"trade war is in nobody's interests\".\nA source also said the developments in Washington showed \"cool and calm can pay off\".\nThe ongoing stand-off between China and the US - the world's two biggest economies - began when Trump announced new tariffs last week.\nChina was hit with an additional 34% tariff, on top of a 20% levy the president had put in place earlier this year. However, Beijing was quick to retaliate with a 34% tariff on US imports to China.\nIn response, Trump threatened an additional 50%, bringing the total to 104% on Tuesday, if Beijing did not back down. China did not change course and said it would \"fight to the end\" if the US \"insists on provoking a tariff war or trade war\".\nJust hours after the 104% tariffs from the US kicked in earlier, Beijing announced it would raise its own tariffs on American goods from 34% to 84% from Thursday.\nChina's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said on Wednesday the US \"continues to impose tariffs on China in an abusive manner\".\nHe said China opposes such \"bullying practices\" and the US must show \"an attitude of equality, mutual respect, and reciprocity\" if it hopes to resolve issues through negotiation.\nThe deteriorating relationship between the two nations could see their goods trade fall as much as 80% - a $466bn (\u00a3363bn) drop, according to World Trade Organization forecasts. \n\"Our assessments, informed by the latest developments, highlight the substantial risks associated with further escalation,\" Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, head of the WTO, said. \nAway from China, Trump's latest plans have not affected other recently-announced tariffs already in play.\nThese include the 25% import taxes on cars and car parts coming into the US, which came into effect on 2 April, and a further 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the European Union approved a first set of retaliatory tariffs against the US, due to take effect on 15 April. The bloc, on Trump's \"worst offender\" trading partner list, had been due to receive customised tariffs of 20%. \nBut because the EU's retaliatory tariffs had not yet gone into effect, the White House included it on the list of countries to be capped at 10%. \nMeanwhile, the so-called baseline rate never applied to Canada and Mexico - key trading partners of the US - and a White House official has said neither is in line to receive the 10% baseline tariff now.

        "article_text": "Chef Ruben Bond\u00ec knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church, in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving \u2013 and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bond\u00ec, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, the tradizione giudaico-romanesca (Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset of Roman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bond\u00ec, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Maurizio Fiorino)\nRuben Bond\u00ec is a Roman chef and food influencer whose cooking videos have earned him more than four million followers on social media. In 2023, he published a cookbook on Jewish Roman cuisine, Cucina con Ruben.\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes \u2013 expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy \u2013 from carciofi alla giudia (fried artichokes) to stracotto (braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing \u2013 typical [Jewish] dishes like concia di zucchine [marinated fried courgettes] and abbacchio [roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history \u2013 from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 \u2013 Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so] the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto \u2013 sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace \u2013 is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bond\u00ec's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae \u2013 the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol \u2013 Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\nDon't get your artichokes off-season\nWhile artichokes may be the undeniable star of the Roman Jewish kitchen, Bond\u00ec recommends visitors only consume the vegetable when it's in harvest. \"Avoid getting artichokes when they're off-season,\" he advises. \"You won't be served Italian artichokes, and they won't be as fresh. You should only get them when it's artichoke season, so from November-December to May.\"\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples is carciofi alla giudia \u2013 a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes like spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches in Venice, Florence and Milan. Its main restaurant \u2013 a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures \u2013 does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearby Ba'Ghetto Milky.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram: @baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institution Renato al Ghetto \u2013 where Bond\u00ec worked as a waiter in his younger days \u2013 realised it could replicate its success with street food, its\u00a0hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosette are a type of Roman bap,\" Bond\u00ec says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beef stracotto or Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chicken alla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under \u20ac12 (\u00a310).\n\"It's very good,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S. Maria del Pianto, 63, 00186\nPhone: +39 338 859 3395\nInstagram: @rosetteria_renato_al_ghetto\n\"Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,\" Ruben says. \"And for meat lovers, I recommend BellaCarne.\"\nLocated a mere block from the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, the restaurant's name itself is particularly promising \u2013 translating literally to \"Beautiful Meat\" \u2013 and its dishes definitely live up to expectations.\n\"I can especially vouch for their grilled meats,\" Bond\u00ec says, which include scottadito lamb and veal chops.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut while meat in all its forms \u2013 roast, fried, stewed and braised \u2013 is the undeniable star, it isn't the only thing worth ordering.\n\"They have an excellent vegan crostata [tart] for dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says, made with almond paste and sour cherries.\nRoman Jewish food may be humble by nature, but BellaCarne offers a decidedly refined dining experience, set in a chic, wood-panelled interior. As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.bellacarne.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 51, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 683 3104\nInstagram: \n@bellacarne/\nThe dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expressly casereccio \u2013 homestyle, homemade.\nCasalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.\n\"It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nThe restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successful Dolce Kosher bakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.\nAmong its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia. Bond\u00ec emphatically recommends Casalino's roasts, but notes that the Zarfati family tightly guards the recipe.\n\"It's a secret,\" he says.\nWebsite: https://casalinoosteriakosher.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 1e, 00186\nPhone number: +39 06 7978 1514\nInstagram: @casalino.osteriakosher/\nWhile most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together), Il Giardino Romano has adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate.\n\"It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nAs its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (\"The Roman Garden\") has a green thumb \u2013 its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which Bond\u00ec calls the restaurant's speciality.\nThe mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use \u2013 from fettuccine alle vongole (pasta with clams) to cacio e pepe to even more idiosyncratic pairings.\n\"[Il Giardino Romano] has a particularly unique dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"A ricotta crostata with artichoke.\"\nAnd if the menu does not succeed in evoking the bucolic delights of the Roman orchard, its setting certainly will \u2013 the restaurant has a small brick courtyard covered in trees and hanging ivy.\nWebsite:https://www.ilgiardinoromano.com\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia 18, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 6880 9661\nInstagram: @ristorante_il_giardino_romano/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

At club we are silly and funny. That is where we are at Bristol after Ilona brought a real nice light to social media and filled us with confidence to show your personality and enjoy it.\n\"I want women \u2013 for me anyway as it is not something I had \u2013 to be really strong female role models.\n\"Let's roll with the punches. That is what I would love to be and something I am navigating in myself. It is something I would love people to look up to and say 'she gave it her best shot, had fun, what a way of living life'.\"\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast\nMatthews returns as England make three changes\nIlona Maher was praised for her engagement with fans during her time at Bristol Bears\nBern confirmed 28-year-old American star Maher had been in touch after the divisive dance to say \"haters are gonna hate\" and was full of support for the pair.\nBristol prop Bern had done something similar with England fans after the win against Italy in York which also went viral., external\nShe has no regrets over her recent TikTok efforts, remaining professional in her preparation for games and eager to grow the women's game before a home Rugby World Cup in August.\n\"It is a new landscape and we are moulding it for ourselves,\" Bern said.\n\"We can decide as female rugby players what this space looks like. It doesn't have to look a certain way, and if you don't like what I do then you don't have to watch it or comment. You can scroll past.\n\"There are a lot of people out there who do enjoy it and there were a lot of positive comments. For every negative one there are three or four nice comments.\"\nMaher can play at centre or on the wing and won a bronze medal in sevens for the United States at the Paris Olympics last summer.\nShe scored four tries in seven games during a three-month spell at the Bears and has recently been included in USA's XVs player pool for this year, while continuing her successful social media career.\nThe World Cup marks the first time Maher could feature in competition for the United States in XVs since 2021, as she aims to be involved in the opening game against England at  Sunderland's Stadium of Light in August.\n\"Ilona is so humble and works incredibly hard. Everything you see on social media is her and she is a brilliant icon for not only our sport but women in general,\" Bern added.\n\"If I can be a tiny bit like her then that would be amazing.\n\"She is doing so much for our sport.

        "article_text": "On 12 March, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was driving home with his young son in Maryland when he was stopped by agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nAgents took Mr Garcia into custody, then shuttled him to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas. \nAccording to a federal judge, after three days, \"without any notice, legal process, or hearing\", Mr Garcia found himself back in his native El Salvador at an infamous prison known for housing gang members. \nThe government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\".\nBut despite that, Mr Garcia remains incarcerated in El Salvador as lawyers debate the unusual intricacies of the case. \nA Maryland court ordered Mr Garcia be returned to the US,  but Trump officials argued that they cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr Garcia. The administration also argued that the judge ordering his return lacked the authority to do so.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on lower court orders while they consider the matter.\nImmigration experts say that as US President Donald Trump takes a hardline approach on illegal immigration, this case has the potential to upend due process  for immigrants.\n\"If the US Supreme Court were to accept [the Trump administration's] position, it would completely eviscerate any rule of law in the immigration process,\" Maureen Sweeney, director of the University of Maryland's Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, told the BBC.  \n\"Because they could pick up anybody, at any time, and send them anywhere with no repercussions whatsoever.\"\nUS District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in a filing Sunday that ICE officials did not follow procedures in the Immigration and Nationality Act when they deported Mr Garcia to El Salvador.\nShe ruled the US must bring him back before midnight on Monday. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, writing that the US \"has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street\".\nYet the Trump administration has argued that it cannot comply, saying Judge Xinis' filing is outside her jurisdiction.\n\"Neither a federal district court nor the United States has authority to tell the Government of El Salvador what to do,\" US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nNicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School said that while it is true - US district judges cannot order El Salvador to take action -  they can order the US government to have Mr Garcia returned.\nShe also said the US has previously facilitated the return of mistakenly deported individuals.\nProf Hallett also questioned the government's claim that the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr Garcia, citing an agreement between the two countries.\nThe US, under the Trump administration, paid El Salvador's government $6m to house prisoners it sends, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Top officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump himself have publicly touted the arrangement.\n\"It's almost as if the Salvadoran government is acting as an agent of the US government,\" Ms Hallett said, arguing that this makes the release more plausible.\nMr Garcia's lawyers argued that because El Salvador was detaining Mr Garcia \"at the direct request and pursuant to financial compensation\" from the US, the court could order the US government to request his return.\nThe Department of Justice, however, has resisted calls to take such action.\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that \"it was an administrative error as to why he was deported,\" but maintained the allegation that Mr Garcia belonged to a gang.\n\"We believe he should stay where he is,\" she said.\nMr Garcia is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison. Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation.\nMr Garcia, who is married to a US citizen, does not have any gang ties and has never been charged with a crime, his lawyer says.\nHe was also protected by a \"withholding of removal\" order, which means the US government cannot send him back to El Salvador because he could face harm. The order dates back to 2019, when ICE first took Mr Garcia into custody and alleged he belonged to the MS-13 criminal organisation, an allegation he denied at the time.\nSuch orders are common, immigration lawyers told the BBC, and are an alternative to asylum protections.\n\"It was an unlawful act, for the US to return him to the country where he could not be returned,\" said Amelia Wilson, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at Pace University.\nA judge ultimately granted Mr Garcia the 2019 order after he \"testified about how he was a victim of gang violence in El Salvador when he was a teenager and he came to the US to escape all of that,\" his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, wrote in a March 2025 affidavit.\nDepartment of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni acknowledged that at the time the \"government did not appeal that decision, so it is final\".\nThe Trump administration now reiterates allegations that Mr Garcia belonged to MS-13, but Judge Xinis said the government made this claim \"without any evidence\" and had not produced a removal order or warrant.\nThe Trump administration continues to press its case to the nation's highest court, setting up a potential showdown over the White House's deportation strategy.\nChief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay on Monday night, pausing lower court rulings while the US Supreme Court considers the government's appeal.\nPresident Trump touted the stay as a victory, writing on Truth Social that the ruling allowed the president \"to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself.\"\nImmigration lawyers, meanwhile, are watching Mr Garcia's case closely, considering it a test for how much power the administration can exert over US immigration.\n\"If the Trump administration is trying to remove these individuals by bypassing the immigration courts,\" said Ms Wilson, \"there's a direct and obvious line between what they're doing, and an effort by the administration to completely usurp judicial and due process.\"",

        "article_text": "The young cast of Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza\u2019s film Warfare had to bond pretty quickly, to play a US military unit whose lives depended on each other, during the Iraq war in 2006.\nFamiliarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp. \nThey lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.  \nFirst off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.\n\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC. \nThe actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.\nWe see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.\nHeartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.\nThe actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.\nWarfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off. \nThe cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.\n\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.\n\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"\nThe movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.\nThe group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces. \nThe military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day. \nWhat they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.\nShot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.\nThe soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.\nOscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.\nHe was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.\n\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.\nThey got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer. \nMendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.\nThe veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller. \nMiller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated. \nDuring the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.\n\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.\n\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.\n\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"\nSo Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.\nThe crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together. \n\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says. \n\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions. \n\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"\nMiller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\". \nIt was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set. \n\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"\nThe soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".\nGarland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.\n\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.\n\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.\n\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"\nCollating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.\n\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.\nHe shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".\nNot surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp. \nHe was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority. \nThe actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".\n\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process. \nMendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.\n\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"\nConnor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it. \n\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"\nThe film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, while the New Yorker said it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\". \nThe Guardian said the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"\nPoulter says he admires the film-makers' determination to make Warfare purely factual. \n\"Hopefully this film contributes to a better understanding of just how negative, and how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss...\n\"I think this is as much an anti-war film as you can possibly hope to see.\"\nWarfare is out in cinemas on Friday, 18 April.",

People have seen their life savings gone and that money is going to finance criminals.\"\nShe said quishing was significantly under-reported and presented a \"huge challenge\" to authorities globally.\n\nFraudulent and misleading codes have also been spotted on parcels, in emails and on television.\nPeople who scan them using mobile phones and other electronic devices are directed to websites controlled by the scammers and tricked into handing over data such as bank details.\nMs Hart said some of those placing the codes were likely to be at the bottom of a hierarchy of organised criminals and may not be aware of the implications of their actions.\nAction Fraud statistics obtained by the BBC's Shared Data Unit suggest a rapid growth in this kind of scam, with recorded incidents more than doubling in the UK between 2023 and 2024.\nOver the past five years, Action Fraud received almost 3,000 reports in total, with a fifth of those linked to the Metropolitan Police force area.\nMilton Haworth used his mobile phone to scan a QR code at a council-run car park in Castleford, West Yorkshire.\nIt directed him to download an unauthorised app, from which he agreed a 90p fee to verify bank details.\nBut instead of paying to park, he found himself signed up to a subscription service with a \u00a339 yearly fee and no refunds offered.\n\"I'd assumed I'd paid for my parking but realised it was a scam when I noticed the next day that \u00a339 had gone out of my account,\" he said.\n\"The sign said to use the code to park and I hadn't ever heard of QR codes being used as a scam.\"\nMr Haworth blames the spike in cases on authorities \"not taking this seriously enough\".\nHe said: \"Nobody seems to care, there doesn't seem to be anyone trying to find these people.\n\"It's incumbent on the authorities to go after them but I don't think they do because it's small amounts taken, not multimillions.\n\"But if it's \u00a339 a month, what if there's a million people being duped?\"\nMs Hart said victims often lost small amounts initially as those responsible gathered the data they needed to launch a \"secondary scam\".\n\"You might lose \u00a32.99 and a lot of people won't report that and don't realise they've passed on their information to a criminal organisation,\" Ms Hart said.\n\"Days or weeks later, they get a call telling them they've been the victim of a fraud and they can pinpoint a day, because they already have all of the information you shared with them earlier.\n\"They convince you using very coercive tactics that they're from your bank, police or Trading Standards and they want to take everything you've got.\"\nExperts including the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre say it is vital that people \"stay vigilant to cyber criminals\".\nKirsty Blackman, Scottish National Party MP for Aberdeen North, spoke to the BBC after removing fake QR codes from parking machines in the city.\nShe said tackling the problem was \"genuinely difficult\", adding: \"Organised criminals are there to make money in whatever way they can and I think they'll scam people whatever we do. It's about trying to whack the moles as they pop up.\"\nShe said the more victims filed reports with Action Fraud, the better police could take action.\n\"QR codes can be really useful,\" she said. \"My kids' school sends them out regularly to share information, for example. That's why it's difficult for people to tell the difference between a legitimate code and a fake one.\n\"When you're scanning a code to pay for something, that's when you really need to stop and think.\"\nJoe Hall's girlfriend inadvertently scanned a fraudulent QR code when trying to pay for parking in Luton before Christmas.\nThe couple now refuse to use QR codes after \u00a3400 was taken from her bank account the next day.\nMr Hall said: \"I drove back to the car park and found the code she scanned was a sticker. They print them so everything's the same font and colours as the signage and it blends in.\n\"If you know what you're looking for, you might spot it but a lot of the time, you might not even think about it.\n\"It's so easy for them to make money out of it - there were four others behind my girlfriend doing the same thing as she did.\n\"She got her money back but that's not always the case. They could easily just empty your bank account.\"\nNational Car Parks, which runs 800 car parking sites across the UK, is considering removing QR codes from its signage.\nIt said a \"rigorous process\" had already been introduced to prevent its QR codes being compromised, with signs inspected and codes checked every day.\nA spokesman said two of its car parks had been targeted by scammers and the business was \"reviewing options\" to reduce the impact of fraudulent QR codes.\nHe said: \"This could include removing a QR code from our signage that directs customers to a payment page, and instead emphasising the use of our website.\n\"We understand the value of QR codes and will still look to use them where we can safely.\"\nDet Supt Gary Miles, head of the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, encouraged users to \"stay alert\" to signs of fraudulent codes.\n\"You should stop and check before scanning one,\" he said. \"If you're in person, check for signs it has been tampered with, or online, look out for phishing emails or rogue social media posts with QR codes.\n\"We know that QR codes can be used in all aspects of life, online and in-person, however this doesn't stop fraudsters finding new ways to target members of the public.\"\nMore about this story\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nRead more about the Local News Partnerships here.",

        "article_text": "US envoy Steve Witkoff met Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday, as Donald Trump urged the Russian president to \"get moving\" on a ceasefire in Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin said the meeting lasted for more than four hours and focused on \"aspects of a Ukrainian settlement\". The talks, Witkoff's third with Putin this year, were described by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev as \"productive\".  \nTrump has expressed frustration with Putin over the state of talks. On Friday, he wrote on social media: \"Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war.\" \nIt comes as Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg denied suggesting the country could be partitioned.\nThe Times said that, during an interview with the paper, Kellogg had proposed British and French troops could adopt zones of control in the west of Ukraine as part of a \"reassurance force\".\nRussia's army, he reportedly suggested, could then remain in the occupied east. \"You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two\", the paper quoted him as saying.\nKellogg later took to social media to say the article had \"misrepresented\" what he said. \"I was speaking of a post-ceasefire resiliency force in support of Ukraine's sovereignty,\" he wrote on X, adding: \"I was NOT referring to a partitioning of Ukraine.\"\nNeither the White House nor Kyiv reacted to the comments immediately. The BBC has asked the Times for its response.\nEarlier on Friday, European nations agreed \u20ac21bn ($24bn; \u00a318bn) in military aid for Kyiv.\nAt the event, Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war.\nAhead of the Putin-Witkoff talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was \"no need to expect breakthroughs\" as the \"process of normalising relations is ongoing\".\nAsked whether discussions could include setting up a date for Putin and Trump to meet, Peskov said: \"Let's see. It depends on what Witkoff has come with.\"\nBeforehand, Witkoff had a meeting with Dmitriev at the Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg, where a conference was held on stainless steel and the Russian market. \nDmitriev, the 49-year-old head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, visited Washington last week and was the most senior Russian official to go to the US since the country's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nMeanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war during a visit on Friday to the site of a 4 April Russian missile attack on his home town of Kryvyi Rih. The attack killed 19 people, including nine children.\nHe also alleged that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting with the Russian army. It comes after Ukraine said it had captured two Chinese nationals.\n\"We have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia's occupation forces,\" Zelensky said.\n\"This means Russia is clearly trying to prolong the war even by using Chinese lives.\"\nZelensky laid flowers in front of photos of Herman Tripolets, nine, and seven-year-olds Arina Samodina and Radyslav Yatsko.\nHe later reiterated a call for air defence systems \"to protect lives and our cities\".\n\"We discussed this with President Trump - Ukraine is not just asking, we're ready to purchase these additional systems,\" he wrote on social media.\n\"Only powerful weapons can truly be relied upon to protect life when you have a neighbour like Russia.\"\nTrump has previously claimed he could end the Ukraine-Russia conflict \"in 24 hours\". On Friday, he declared that it would not have happened at all if he'd been in the White House in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\"A war that should ld [sic] have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!,\" he wrote.\nIn February US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first face-to-face talks since the invasion. Officials have also been meeting to discuss restoring full diplomatic relations.\nTrump has also had a fractious relationship with Zelensky since his second term as US president began, culminating in an angry confrontation in the Oval Office in February.\nThe US attempted to broker a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, only for it to stall when the Kremlin asked for sanctions imposed after it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour to be lifted.\nTrump has since said he is \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" with Putin over the lack of progress in agreeing a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.\nEarlier this week, Washington and Moscow went ahead with a prisoner swap. \nKsenia Karelina, a Russian-American, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in Russia for donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity when the war began in February 2022.     \nThe Los Angeles resident was freed on Thursday morning and exchanged for Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in Cyprus in 2023. \nHe was accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Russia for manufacturers working with the military.",

        "article_text": "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.\nMany of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.\nThe effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.\nAnd if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.\nBen Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.\n\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.\nThough others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.\nAnd there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.\nWhile a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.\n\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.\nThe US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.\nIt says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.\nAlong with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.\nIndia and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.\nAs tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.\nReuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.\nAmid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.\nThe BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet. \nTrump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.\nHowever, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly. \nThis, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.\nApple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.\nBut Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.\n\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.\nApple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.  \nSome analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them. \n\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.\nBut he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.\n\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"\nSome estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers. \nFollowing Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.  \nThey estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.\nWhile some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.\nThere's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen. \nThis hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.\nThe BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.\nAnthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.\n\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.\nBruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.\n\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.\nWe will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.\nBut if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.\nCCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.\nThe iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market -

        "summary": "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?1 day agoShareSaveLiv McMahonTechnology reporterZoe KleinmanTechnology editor\u2022@zskShareSaveReutersThe world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched. \"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.Where are iPhones made?The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet. \"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?Will iPhone prices go up?Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices. \"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025. \"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.Julia told the BBC she was expecting costs to rise across a wealth of areas, from groceries to gadgetsWe will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",

The talks, Witkoff's third with Putin this year, were described by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev as \"productive\".  \nTrump has expressed frustration with Putin over the state of talks. On Friday, he wrote on social media: \"Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war.\"   \nEarlier in the day, European nations agreed \u20ac21bn ($24bn; \u00a318bn) in military aid for Kyiv.\nAt the event, Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war.\nAhead of the Putin-Witkoff talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was \"no need to expect breakthroughs\" as the \"process of normalising relations is ongoing\".\nAsked whether discussions could include setting up a date for Putin and Trump to meet, Peskov said: \"Let's see. It depends on what Witkoff has come with.\"\nBeforehand, Witkoff had a meeting with Dmitriev at the Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg, where a conference was held on stainless steel and the Russian market. \nDmitriev, the 49-year-old head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, visited Washington last week and was the most senior Russian official to go to the US since the country's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nMeanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war during a visit on Friday to the site of a 4 April Russian missile attack on his home town of Kryvyi Rih. The attack killed 19 people, including nine children.\nHe also alleged that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting with the Russian army. It comes after Ukraine said it had captured two Chinese nationals.\n\"We have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia's occupation forces,\" Zelensky said.\n\"This means Russia is clearly trying to prolong the war even by using Chinese lives.\"\nZelensky laid flowers in front of photos of Herman Tripolets, nine, and seven-year-olds Arina Samodina and Radyslav Yatsko.\nHe later reiterated a call for air defence systems \"to protect lives and our cities\".\n\"We discussed this with President Trump - Ukraine is not just asking, we're ready to purchase these additional systems,\" he wrote on social media.\n\"Only powerful weapons can truly be relied upon to protect life when you have a neighbour like Russia.\"\nTrump has previously claimed he could end the Ukraine-Russia conflict \"in 24 hours\". On Friday, he declared that it would not have happened at all if he'd been in the White House in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\"A war that should ld [sic] have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!,\" he wrote.\nIn February US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first face-to-face talks since the invasion. Officials have also been meeting to discuss restoring full diplomatic relations.\nTrump has also had a fractious relationship with Zelensky since his second term as US president began, culminating in an angry confrontation in the Oval Office in February.\nThe US attempted to broker a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, only for it to stall when the Kremlin asked for sanctions imposed after it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour to be lifted.\nTrump has since said he is \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" with Putin over the lack of progress in agreeing a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.\nEarlier this week, Washington and Moscow went ahead with a prisoner swap. \nKsenia Karelina, a Russian-American, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in Russia for donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity when the war began in February 2022.     \nThe Los Angeles resident was freed on Thursday morning and exchanged for Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in Cyprus in 2023. \nHe was accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Russia for manufacturers working with the military.",

We must proceed making sure that for the better of all we're not trampling over a good many to get there.\"\nLondonderry author Claire Allan has published 21 psychological thrillers and romantic comedies. She has also worked as a series consultant on the BBC Northern Ireland series Blue Lights.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme on Wednesday, Ms Allan said she was shocked after reading about the investigation to find her entire body of written work when she searched Library Genesis.\n\"The sum of 20 years work being used to train AI. It's just really disheartening to see,\" Ms Allan said.\n\"It takes so much to create a book, and you put your heart and soul into it.\n\"For somebody to come along and just scrape what they want from it is frustrating and demoralising.\"\nLast week, authors gathered in London to protest against Meta's actions and high profile authors including Kate Mosse, Richard Osman, and Val McDermid signed an open letter calling on the Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy to bring Meta management to parliament.\nPosting on X, Richard Osman, who wrote the popular Thursday Murder Club series, said: \"Copyright law is not complicated at all.

Then he sold. \n\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first',\" he said. \"My mind was sprinting.\"\nIn 25 years of trading, he said he had rarely experienced anything like it.\nTrillions were wiped off the value of financial markets around the world in the aftermath of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement. \nLeading share indexes in the US and UK saw some of the steepest declines since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, dropping more than 10% over three days. \nOil prices sank and so did the dollar. \nBy Wednesday, the worries had spread to the bond market, as investors started dumping US government debt, usually a safe haven for investors in times of uncertainty.\nWhen Trump announced he was putting some of the most eye-watering tariffs on pause, shares stopped sliding and rallied. \nBut the market turmoil was far from over. \nTrump left in place a tariff of 10% on imports from most countries and a tariff of 145% on goods from China, America's third largest source of imports after the European Union and Mexico.\nA day after the announcement, the S&P 500 dropped another 3.5%, the Dow slid 2.5% and the Nasdaq fell 4.3%.\nAt St Louis-based Argent Capital Management, the mood, said portfolio manager Jed Ellerbroek, was \"still miserable\".\nSome of his firm's holdings, like health insurance giant United Healthcare, have done well over the last week, as investors look for companies likely to be able to weather the tariff storm.\nBut his third largest investment is Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones and other products in China.\n\"Trump has induced a gigantic amount of uncertainty into the global economy and consumers and investors and business managers are reeling and unable to make long-term decisions,\" Mr Ellerboek said. \n\"We are really on hold, because we only trade when we have high conviction levels,\" he said.\n\"What do we do with Apple? I don't know. I'm not going to change when I have no clue what the tariff rate is going to be next week,\" he said. \nFaced with so many uncertainties, some investors are simply quitting the market, said John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics.\n\"What you're looking at, broadly speaking, is a market that is frustrated, uncertain and confused about where we're going to be one day to the next,\" he said.  \"In that environment you have a tendency to see some investors choosing the safety of cash.\"\nWhile Trump's tariff rollback was a \"relief\", he said it did not change the bigger picture: firms in the US that are bringing in parts or products are facing significantly higher import taxes than they were at the start of the year. \n\"The tariffs that remain are still high enough that they are likely to push up inflation and weigh significantly on the economy as we go forward,\" he said.\n\"We're just back trading again on the broader long-term outlook of the tariff implications, which is still negative.\"",

        "article_text": "Recent changes by the Trump administration are affecting how US museums and institutions tell the nation's multicultural history to travellers.\nIn the last few months, US President Donald Trump has threatened to annex Canada; warned that the US will \"go as far as we have to go\" to seize Greenland; and imposed tariffs on all nations, effectively initiating a global trade war. But while many of Trump's most dramatic \"America first\" actions are aimed at other countries, his sweeping new policy changes are also affecting how the US tells its own multicultural story.\nSeveral highly touristed landmarks in the US are already facing significant changes.\nOn 27 March, Trump signed an executive order titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, arguing that there has been \"a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation's history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth\". The order took specific aim at the Smithsonian Institution, whose 21 museums, 21 libraries and many other research and cultural centres comprise the world's largest museum complex and were visited by nearly 17 million people in 2024.\n\"Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement,\" the order states, \"the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of divisive, race-centred ideology.\"\nThe order threatens to bar congressional funds from institutions that espouse \"improper, divisive or anti-American\" beliefs. As an example of this, Trump cited programming from the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History & Culture, the only national museum devoted exclusively to documenting African American life, history and culture from slavery to the modern era.\nHeadquartered on the National Mall in Washington DC, some of the Smithsonian's many museums focus on marginalised communities in the US \u2013 including the National Museum of the American Indian,the National Museum of African Art, the National Museum of the American Latino and the embattled National Museum of African American History and Culture.\u00a0\nMany activists and historians have expressed outrage over the order's broader meaning and argued that it is actually a brazen attempt to do what Trump is denouncing: rewrite US history. This begs the question, which version of the US will visitors find?\n\"It seems like we're headed in the direction where there's even an attempt to deny that the institution of slavery even existed, or that Jim Crow laws and segregation and racial violence against Black communities, Black families, Black individuals even occurred,\" said Dr Clarissa Myrick-Harris White, a historian and Africana studies professor at the historically Black Morehouse College in a statement to the Associated Press.\nThis concern was echoed by the American Historical Association, whose 10,000 members represent the world's largest organisation of professional historians. In a statement co-signed by 31 organisations, the association says the executive order \"egregiously misrepresents the work of the Smithsonian Institution\", which was established by Congress more than 175 years ago for the \"increase and diffusion of knowledge\".\n\"The stories that have shaped our past include not only elements that make us proud but also aspects that make us acutely aware of tragedies in our nation's history,\" the statement notes. \"No person, no nation, is perfect, and we should all \u2013 as individuals and as nations \u2013 learn from our imperfections.\"\u00a0\nSome feel Trump's targeting of the Smithsonian is part of a broader culture war he has been waging against \"woke ideology\" across many of the nation's federally run institutions. Since returning to office, Trump has worked to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, which oversaw grant funding for numerous Native American, Native Hawaiian, Latinx and African American museums across the country; and Trump's agencies have reportedly issued a list of words to limit or disappear from government websites, like \"women\", \"Black\" and \"cultural heritage\".\nSome of these references have already been removed from websites or displays of traveller-friendly landmarks. In February, Stonewall National Monument in New York City, which is run by the US National Park Service, erased references to transgender people. In March, Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia \u2013 which is managed by the US Department of the Army \u2013 scrubbed its website of any information highlighting the contributions of African American, Hispanic or female servicemembers, including removing stories about veteran and civil rights leader Medgar Evers and the Tuskegee Airmen, the US's first Black Airforce pilots. In nearby Washington DC, a two-block section of 16th Street leading to the White House with the words \"Black Lives Matter\" was recently repaved in response to threats to cut transportation funding if the plaza was not renamed.\n\"If you take a broad brush and say we've spent too much time talking about folks other than old white [men], then you have wiped out a lot of what actually makes America great,\" said Greg Werkheiser, founding partner of Cultural Heritage Partners, a law firm that specialises in protecting cultural heritage sites. \"A lot of places around the world have had similar challenges and have not overcome them. We have. And those lessons are not lessons of self-loathing and tragedy, they're lessons about how we keep pushing towards a more perfect union.\"\nSince the Black Lives Matter protests five years ago, many museums and other cultural institutions have sought to include more diverse perspectives in their exhibitions, a move that often boosted their visitor numbers. But as Werkheiser explained, the Trump administration's unprecedented exertion of influence on cultural institutions is especially problematic for those that specialise in telling stories from Black, Asian, Latinx and LGBTQ+ perspectives, since many of these places rely on federal funding to keep them afloat.\n\"That baseline of commitment [from the government] is essential to ensure that the ebbs and flows of private donors don't take out institutions. When we take that away, we make these institutions very unstable.\"\nVisitors to the US may now find that even larger museums and organisations have been forced to make sweeping changes to their programming in light of the new policies. The DC-based Art Museum of the Americas cancelled two planned exhibitions highlighting the work of Black and LGBTQ+ artists in March, reportedly in response to the administration's new diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. Meanwhile, the United States Marine Band, the country's oldest continually active musical association, recently cancelled a concert that was supposed to feature young musicians of colour. Perhaps most famously, in February Trump seized control of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, one of the US's premier arts institutions. Since Trump's takeover, a host of acts have cancelled their planned appearances in protest.\n\"If it didn't matter, they wouldn't try to stop us,\" said Ashley Rogers, executive director of the Whitney Plantation, the only plantation museum in Louisiana focussing exclusively on the experience of the people who were forcibly enslaved there. \"These stories that we've been telling, they explain us to ourselves. You cannot understand the United States today without understanding our history with regard to race, slavery, relationships with Indigenous people and the genocides \u2013 all of these things that are 'bad'. We have to understand them, because they explain who we are today.\"\nWhere to visit:\nHere are three museums, that Werkheiser and the staff of Cultural Heritage Partners feel help to tell the story of US history, and could use visitor support.\n\u2022 Museum of the Cherokee People\n (Cherokee, NC) \u2013 One of the oldest tribally operated museums in the country, the museum's mission is \"to preserve and perpetuate the history, culture and stories of the Cherokee people\".\n\u2022 Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia\n (Richmond, VA) \u2013 Housed in the historic Leigh Street Armory, the institution highlights the history, culture and contributions of African Americans from Virginia, from civil rights heroes to Nascar's first Black race car driver.\n\u2022 National Museum of Women in the Arts\n (Washington DC) \u2013 From the 17th-Century work of Mary Beale to the modern rhinestone-encrusted portraits by Mickalene Thomas, this museum tells little-known stories of women in the arts.\nThe Whitney and other nearby locations, including a centuries-old sugar-cane plantation that once housed Africans and Creole people recently lost a bid to be designated as a National Historic Landmark District, a process that had been in the works for several years. The designation would have protected the Whitney and other historical sites from outside development, a necessary move as many in the local area had long wanted to clear the path for more industrial development, according to Rogers. She added that local government officials requested to have the application pulled from consideration once the Trump administration got in office.\nBoth Rogers and Werkheiser expressed concern that the budget cuts Trump is imposing on cultural institutions might have long-term repercussions. They stressed that even if funding cuts and DEI restrictions are ultimately overturned in court, they may still trigger a long-lasting drop in the financial stability of smaller institutions \u2013 especially those that seek to tell stories from diverse perspectives, which may not attract as many visitors as larger, more \"mainstream\" museums. Historians, scholars, artists and others employed by cultural institutions who carry this specialised knowledge are also at risk.\n\"These artefacts and the sites that represent our shared history, are vulnerable to destruction and to permanent loss, but I'm also worried that the people who preserve those histories are also irreplaceable,\" said Werkheiser. \"I'm very concerned about the scholars and government employees who have devoted their careers to preserving our country's cultural heritage. Many have lost their jobs or worried that they might soon be out of work, and we know that their knowledge and expertise are vital.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022 How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n\u2022 'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\nRogers and Werkheiser stressed the importance of institutions and individuals pushing back against these policies as much as possible. They also highlighted the role of visitors in helping to support cultural institutions that tell stories from diverse perspectives, particularly in difficult times.\n\"What's happening at [the] Whitney, the way that this administration's policies are affecting us, that is happening in everyone's local community,\" said Rogers. \"There is going to be a local museum, a local library [near you] who is really struggling, and they need our support more than ever right now.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect \u2013 and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.\nNear the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%.  Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.\nThis is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US. \nExports to the US contribute around 30% of Vietnam's GDP, and 25% of Cambodia's.\nThat growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.\nThe longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular.\nVietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\", where it attempts to be friends with everyone and balance ties with both China and the US, will now be tested.\nUnder the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. It has been aiming for annual growth rates in excess of 8%.\nExporting more to the US, already its biggest market, was central to that plan.\nIt was also the main reason why Vietnam agreed to elevate their relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.\nThe Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent and has no formal political opposition, depends on its economic pledges for its legitimacy. Already viewed by many economists as too ambitious, these will now be even harder to meet.\nThailand depends on US exports less than Vietnam \u2013 under 10% of GDP \u2013 but the Thai economy is in much worse shape, having underperformed for the past decade. The Thai government is trying to find ways to lift economic growth, most recently attempting but failing to legalise gambling, and these tariffs are another economic blow it cannot afford.\nFor Cambodia, the tariffs pose perhaps the greatest political threat in the region.\nThe government of Hun Manet has proved just as authoritarian as that of his father Hun Sen, whom he succeeded two years ago, but it is vulnerable.\nKeeping the Hun family's hold on power has required offering rival clans in Cambodia economic privileges like monopolies or land concessions, but this has helped create a glut of property developments, which are no longer selling, and a mass of grievances over land expropriations.\nThe garment sector, which employs 750,000 people, has been a crucial social safety valve, giving steady incomes to Cambodia's poorest. Thousands of those jobs are now likely to be lost as a result of President Trump's tariffs.\nUnlike China, which has hit back with its own levies, the official message from governments in South East Asia is don't panic, don't retaliate, but negotiate.\nVietnam has dispatched deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc to Washington to plead his country's case, and has offered to eliminate all tariffs on US imports. Thailand plans to send its finance minister to make a similar appeal, and has offered to reduce its tariffs and buy more American products, like food and aircraft. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also heading to Washington, though with  exports to the US making up only 11% of Malaysia's total, his country is less affected than some of its neighbours. \nHowever, the Trump administration appears to be in no mood to compromise.\nPeter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing and one of the main thinkers behind the new policy, said in interviews on Monday that Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs was meaningless, because it would not address the deficit in trade where Vietnam sells $15 worth of goods to the US for every $1 it buys.\nHe accused Vietnam of keeping multiple non-tariff barriers to US imports, and said that one-third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products, trans-shipped through Vietnam.\nThe proportion of Vietnamese exports which are being made or trans-shipped there to avoid US tariffs on China is difficult to assess, but detailed trade studies put it at between 7% and 16%, not one-third.\nLike Vietnam, the government of Cambodia has appealed to the US to postpone the tariffs while it attempts to negotiate.\nThe local American Chamber of Commerce has called for the 49% tariffs to be dropped, making the point that the Cambodian garment industry, the country's biggest employer, will be badly affected, but that no tariff level, however high, will see clothing and footwear manufacturing return to the US.\nPerhaps the most perverse tariff rate is the 44% applied to Myanmar, a country mired in a civil war, which has no capacity to buy more US goods.\nUS exports make up only a small proportion of Myanmar's GDP, less than 1%.\nBut as in Cambodia, that sector, mainly garments, is one of the few that provides a steady income to poor families in Myanmar's cities.\nIn a supreme irony,  Trump has until now been a popular figure in this region.\nHe has been widely admired in Vietnam for his tough, transactional approach to foreign policy, and Cambodia's former strongman Hun Sen, still the main power behind the scenes, has long sought a close personal relationship with the US president, proudly posting selfies with him at their first meeting in 2017.\nOnly last month Cambodia was praising  Trump for shutting down the US media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which often carried the views of Cambodian dissidents.\nNow Cambodia, like so many of its neighbours, finds itself in a long line of supplicants pleading with him to ease their tariff burden.",

        "article_text": "Jonathan Haidt's book, The Anxious Generation, sparked a global reckoning about mobile phone usage among children when it came out last year. So, I checked in with him to find out if he still thinks childhood is at risk from too much screen time.\nParents need help. I know from experience. It's really hard to get kids off their screens when all their friends are stuck on theirs. This addiction demands collective action.\nIn the days since I spoke with Haidt, there's been one thing that he said that I haven't been able to get off my mind.\u00a0\n\"I have not met one member of Gen Z who's in denial, who says, 'No, we love the phones, the phones are good for us,'\" Haidt told me. \"They all see what's happening, but they feel trapped.\"\u00a0\nSo, has anything actually changed in the year since Haidt's book? Was all the hype around mobile phones just a flash-in-the-pan moment of collective parental anxiety or did it produce the kind of action many parents are longing for?\nWatch our full conversation, here:\nBelow is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nKatty Kay: It's been a year since your book came out and caused a huge conversation. I wanted to start by getting a kind of report card of where we are on the various aspects of what you're trying to do: phones in school, age gating, social media, getting kids to have more free playtime. Who's doing well and who isn't in America on all of those issues?\u00a0\nJonathan Haidt: I knew that the book was going to be popular. What I wasn't prepared for is that this issue would spread like wildfire around the world, not just in the US. Because around the world, family life has turned into a fight over screen time. Everyone hates it. Everyone sees it.\nWhere it took off most quickly was phone-free schools, because that is something that is very easily done. It's so hard to teach to a classroom when half of them are watching short videos and playing video games. So, the teachers have hated the phones from the beginning but they were afraid, especially in America \u2013 maybe it's the same in the UK \u2013 but in America, there are a lot of parents who want to be able to communicate all the time with their child, and they think they have a right to check in on their child. And, 'What if something goes wrong? I need to be there.' So, the overparenting \u2014\nKK: That's a paradox, then, because you've got the parents who are super worried about the phones; they see what phones are doing to their kids. But they also don't want their kids to relinquish their phones when they go into school.\nJH: Hey, look, people are complicated! They contain multitudes. And I shouldn't say that everyone saw the problem, because there were a lot of parents who saw the phone as a lifeline. They see the world as very threatening and dangerous. And so, early on in this process, I thought there would be this uniquely American thing about overprotection, because we do have a lot more crime than you do in Europe or Canada.\u00a0\nBut the surprising thing, to me, as I've been studying this for a while now, is that the vast overprotection swept through all of the English-speaking countries in the '90s. So, all the English-speaking countries went through this at the same time. And now, all of them are taking action really quickly. UK and Australia, I'd say, are in the lead in terms of actually passing legislation.\nKK: Here in the United States, we've seen some battles go through Congress, but this has not happened at a national level. What I am seeing is individual states enact laws to stop kids having phones in school.\u00a0\nJH: That's right, because we don't have a functioning legislature in the United States. We have Congress. And Congress can't really do anything if anybody objects. So, from the beginning, I have not assumed we're going to get a damn bit of help from Congress. I've been focusing on the 50 US states and on the UK, Australia and the EU. If we get legislative change in those domains, we win.\nKK: Is it too early to see what the impact is in schools that ban phones? Do we have any data on that yet or is this just a supposition that they're going to do better?\u00a0\nJH: We have reports from schools that go phone-free. And I challenge people to look around for a school that went truly phone-free, not just during class time. If it's just a restriction during class time, that's not phone-free. That causes all kinds of problems. All the kids are on their phones in between classes. But truly phone-free, where you turn in phones in the morning and you get back in the evening, the reports are raves.\u00a0\nThe most common things they say are that discipline problems are down. There's just a lot less fighting, a lot less drama. Truancy is down. School is a lot more fun when you can actually talk with your friends and play with them and laugh with them. So, truancy goes down, tardiness goes down, kids arrive on time. And the most thrilling thing for me, and the most universal thing they say is we hear laughter in the hallways again. So, the reports are uniformly raves. There's often some resistance in the first week or two, but what they mostly say is \u2014\nKK: Who's the resistance from?\u00a0\nJH: Some of the kids don't like it and some of the parents don't like it. But I've spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school superintendents. What they're telling me is they expected a huge pushback from parents, but they actually didn't get it. Because this year is different. The zeitgeist has changed.\nActually, it started in the UK even before my book came out. You had smartphone-free schools; they went viral in February of last year and my book didn't come out until March. So, it's a different environment now, and schools are ready to act. Now, there are some studies, there are some academic studies that have been equivocal, but when you look at them \u2013 there was one that came out in the UK, it was published in the Lancet.\nIt said phone-free schools don't help. No, it didn't. It looked at like eight schools that had a backpack policy, which is not very good, and then like 11 or 15 schools that had a classroom-ban policy. It was like there was a slight difference in policies. These are very different schools. So, we have a Substack post showing this Lancet study doesn't show anything of the sort. There was a study in the UK done by Policy Exchange, where they looked at several hundred UK schools, and only about 10% are truly phone-free. If you look at the schools in the UK that are truly phone-free, and you compare them to the others, then you do find academic benefits and behavioural benefits.\nKK: I want to go back to something you said at the beginning about the 1990s and how that became a time of fear. I've been a working mother my whole life. I have four children: two of whom were born in the 90s, one was born in 2000, one was born in 2006. So, they've all had different experiences with screens. But from the research that I've done, something else happened in the kind of 80s and 90s, which was a sort of expansion of what we deem to be a good parent, and more specifically than that, a good mother, right? So, women were taking on full-time jobs and still doing the overwhelming share of household chores.\nBut it's not just that. In my research, women today are doing as much in the way of household chores as their great-grandmothers were in the early part of the 1900s. It's that society somehow deemed us not to be good parents if we weren't spending an enormous amount of time with our kids, spending our weekends running ragged taking them to events. And somehow you got, particularly perhaps if you were a working mother, the kind of guilt exploded. I feel like screens \u2013 and I've seen it with my own kids \u2013 screens just became a kind of form of relief for parents, and mothers in particular, from whom society was just asking impossible things.\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0Every word you said is true. I'll just try to add on to it. It is a puzzle. And I've got a really bizarre graph in the book showing that the amount of time that mothers and fathers spent parenting was fairly flat in the 80s and even into the 90s. And then all of a sudden in the mid 1990s, at least in the US, it jumped up. Something changed in the 90s. And it's the norm that you're talking about.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Great, I moved here in '96, so I just hit right at the right moment! [Laughter]\nJH:\u00a0You just hit it! That's right. So, that really did happen. Women today have fewer children than their grandmothers did, and they're working outside the home, which their grandmothers didn't, and they're spending more time with the kids. So, a lot of this has fallen on women.\u00a0\nNow, why did this happen? The best answer comes from this really wonderful book called Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi. He's a British sociologist and he's focusing on what happened in the UK, not the US, although he points out that the same things happened in the US and Canada. And what happened, he says, is we lost trust in other people. And when that happens, then we don't trust our neighbourhood. We don't trust people to send our kids out.\u00a0\nIt's always been the case that raising kids was kind of a joint project. When you lose that, now every family is on their own. And that means it's mostly the mothers who are on their own.\nKK:\u00a0In your sort of meta analysis of screens and kids and schools, and whether we can have phones in schools, is it actually the case that we have to address those issues before we can really wean our kids off this screen addiction?\nJH:\u00a0We have to understand those issues first if we want to fully understand what happened historically. But I would not say that we have to address those issues first, because, frankly, we're not going to address them. I mean reversing the decline of community, you know, I go to all kinds of meetings about that. There are all kinds of foundations. But look, technology changes society \u2014\nKK:\u00a0Can you just fix it all, Jon? [Laughter] I mean, I know you've done phones in schools, but really, step it up!\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0[Laughter] Yeah. Let's fix community next! So, no, we're not going to restore trust in our neighbours such that we can let our kids out. That's not going to happen. In fact, it's likely to get a lot worse as we go into the\u00a0era of AI, when we have no idea what's true. We're never going to know what's true again for a very long time, if ever. So, rather, we have to adapt to this. And I think the way we adapt to this onslaught of technology is by saying, \"Okay, you know what? Kids are not adults.\"\nWe have to focus on what it will take to allow kids to have healthy brain development through puberty. That's my mission. We've got to give kids a lot less screen time. A lot less fragmenting time. No TikTok. No short videos. That's the worst, and give them a lot more experience interacting with people.\nKK:\u00a0What do you say to poorer families where both parents have to work multiple jobs and for whom the invention of screen content that occupies their small children is just literally a lifesaver for them? Is there a different argument there or not?\nJH:\u00a0Yes, there is. So, the way to understand this is that in the 90s, when we were all techno-optimists, the internet was amazing. The early internet was amazing. And rich kids had computers and internet access and poor kids didn't. And so in the 1990s, we had a big thing, you know, it was educational equity.\u00a0Bill Gates, all kinds of philanthropists donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Let's get every kid a computer.\nSo, in the early 2000s, we're all techno-optimists and we think, 'Well, okay, I don't trust my kid to walk three blocks to a store, but he's on a computer. What could happen? He's learning! That's great!' We think it's good that our kids are upstairs on a computer. And, of course, this is one of the central ideas in the\u00a0Netflix show Adolescence\u00a0is, you know, parents think their kids are safe when they're on a computer. And in the 90s, they mostly were. There was some bad stuff, too, but they mostly were.\u00a0\nBut once the internet gets taken over, or at least once childhood gets\u00a0owned by three or four big companies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0TikTok, Snap, Meta and Google \u2013 once childhood is owned by these companies that are using algorithms to send them content, to keep them hooked, this is when things get much darker. Kids on computers now, they're not learning to program. They're not learning any useful skills. They're just basically lying there consuming content. And this is when it gets really sick and really dark.\nEditorial Note:\nTikTok told the BBC's Marianna Spring it has \"industry-leading\" safety settings for teens, and Meta cites its own tools for \"positive and age-appropriate experiences\". Read more about how social media companies address concerns of children's safety online, here.\nBut we don't quite realise that. And so what's happened now is the educational equity issue has reversed. It used to be \"get poor kids computers\". But by the 2000s, what was clear was that the rich people, and especially the people in Silicon Valley, don't let their kids have this stuff. So, now the great educational equity imperative is we've got to give the poor kids the same protections that the rich kids have. We've got to get them less time on screens. You said it's literally a lifesaver. I would say no, it's not literally a lifesaver. It literally is a brain-scrambler.\nKK: A lot of what you write about and the way you write is targeted at adults. If you were to go into schools and talk to middle school children, what would be the most effective argument you could make to them?\nJH: I'm glad you asked that, because just before our conversation, I was in an hour-long conversation with my team. We're creating a version of The Anxious Generation for 8-to-12 year olds, for kids who don't yet have a smartphone. And the main thing that we want to convey to them is that there are these companies that are going to try to hook you. And they've hooked most kids. If you look at the kids older than you, they're not having fun. They're lonely, they're sad. Because they all got sucked into just being content consumers, that's all they do. But do you want to have an amazing, exciting life? Do you want to do things? Do you want to have fun with your friends?\nDon't go down that route. Don't let these companies trick you and suck you in. One of the key ideas in The Anxious Generation is this is not a book about screens; this is a book about childhood. What kind of childhood do we want for our kids?\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0",

We have already seen SAOT in this season's Champions League and in the FA Cup from the fifth round onwards.When a tight offside decision goes to a VAR review, SAOT steps in.Previously, officials in the VAR room needed to decide on three key things - when the ball was kicked, where and at what angle the defender's body was when the ball was kicked and where and what angle the attacker's body was at the moment of contact.Viewers at home have seen this manual process played out with lines drawn with crosshairs on freeze-frame replays shown on their TV screens.All three of those decisions will now be automatically taken by the technology to remove some elements of human subjectivity, such as which frame to freeze as the ball is kicked.Bespoke cameras have been installed beneath the roof at all 20 Premier League stadiums to monitor a variety of key elements.About 30 cameras - working at 100 frames per second - will track the exact movement of the ball as well as 10,000 data points on the bodies of all 22 players.It means it can be automatically determined whether an attacking player's body was beyond the last defender at the exact time the ball was played.VAR officials check the system has correctly determined the three key points it measures before confirming the decision.

        "article_text": "The resentencing hearing of Menendez brothers can move forward despite opposition from the district attorney, a Los Angeles court has ruled.\nThe brothers' attorneys are attempting to have them resentenced to a lesser term, which could potentially make them eligible for freedom.\nErik and Lyle were convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989, a notorious case that still divides Americans. They are currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole in California.\nFriday's ruling means a pair of high-profile hearings next week to decide whether the convicted killers will be resentenced,  will continue. \nLos Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has voiced fierce opposition to resentencing the pair, after his predecessor put the process in motion just before the November election.\nThe brothers' effort is based on a California law that allows certain inmates who were aged under 26 at the time of their crimes to seek resentencing and potential parole eligibility - recognising that brain development continues into a person's mid-20s.\nIf the brothers are resentenced to 50 years to life as they have requested, it would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nLyle and Erik Menendez appeared for hearing remotely via a video stream from a San Diego prison. Both were dressed in blue prison jumpsuits and appeared nervous at times - looking down, rocking in chairs and taking deep breaths - as prosecutors recounted graphic details of the killings.\nThe district attorney's office argued that while prosecutors can recognise inmates have rehabilitated while behind bars, the act of resentencing someone should be used with care.\nDeputy District Attorney Habib Balian criticised the former DA George Gasc\u00f3n, whose backing of the resentencing effort allowed it to move forward. \nHe said the decision by Gasc\u00f3n to announce his support for the brothers to be resentenced just before the November election, which Gasc\u00f3n lost to Hochman by a wide margin, was politically driven.\nThe DA's office has argued the brothers have not fully taken responsibility and have continued to grasp at alleged lies in the case to shed blame.\nMark Geragos, an attorney for the Menendez brothers, argued that the district attorney's office was more concerned with re-litigating the previous trial and hadn't examined what the pair had been doing the last 35 years in prison. \nThe pair had completed schooling while behind bars and worked to start rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates, along with incarcerated individuals suffering with trauma, he said.\nThe judge ruled that prosecutors failed to show why the resentencing effort should not continue and emphasised the importance of maintaining consistency even with shifts in leadership.\n\"There's no new information,\" the judge said. \"None of this is really new. They've stuck with their story. It goes to whether they've been rehabilitated.\"\nThe case was thrust back into the public eye last year as new evidence emerged and the release of a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.\nThe series introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.\nLegal experts say the outcome of the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing could take several forms, depending on how the judge rules. \nThe most straightforward path would be to deny resentencing altogether, leaving their current sentence\u2014life without the possibility of parole\u2014intact. This is the outcome Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman is pushing for, arguing the brothers have not fully accepted responsibility for their crimes and therefore don't qualify for a reduced sentence.\nAlternatively, the court could side with former DA George Gasc\u00f3n's earlier recommendation and resentence the brothers to 50 years to life. This would make them immediately eligible for parole, as they've already served more than 30 years. But eligibility doesn't guarantee release; they would still need to convince a parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nAnother possibility is that the judge opts for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe resentencing bid is one of three routes the brothers have been chasing in recent months in hopes of being freed.\nCalifornia Gov Gavin Newsom is still weighing another option: granting the brothers clemency.\nNewsom said the brothers were scheduled to appear before the state's parole board on 13 June to discuss the findings of a risk assessment he'd ordered, examining whether Erik and Lyle pose a danger to society.\nDepending on the results, the governor could grant clemency, commuting their sentences to make them eligible for parole or even releasing them outright.\nThe third route the brothers have eyed - asking for a new trial - hit a roadblock when Hochman's office announced they would oppose the request.",

        "article_text": "Chef Ruben Bond\u00ec knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church, in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving \u2013 and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bond\u00ec, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, the tradizione giudaico-romanesca (Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset of Roman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bond\u00ec, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Maurizio Fiorino)\nRuben Bond\u00ec is a Roman chef and food influencer whose cooking videos have earned him more than four million followers on social media. In 2023, he published a cookbook on Jewish Roman cuisine, Cucina con Ruben.\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes \u2013 expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy \u2013 from carciofi alla giudia (fried artichokes) to stracotto (braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing \u2013 typical [Jewish] dishes like concia di zucchine [marinated fried courgettes] and abbacchio [roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history \u2013 from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 \u2013 Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so] the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto \u2013 sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace \u2013 is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bond\u00ec's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae \u2013 the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol \u2013 Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\nDon't get your artichokes off-season\nWhile artichokes may be the undeniable star of the Roman Jewish kitchen, Bond\u00ec recommends visitors only consume the vegetable when it's in harvest. \"Avoid getting artichokes when they're off-season,\" he advises. \"You won't be served Italian artichokes, and they won't be as fresh. You should only get them when it's artichoke season, so from November-December to May.\"\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples is carciofi alla giudia \u2013 a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes like spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches in Venice, Florence and Milan. Its main restaurant \u2013 a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures \u2013 does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearby Ba'Ghetto Milky.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram: @baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institution Renato al Ghetto \u2013 where Bond\u00ec worked as a waiter in his younger days \u2013 realised it could replicate its success with street food, its\u00a0hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosette are a type of Roman bap,\" Bond\u00ec says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beef stracotto or Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chicken alla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under \u20ac12 (\u00a310).\n\"It's very good,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S. Maria del Pianto, 63, 00186\nPhone: +39 338 859 3395\nInstagram: @rosetteria_renato_al_ghetto\n\"Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,\" Ruben says. \"And for meat lovers, I recommend BellaCarne.\"\nLocated a mere block from the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, the restaurant's name itself is particularly promising \u2013 translating literally to \"Beautiful Meat\" \u2013 and its dishes definitely live up to expectations.\n\"I can especially vouch for their grilled meats,\" Bond\u00ec says, which include scottadito lamb and veal chops.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut while meat in all its forms \u2013 roast, fried, stewed and braised \u2013 is the undeniable star, it isn't the only thing worth ordering.\n\"They have an excellent vegan crostata [tart] for dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says, made with almond paste and sour cherries.\nRoman Jewish food may be humble by nature, but BellaCarne offers a decidedly refined dining experience, set in a chic, wood-panelled interior. As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.bellacarne.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 51, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 683 3104\nInstagram: \n@bellacarne/\nThe dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expressly casereccio \u2013 homestyle, homemade.\nCasalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.\n\"It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nThe restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successful Dolce Kosher bakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.\nAmong its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia. Bond\u00ec emphatically recommends Casalino's roasts, but notes that the Zarfati family tightly guards the recipe.\n\"It's a secret,\" he says.\nWebsite: https://casalinoosteriakosher.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 1e, 00186\nPhone number: +39 06 7978 1514\nInstagram: @casalino.osteriakosher/\nWhile most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together), Il Giardino Romano has adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate.\n\"It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nAs its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (\"The Roman Garden\") has a green thumb \u2013 its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which Bond\u00ec calls the restaurant's speciality.\nThe mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use \u2013 from fettuccine alle vongole (pasta with clams) to cacio e pepe to even more idiosyncratic pairings.\n\"[Il Giardino Romano] has a particularly unique dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"A ricotta crostata with artichoke.\"\nAnd if the menu does not succeed in evoking the bucolic delights of the Roman orchard, its setting certainly will \u2013 the restaurant has a small brick courtyard covered in trees and hanging ivy.\nWebsite:https://www.ilgiardinoromano.com\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia 18, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 6880 9661\nInstagram: @ristorante_il_giardino_romano/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A saliva test may help \"turn the tide\" on prostate cancer, UK scientists claim. \nIt analyses men's DNA to work out who was born with the greatest risk of developing the disease. \nTargeting them for prostate biopsies and MRI scans discovered some aggressive cancers that would otherwise have gone unnoticed.\nHowever, the test has not yet been proven to save lives and experts say it will be  \"years\" before such tests could be used routinely. \nAround 12,000 men in the UK die from prostate cancer every year. \nCalls for the routine testing of healthy men - known as screening - have grown louder since Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy announced he had terminal prostate cancer.   \nScreening has been rejected in the past because using the current test - which looks for levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood - risks causing more harm than good. \nThis saliva test does not look for signs of prostate cancer inside the body. \nInstead it looks for 130 mutations in men's DNA, each of which can increase the risk of prostate cancers developing.  \nIn the study, scientists tested men aged 55-69 and calculated their risk. Men in the top 10% of scores were invited for further investigations. This included a biopsy and an MRI scan. \nThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed:\n\"With this test, it could be possible to turn the tide on prostate cancer,\" said Prof Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London. \n\"We can identify men at risk of aggressive cancers who need further tests and spare the men who are at lower risk from unnecessary treatments,\" she added\nDheeresh Turnbull, who is 71 and from Brighton, took part in the trial. \nHe discovered he was in the highest risk category despite having no family history of prostate cancer. Further examination showed he had cancer. \n\"I was completely shocked, I would never have been diagnosed at this stage if I hadn't joined the trial.\"\nHis younger brother was then invited to take part in the study and also discovered he had an aggressive tumour. \n\"It's incredible to think that because of this study two lives have now been saved in my family,\" Dheeresh said.\nHowever, the test is not ready to be rolled out. \nProf Dusko Ilic, from King's College London, said it was \"promising\" but improved cancer detection \"only modestly\" when used alongside current risk factors such as age, PSA levels and MRI scans. \nAnd he said there was still \"no direct evidence\" of it improving survival or quality of life, which meant more studies were needed.\nThe research also focused people of European ancestry and work is still under way to adapt it for people from other backgrounds. Black men are thought to have double the risk of prostate cancer. \nThe research team also say there are questions around cost-effectiveness, potential harms and the best time to analyse the risk.\nThe saliva test will become part of the pivotal Transform trial which is trying to discover the best way of introducing prostate cancer screening in the UK. \nProf Michael Inouye, from the University of Cambridge, said he believes we will look back on this study \"as a landmark\" that made the case for using genetics to assess risk.\nBut he added: \"This is a big step along the path to clinical implementation, but it is still a long road.\"\nHe said it will \"likely be years\" before the NHS used such a test. \nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.",

        "article_text": "Novak Djokovic's 18 Monte Carlo main draw appearances is an Open era record for the event\nNovak Djokovic's wait for a 100th ATP singles title continues after he exited the Monte Carlo Masters in a \"horrible\" straight-set opening loss to Alejandro Tabilo.\nDjokovic, a two-time winner of the event, made 29 unforced errors compared to his 18 winners in a subdued start to the 37-year-old's clay-court season, resulting in a 6-3 6-4 defeat.\nThe record 24-time men's major champion had won the last 10 matches he had contested on clay - including his run to Olympic gold in July.\nBut Chilean Tabilo, who beat Djokovic on the surface at the Italian Open 11 months ago, replicated that surprise victory to reach the third round.\n\"I expected myself at least to have put in a decent performance. Not like this, it was horrible,\" Serbia's Djokovic said.\n\"I did not have high expectations. I knew I'm going to have a tough opponent and I knew I'm going to probably play pretty bad. But this bad, I didn't expect.\n\"I was hoping it was not going to happen, but it was quite a high probability I'm going to play this way.\n\"A horrible feeling to play this way, just sorry for all the people that have to witness this.\"\nEarlier on Wednesday, Carlos Alcaraz rallied to a comeback victory over Francisco Cerundolo in the 21-year-old's first clay match of the season.\nSpanish world number three Alcaraz was unable to match Argentine Cerundolo in the first set but dominated thereafter, winning 12 of the last 13 games for a 3-6 6-0 6-1 victory.\nNorwegian fourth seed Casper Ruud beat Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 6-1 to reach the third round, while Russian seventh seed Andrey Rublev overcame Frenchman Gael Monfils 6-4 7-6 (7-2).\nAustralian eighth seed Alex de Minaur came from behind to defeat Czech Tomas Machac, while Russian ninth seed Daniil Medvedev beat Alexandre Muller of France, also in three sets.\nGreat Britain's Jack Draper is back in action on Thursday, when the Indian Wells champion faces Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina for a quarter-final place.\nGB's Draper cruises into Monte Carlo third round\nGB bid for BJK Cup finals place - watch live on BBC\nRublev hopes for 'really long' Safin partnership\nDjokovic is aiming to become only the third man in the Open era - after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer - to win 100 Tour-level titles, having reached 99 by completing a career 'Golden Slam' at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\nBut, after being stunned by Czech teenager Jakub Mensik in the Miami Open final in his previous attempt at reaching the landmark, that wait goes on for Djokovic.\nMaking his 18th appearance in Monte Carlo, the 2013 and 2015 champion made the perfect start by breaking Tabilo's serve in the opening game.\nBut world number 32 Tabilo once again had the measure of the former world number one, against whom he has now achieved the two biggest wins of his career.\nThe 27-year-old produced an excellent response following his early setback, twice breaking an out-of-sorts Djokovic to turn the first set around.\nTabilo then struck what proved the decisive blow in the third game of set two, with Djokovic conceding on a second break point after inviting pressure with costly errors.\nThe Serb attempted to hang on, but Tabilo saved two break points to move within one game of victory before sealing it on his second match point.\nSet to face Bulgarian 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov next, Tabilo said: \"It has been a tough year, so a little bit of the nerves were there.\n\"I remembered last time what I did well and thankfully I served well today and it helped me a lot.

        "article_text": "From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.\nWhile much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.\nThis is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't find Rome or London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finally found its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's caused tourism upheaval \u2013 and rows with locals \u2013 in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.\nThese are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.\nPuglia saw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays \u2013 still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.\n\"The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authentic masserie\u00a0(farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,\" says California-based travel advisor and photographer Coco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. \"The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites like Alberobello make it exceptional,\" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience the Jubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events in Rome.\nTran recommends booking a table at cliff-side Osteria Sant'Anna in Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter through Lecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran says Masseria Torre Coccaro remains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves \u2013 plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.\u00a0\nBest time to visit: Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.\nPortugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation than Porto and Lisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is the Alentejo coast, which experienced its best tourism year on record in 2024.\n\"Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,\" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey \u2013 especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.\nWho picked the list?\nStacey Leasca is an award-winning travel journalist living in Lisbon, Portugal, with two decades of experience covering destinations across Europe and beyond. She served as adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Southern California and is a PhD candidate specialising in building resiliency to disinformation in journalism.\u00a0\nThe area's \"mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe\" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price of\u00a0ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.\n\u00c9vora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famed\u00a0Festas dos Santos Populares\u00a0(Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself at\u00a0Craveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm \u2013 including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.\nBest time to visit:\u00a0Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through the\u00a0Fisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.\u00a0\nAbout five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier \u2013 both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks \u2013 specifically, Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (\u00a389.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.\nHowever, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride the Glacier Express train through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel \u2013 including a seemingly endless supply of fondue \u2013 and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxurious Chedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for the Post Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.\nBest time to visit: Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.\nCap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the C\u00f4ted'Azur \u2013 an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy \u2013 and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.\nThe iconic Belles Rives hotel \u2013 Fitzgerald's home for part of the 1920s \u2013 is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. \"The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,\" says Andria Mitsakos, founder of AMPR, which represents the property.\nBeyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts the Juan-les-Pins International Jazz Festival in July, when Bastille Day celebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend the Festival International d'Art Sacr\u00e9, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as the Picasso Museum and the Chapelle Matisse.\nBest time to visit: The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.\nWhile Italy continues to grapple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery, cultural depth and fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named a European Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.\nAt just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a \"small but mighty country\", says James Montie, branch manager at Fox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, \"from Lake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave\", are a primary draw, he adds.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n\u2022 Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n\u2022 Here's how to safely visit glacier sites around the world\nIndependent travel advisor Kimberly Denison agrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds \"Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,\" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that 60% of the country's surface area is forest and it was certified as the world's first green destination in 2016.\nTo explore its glorious landscapes, hike Triglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting at Vila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.\nBest time to visit: The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.\nThe Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine \u2013 specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.\nOf the Peloponnese's three peninsulas, Mani \u2013 the rugged middle finger \u2013 stands out. \"Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani is Greece's best-kept secret,\" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. \"This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance.\" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with \"a deep-rooted history\", she adds. Stay at Pirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century tower\u00a0turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.\nElsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.\nBest time to visit: Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.\nParis had quite the 2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever; since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for the banlieues (suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.\nWhat parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel at Goway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. \"Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,\" he explains, \"but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture \u2013 there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too.\" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks to Notre Dame reopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classic H\u00f4tel du Savoir, formerly called the H\u00f4tel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and is, let's just say, tr\u00e9s chic.\nBest time to visit: Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.\nTourism to Sweden has surged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the \"coolcation\" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.\nWhile many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think granite islands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light \u2013 minus the crowds and queues of the capital.\nIt's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, with Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded the EU's Mission Label for its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in at Hotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, the Bohusl\u00e4n archipelago beckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.\nBest time to visit: June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.\nAlbania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record 11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest in lesser-known Mediterranean escapes \u2013 which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.\n\"Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,\" says Denison. \"The Unesco-listed town of Gjirokast\u00ebr, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.\"\nNew infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including the Green Coast Hotel near the Unesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. \"Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,\" Denison adds.\nWhile hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, the Accursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays like La Brisa Boutique Hotel in Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the new Marriott in the Vlora Marina (expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.\nBest time to visit: The summer months are prime time in Albania \u2013 and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.\nWant to explore even further?

And he ranks second in Ligue 1 for completed dribbles with 74, behind Paris St-Germain's Desire Doue with 79.\nThere are also training videos of Cherki with France Under-21s, where he displays equal ability to control and volley a ball with both feet. \n\"He is two-footed, has no fear, keeps going and going, can get past people with such ease, such finesse,\" says Maitland-Niles.\n\"He is now working for the team off the ball and has gone to another level this season.\"\nIn an in-depth interview with BBC Sport, Maitland-Niles also talks about why Arsenal are too reliant on Saka, success under Jose Mourinho at Roma, moving to France and why Lyon will show Manchester United \"respect\". \nMaitland-Niles has been a near ever-present for Lyon and played 34 matches in all competitions this season\nAfter becoming the second youngest Arsenal player to appear in the Champions League, Maitland-Niles thought he would be at his boyhood club his entire life. \nThe defender had been in the Arsenal academy since the age of six and grew up supporting the club but opted to leave on a free transfer to Lyon in 2023. \n\"Life has obviously taken a different turn,\" he says. \"I thought I'd have been in the Premier League my whole career and things obviously didn't go to plan with Arsenal.\n\"But I'm thankful to the club and they didn't put any blockages when it came to leaving. I left as, like most footballers, I wanted to play.\"\nBut why not join another Premier League club? \nHe says: \"I told my agent not to tell me which clubs were interested but just the ones with firm offers. \n\"Lyon were the first to come in and it was such a big club showing their trust and belief in me. It was hard to turn down and it was a good time to try something different. I was at a point where I needed to be shown a lot of love and thought it was a good fit for me. \n\"Of course, I am happy with where I am at this point in time. But who is to say what might come up? In the meantime, I am very happy here and enjoying every moment.\n\"I am still that same player as I was at Arsenal but now with a stronger mindset and more consistency and I know what it takes to succeed.\"\nMaitland-Niles won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2020\nA debut under legendary manager Arsene Wenger, a Europa League final start under Unai Emery in 2019, winning the FA Cup with Mikel Arteta in 2020 and winning five England caps all rank among the major landmarks in Maitland-Niles' journey.\n\"I'm still an Arsenal fan, I watch most of our games and I lived a boyhood dream by winning an FA Cup final at Wembley for the club. [That] was the pinnacle. I supported Arsenal since I was six. I wish them well,\" he adds. \nBut the FA Cup under Arteta, who he regards as a \"tactical genius in Pep Guardiola's mould\", is the last trophy Arsenal have won. \n\"[Arteta] really studied how Pep took football to new heights as one of the best managers in the world,\" he says. \"He really studied how to break down teams and be most effective in games.\n\"Arsenal are showing that at this point, not coming close enough to win the league but you can see they are making big improvements by going close two years in a row.\"\nOn his relationship with Arteta, the defender adds: \"I wouldn't say there was anything special there. I had respect for him as a manager, I thought he was a tactical genius but it was an average player-manager relationship, not especially close.\"\nMaitland-Niles also admits it is \"frustrating\" the club has not followed up that FA Cup success but gives his backing to Arteta, while adding star attacker Saka needs support.\n\"I think they now rely on him a bit too much and you can't expect so much from such a young player,\" he says.\n\"He hasn't even hit his prime yet. But I think he is the driving force of the team and they miss a bit of attacking threat when he is not playing.\n\"Bukayo has become one of the world's best wingers, very consistent, knows how to kill off a game and he can pick his moment in a genius way.\"\nAttacker Ethan Nwaneri, 18, is having his breakthrough this season and could be one option to help Saka.\n\"Physically, he is absolutely incredible and there is no fear in the kid,\" continues Maitland-Niles.  \n\"He is just going at people and trying to make things happen. You can see he is trying to become a leader very early in that team. He is trying to cement his place which is difficult as he plays in the same positions as [Martin] Odegaard and Saka. \n\"But he has got the ability to do so as well. He has the world at his feet and he just needs to take his chance.\"\nAnother landmark for Maitland-Niles was winning the Conference League under Mourinho during a successful six-month loan stint at Roma.\n\"He is a really funny guy,\" says Maitland-Niles. \"The stories Jose gave us about his previous dressing rooms and how he has won cup finals and loads of different leagues - that is an experience you can take something from.\n\"There are a lot of players that would say they love him or hate him. But he is a great guy and what you see is what you get.\"\nMaitland-Niles achieved European success in the Conference League for Jose Mourinho's Roma in 2022\nMaitland-Niles, who is becoming one of the leaders at Lyon, has warned Thursday's Europa League opponents Manchester United that \"people don't realise how big Lyon are\".\n\"We are a historically big club,\" he adds. \"Considering where we were last season, it has been a great year but we need to be addicted to winning, push for more and aim for the Champions League.\"\nMaitland-Niles also says Lyon will try to show Ruben Amorim's United side \"respect but just not too much respect\".\nHe adds: \"They are not having the greatest season but have players like Bruno (Fernandes) and (Christian) Eriksen can run over you if you show too much respect. \n\"We have a great team, great manager and team spirit. We will not be scared, we'll give it our all and believe we can win.\"\nOf course, returning to England for the second leg will also prove exciting.\nHe says: \"As an Englishman, it will be nice to go home. Old Trafford is nothing short of what they call it, the Theatre of Dreams - it can be a dream for you but it can crush your dreams, too.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has announced sweeping changes to his import tax regime to allow time for trade talks.\nA 90-day pause will be applied to countries that were facing tariffs over the 10% baseline. China, however, will see an even larger hike with tariffs on its imports rising to 125%.\nPresident Trump had been justifying his tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\". \nHowever, several of his claims about global trade were unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\nBefore the 90-day pause, Trump claimed \"we're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\".\nHe made the claim on Tuesday, one day before the pause. Trump then repeated the figure in front of reporters following the latest changes, saying \"we're now making  $2bn a day\" - although he did not specifically link the number to tariffs.\nBut BBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 8 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $192m (\u00a3149m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based his claim on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs - after the initial announcement  - was 22%. \nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level. \nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April - when the global tariffs were initially announced. \nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day. \nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. \nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported. \nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. \nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nTrump also claimed Canada charges higher tariffs after the \"first two cartons of milk\". Al Mussell, from Agri-Food Economic Systems, told BBC Verify that tariff-quotas are typically measured in tonnes.\n\"I suppose the president was joking but in any event,  it's not a couple of cartons\", he said. \nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\". \n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said. \nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false. \nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false. \nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA.  \nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Rising tensions in the east African country of South Sudan, culminating in the 26 March arrest of Vice-President Riek Machar, have sparked concerns that the world's youngest nation is heading for another civil war.\nHis party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement In Opposition (SPLM-IO), has said that his house arrest \"effectively brings\u2026 to a collapse\" the fragile 2018 peace agreement that ended five years of fighting.\nSouth Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries, gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of struggle led by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), now under President Salva Kiir.\nJust two years into independence, a civil war erupted when Kiir dismissed Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup.\nThe ensuing conflict, largely fought along ethnic lines between supporters of the two leaders, resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths and 2.5 million people being forced from their homes \u2013 more than a fifth of the population.\nAs part of the peace deal, Machar was reinstated as vice-president within a unity government that was meant to pave the way for elections.\nThe current crisis was sparked at the beginning of March when the White Army militia, which was allied to Machar during the civil war, clashed with the army in Upper Nile state and overran a military base in Nasir.\nThen on 7 March a UN helicopter attempting to evacuate troops came under fire, leaving several dead, including a high-ranking army general.\nNearly three weeks later, Machar and several of his associates were arrested. They were accused of trying to stir up a rebellion.\n\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, deputy leader of SPLM-IO, said at the time.\nWhile Machar's inclusion in the unity government was a key part of the agreement, other parts of it have not been implemented.\nThe key issue for many South Sudanese is the security arrangement.\nThe deal outlined how former rebel forces and government soldiers would be brought together into a unified national army made up of 83,000 troops. The remainder were supposed to be disarmed and demobilised.\nBut this has not happened and there are still lots of militias aligned to different political groups.\nThe deal also outlined the establishment, with the help of the African Union, of a court meant to try the perpetrators of the violence. But this has not been created, in part because those holding some of the top positions in government are reluctant to set up something that could see them put on trial.\nElections that were supposed to happen in 2022 have still not taken place and neither has a new constitution been drawn up.\nWhile Kiir and Machar, both in their 70s, were part of the SPLM that fought for independence, long-standing tensions exist.\nThese have been fuelled by ethnic divisions \u2013 Kiir is Dinka, while Machar is Nuer \u2013 and competing political ambitions.\nWhen Kiir sacked Machar in 2013, triggering the civil war, Machar denounced him as a \"dictator\".\nCreating further problems between the two are the repeated postponements of elections. Polls have been delayed four times, leaving Machar unable to fulfil his presidential ambitions.\nBorn in 1952, the 72-year-old was the 27th son of the chief of Ayod and Leer and was brought up in the Presbyterian Church.\nAs an undergraduate, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Khartoum and in 1984 earned a PhD in philosophy and strategic planning at the UK's Bradford University.\nHe switched sides on several occasions during the battle to secede from Sudan, as he sought to strengthen his position and that of his Nuer ethnic group. \nHe became vice-president of South Sudan at independence in 2011. Machar was sacked in 2013 and then reinstated as part of a deal in 2016, but then fled as fighting resumed.\nBorn in 1951, the 73-year-old devout Roman Catholic was the son of a cattle herder and the eighth of nine children.\nAt 17, he joined the Anyanya, one of the rebel groups that was fighting for southern independence during the First Sudanese Civil War in 1967. Sixteen years later - in the Second Sudanese Civil War - he was one of the five founding members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement.\nThe former rebel commander, who specialised in military intelligence, was seen as a moderate within the SPLM and became its leader in 2005 after the death of John Garang in a helicopter crash\nHe became president of South Sudan on independence and has remained in that position for 14 years as no elections have taken place.\nNicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, has warned the country is \"teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war\", which would devastate the nation that is still dealing with the aftermath of the last conflict.\nThere are concerns that a return to fighting could lead to \"proxy warfare in the region\", according to Daniel Akech, an analyst at the Crisis Group think-tank.\n\"South Sudan is filled with so many armed groups, they're all seeming to be gearing up for military engagement.\"\nThe war in neighbouring Sudan adds another element of instability.\nThe leaders of the members of the regional grouping Igad \u2013 including Uganda - are supposed to be the guarantors of the 2018 deal.\nUganda's President Yoweri Museveni was in Juba recently and met Kiir, but the outcome of their discussions is not known.\nUgandan troops were also deployed to the country last month. South Sudan's government said the deployment was part of a long-standing agreement with its neighbour and the soldiers are there to support the army. \nAn African Union delegation was also in the capital and, as well as talking to the president, diplomats hoped to sit down with Machar \u2013 but that did not happen. There has been not a statement from the AU in the wake of the visit.\nWestern embassies \u2013 including the US and the UK \u2013 have released statements calling for the de-escalation of tensions, but it is not clear what impact these have had.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Liam Delap is the son of former Premier League midfielder Rory Delap and had spells on loan with Hull, Preston and Stoke before joining Ipswich\nIpswich striker Liam Delap will be available for \u00a330m this summer because of a relegation release clause, which will be triggered when his club inevitably returns to the Championship.\nThe 22-year-old is likely to move on, with interest from several Premier League sides after netting 12 goals in 33 games in all competitions in his first full season in the top flight. \nPreviously, multiple sources told BBC Sport that Delap was expected to be available for \u00a340m in the summer - with his previous club Manchester City holding a 'buy-back' fee at that price.\nHowever, sources at Ipswich have since confirmed to BBC Sport that the release clause value decreases by \u00a310m upon relegation. \nThe Suffolk club lost 2-1 in a key relegation match against Wolves last weekend which has left them 12 points away from safety with only seven games left.\nManager Kieran McKenna accepted relegation \"looks more than likely\".\nDelap has delivered a series of impressive performances this season and his release clause looks like good value.\nPaul MacDonald of FootballTransfers.com says Ipswich spent \"significantly\" above Delap's market value of \u00a36.5m last summer, which was another example of City \"extracting maximum value for their excellent youth production line\".\nHe says the \u00a330m release clause is about right for Delap's current market value given his lack of European and senior international experience and the fact he has had one \"breakout\" season.\nThat is, however, balanced against his age and a \"Premier League premium for English forwards\".\nSo which clubs could make a move for him in the summer? \nFrom Championship to England contention - the rise of 'fearless' Delap\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport chief football news reporter:\nThere is no doubt Manchester United will be one of the clubs with a major interest in Delap this summer.\nThe release clause is less than United paid for Rasmus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee, and Delap has scored more goals than either forward in the Premier League this season. Delap also fits Ruben Amorim's system and the United coach has frequently said his team do not score enough.\nOn that basis, and because talk of a move for Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres is now going cold, a transfer is a no-brainer.\nThe problem for United is the uncertainty over how much money they will have to spend in the summer - they will either earn Champions League qualification via winning the Europa League... or have no European football at all.\nAmorim has said he needs to assess gaps in his squad and where his priorities lie. \nUnited also know there will be a lot of competition for Delap and that could drive the price up beyond \u00a330m, and will drive wages up. It is one of the reasons why they are quite keen to offload high-earners Casemiro and Marcus Rashford this summer, because the comparison with their salaries doesn't help in negotiations either.\nDelap to United could definitely happen. But it is not nailed on.\nBBC Sport football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella:\nChelsea sources have signalled interest in Delap in recent months. \nManager Enzo Maresca worked with him in Manchester City's academy team. Similarly, so did influential recruiter Joe Shields and new academy technical director Glenn van der Kraan. \nThose personal relationships make the Stamford Bridge club serious contenders for his signature, but they are reportedly also interested in RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting's Gyokeres. \nThe new Chelsea regime are also known to prefer signing players that have release clauses written into their contracts.\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport chief football news reporter:\nCity had a \u00a340m buy-back agreement on Delap when they sold him to Ipswich last summer.\nThey also have a 20% sell-on clause on any profit Ipswich make beyond the \u00a320m they initially spent.\nWith Erling Haaland tied to a contract that does not expire until 2034, Omar Marmoush impressing since his winter arrival from Eintracht Frankfurt and Jeremy Doku and Savinho both in favour with Pep Guardiola this season in wide positions, it does not appear City have room for Delap in a way that would offer regular starts, which surely has to be a key selling point.\nIn addition, even with five Champions League spots for English teams, it is not certain City will be in Europe's top competition next season, which is a factor.\nOn that basis City would be unlikely to make a move, although, with a new technical director in Hugo Viana and a summer rebuild on the cards, that does bring an element of the unknown.\nBBC Sport pundit Chris Sutton:\nFor \u00a330m, of course a lot of big teams will be looking at him.\nIt would be a risk going to United with the lack of creativity that they have, but he would be an upgrade on what they have got.\nCompared to Chelsea's main striker, Nicolas Jackson, he is far more physical. He can still run in behind defences but is far more of an all-rounder. Part of the game which I think he could improve is aerially, considering he is 6ft 1in (1.85m).\nWhat I really like is that he has got that sort of swagger about him, and that attitude where he knows he is good, which you need at the bigger clubs.\nHe is too good for Ipswich. I don't want to upset their fans but he was a good signing and a brilliant bit of business for them, and they have enjoyed watching him play. Nobody is going to begrudge him leaving to go to a bigger club.\nIf he went to somewhere like Chelsea or Manchester United then he could be another player who bites Pep in the backside, like Cole Palmer did.\nBut going back to City behind other forwards is not going to help his development, or his England chances.\nArsenal have been linked heavily with Sesko and Gyokeres but not Delap. \nWest Ham are known to want a striker in the summer while Aston Villa and Newcastle could emerge as suitors.\nVilla sold striker Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr in January but signed Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United as a replacement. \nNewcastle striker Callum Wilson is out of contract in the summer and Alexander Isak is continually linked with a move away, despite sources at St James' Park insisting he is not for sale. \nMuch could also come down to the PSR positions of the various clubs and which teams gain the lucrative windfall for qualifying for the Champions League next season. \nLatest Ipswich Town news, analysis and fan views\nGet Ipswich news notifications",

We are more than capable to score two or three goals at home.\"\nVilla's goalscorer Morgan Rogers - who gave them the lead at the Parc des Princes - told TNT Sports: \"There's loads of belief in the changing room.\n\"We have nothing to lose, nobody thought we'd win the tie in the first place. Why not just go for it?\"\nMendes' late strike puts PSG in control against Villa\nWilliam takes eldest son George to watch Villa in Paris\nThis video can not be played\nRogers rounds off team move to give Villa shock lead at PSG\nSo, what chance do Villa have of hauling themselves back into this tie and even winning it?\nIt should be noted that similar comebacks have been achieved before.\nNine teams have been exactly two goals down after an away leg in a knockout Champions League tie and managed to successfully turn things around at home.\nThe most recent to do that were Juventus, who lost 2-0 at Atletico Madrid in the 2018-19 last-16 stage but won their second leg 3-0.\nParis St-Germain have twice surrendered two-goal leads at the halfway stage of a Champions League knockout tie to be eliminated - the most of any club. It occurred for them against Chelsea in 2013-14 and against Manchester United in 2018-19.\nFamously, PSG once surrendered a four-goal first-leg advantage against Barcelona, winning 4-0 at home but losing 6-1 at the Nou Camp.\nThat happened in 2016-17 when the French side were managed by Emery, and when PSG's current boss Luis Enrique was in charge of Barcelona.\nCould the comeback roles be reversed this time? The prospects look slim.\nParis St-Germain have been formidable on the road this season, winning on their last 16 away trips in all competitions.\nDefenders Marquinhos and Presnel Kimpembe are the only two players from the PSG squad who were stunned by Barcelona eight years ago who are still at the club.\nFormer England defender Stephen Warnock believes PSG's tie with Villa is \"massively\" in the French side's favour.\n\"In the first leg PSG were hoping to draw them out of defence and almost give them false hope by leaving spaces for them to attack into,\" Warnock told BBC Sport.\n\"Villa are going to have the same problem in the second leg too, especially with the score at 3-1.\n\"Now they will have to go at them, which opens up the game for PSG on the break.

He is really down to earth and also sympathetic off the pitch. But on the pitch he is a leader, smart and aggressive in a good way.\"\nAfter Salah scored in the 2013 Europa League quarter-final win against Tottenham, Yakin said: \"If Mohamed could score as well, he would not be here any more.\"\nAnd when he did start scoring, Yakin was proved right.\nHe left for Chelsea, where he only played 530 minutes in the league, before loan spells at Fiorentina and Roma, signing permanently for the latter prior to going to Liverpool.\nThe Football News Show.

If that was the ploy it did not work immediately - but the desired outcome has now been achieved.\nThe Kop had already delivered its verdict with the banner based on his trademark goal celebration containing the message: \"He Fires A Bow. Now give Mo His Dough.\"\nNow that wish, as well as Salah's, has been fulfilled.\nSaudi Arabia would have been fertile ground for Salah financially, but it could not offer the enticement of the biggest honours in the game, something he can still pursue at Liverpool.\nSalah's relationship with former manager Klopp looked strained towards the end of last season, including a very public spat at West Ham United when Liverpool conceded a goal as he waited to come on as substitute in a 2-2 draw.\nHe did not break stride as he walked past reporters but his words \"if I speak there will be fire\" did nothing to disguise tensions.\nThis season, despite a recent dip from his stellar standards, Salah has thrived under Slot. He has, at times, almost looked like a man on a personal mission to re-establish Liverpool as the dominant force in domestic football.\nThis video can not be played\n'He's an icon' - Liverpool fans react to Salah's new contract\nLiverpool, cashing in on Manchester City's collapse and a faltering Arsenal, have established superiority in the Premier League, although the loss to Paris St-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League was a disappointment after finishing top of the new league league table format to reach the knockout phase.\nWhen Liverpool hit the top of the Premier League table with victory over Brighton at Anfield on 2 November, Salah reacted on X with: \"Top of the table is where this club belongs. Nothing less.\"\nAnd that is where Liverpool have stayed, with Salah the main inspiration.\nLiverpool's form under the calm, methodical Dutchman Slot, plus the fact they show every sign of hunting down those major honours Salah craves now and in the future, will all have played into the Egyptian's thinking.\nHe will surely secure a second Premier League title, but Salah will also believe he should have more than one Champions League after mixed fortunes in the competition.\nHe had the fateful injury against Real Madrid in Kyiv in the 2018 final and then suffered anguish against the same opponents in the final in Paris four years later in what became a personal duel with keeper Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian produced six saves from Salah alone as Real again broke Liverpool hearts with a 1-0 win.\nFinancial considerations, of course, will have played their part, but the prospect of leading a rebuilt, rejuvenated Liverpool into a new era under Slot will also have appealed.\nSalah on a mission is a dangerous prospect. He now has the opportunity to add to his trophy haul of one Champions League, one Premier League, one FA Cup, two League Cups, the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup at Anfield.\nIt means that for Salah and Liverpool, the perfect sporting marriage goes on.\nThis video can not be played\n'Salah has the mentality to play until he's 40'\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Since joining Manchester United in summer 2023, Andre Onana has made more mistakes in all competitions than any other Premier League goalkeeper\nWar of the words, power of the press conference. In what felt like a trade of verbal blows from a bygone era, Lyon midfielder Nemanja Matic's jibe that Andre Onana is \"one of the worst goalkeepers\" in Manchester United history set the tone for Thursday's Europa League meeting.\nOnana was then at fault for both Lyon's goals in his side's 2-2 draw in the quarter-final first leg - just a day after those comments from former Red Devils player Matic.\nIt means that since the start of last season, Onana has made eight errors leading to goals in all competitions, the most of any keeper playing for a Premier League club.\nBoss Ruben Amorim looked to take the spotlight off his goalkeeper by suggesting he is the one who has made more mistakes than his players this season. \nBut there is no avoiding the questions - did Matic's comments affect Onana's performance on Thursday night? Was playing mind games his intention all along? And how does Onana rebuild his confidence before facing Lyon again next week?\n\"If you get another high-profile player who comes out with a comment like that, despite how much shielding they do, he is going to know it,\" says chartered psychologist Dr Simon Moore.\n\"They're all on social media, they have all got phones and he is not going to be able to avoid it. It will get in his head, because no matter how hard he tries to park it and move on, it will bug him.\n\"The other thing is, you get this reaction of 'well I am going to go out and show everybody that I don't make mistakes and I am over it'. And that puts even more pressure and duress on you to achieve that.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'One of the worst keepers in Man Utd history' - Matic on Onana\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, Matic was asked about Onana's comments from earlier this week that United were \"way better\" than French club Lyon.\nSerbian Matic, who played for United from 2017-2022, responded: \"You know, I respect everyone but to say that then you need to give the answer.\n\"If you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's history, you need to take care what you're talking about.\n\"If it was [Edwin] Van der Sar, [Peter] Schmeichel or [David] De Gea saying that, then I would question myself. But you need to have cover to say something like that.\"\nOnana then posted on social media to deny he was being disrespectful.\n\"I would never be disrespectful to another club. We know that tomorrow will be a difficult game against a strong opponent,\" Onana said on X.\n\"We focus on preparing a performance to make our fans proud.\n\"At least I've lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can't say the same.\"\nThis video can not be played\nOnana given vote of confidence by Amorim after errors\n\"He was in the headlines before the game and now he is going to be all over the headlines again,\" said former England winger Aaron Lennon on BBC Radio 5 Live following Onana's errors against Lyon. \n\"I think he looks a bit silly tonight and Matic is probably the one who is going to sleep well,\" added former Lyon and England midfielder Izzy Christiansen.\nMoore, who co-hosts the What's Your Goal podcast alongside former England midfielder Katie Chapman, says the brain is wired to pay specific attention to risk, threat and mistakes from an \"ego, status and reputation point of view\".\n\"Given the fact he is a goalkeeper at a very famous club and there is a lot of pressure on shoulders anyway within that team, they have had a lot of negative media throughout the year, he is going to have a double whammy effect,\" Moore says.\n\"What you are doing is signalling to your brain, rather than 'how can I do well?', is 'how can I avoid a mistake?'.\"\nMatt Shaw is a chartered sports psychologist at InnerDrive, who work with players from senior internationals to academy level.\n\"We often talk about external noise and trying to limit it as much as possible,\" says Shaw. \"In some sense, it could be a coincidence those comments were made and then he had a poor performance.\n\"You might look at other times this season where no comments were made and he had good or bad performances after that as well.\"\nShaw says what is being said off the pitch can often be \"overhyped\" because of its importance to fans and the media, rather than the players themselves.\n\"A lot of these guys, it is water off a duck's back,\" he explains. \"When it does impact players it's really interesting, because we often forget they are experts in what they do - experts can have poor performance - but also in terms of how they handle those situations.\n\"You see Onana pre-match going straight up to the fans in front of the net, where it looked like it didn't really affect him at all. It can affect these guys, but often it doesn't.\n\"When we are working with players, we are working with them all the time and trying to keep them at a baseline. It is easy to draw a straight line and say lots of stuff happened pre-match and he went on to make mistakes that led to goals. Whereas the chances are, once the game starts, it is very unlikely that is in his mind because he has way more to focus on.\n\"What we always want is players thinking in a helpful way, what do they need to think about and focus in order to perform well? Obviously comments beforehand about being United's poorest goalkeeper aren't the comments we want him thinking about. But I would be surprised if those were in his mind.\"\n'I've made more mistakes than them' - Amorim defends Onana after errors\nHow does Onana compare to other Man Utd keepers after Matic criticism?\nSo what can Onana, and United's backroom staff, do to help focus him going forward?\n\"I would remind him of all the positive things he's been doing, bombard him with all the clips,\" says Moore. \"He's a great stopper, his reflexes are amazing, so remind him.\n\"That will give him confidence, and then maybe play the clips back and say these are areas we need to work on.\n\"Football is a creative sport, that is great for the fan because you get lots of exciting moments, but creativity also means you are going to fail a lot - that is the nature of creativity. He has got to accept he is an industry that oscillates between 'wow' moments and moments you make mistakes.\"\nShaw says, after a debrief, it is about focusing on the action plan going forwards.\n\"And then it's about going into training and practising those things or stripping it all the way back to 'OK, what am I good at? What is the part of the game that makes me who I am as a goalkeeper?' and just focusing on those things instead,\" he adds.\nThe one-week turnaround before facing Lyon in the second leg may seem tight, but Shaw says in football terms that is plenty of time to move on - and Manchester United have another game, at Newcastle on Sunday, to think about first anyway.\n\"The goalkeeper team will be quite tight,\" he adds.\n\"They will be getting around him and then really going back to what they enjoy doing in training and just trying to make sure he is successful in training so it builds some confidence over the course of the week, as well as having those conversations about what we do differently next time.\n\"In any of our walks of life, if something goes wrong, we expect people to get around us, having a little bit of a debrief with a focus on being better next time as opposed to not being good enough - then really just focusing on the things that make him a good goalkeeper and trying to expose those throughout the week.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

Some can't say the same,\" said Onana.\nThe 29-year-old has played 93 matches since his \u00a343.8m move from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023.\nIn all club competitions, he has conceded 137 goals and kept 23 clean sheets, conceding an average of 1.47 goals per game.\nNine of those 23 clean sheets have come in the Premier League this season, the fourth highest in the league, despite United sitting 13th in the Premier League table.\nSince the start of 2023-24, only Jordan Pickford (8.7) has prevented more goals based on Opta's expected goals model in the Premier League than Manchester United's Andre Onana (7.5).\nSince moving to the Premier League, Onana has ranked second on Opta's goals prevented metric, only behind Jordan Pickford in the Premier League over the past two campaigns.\nOpta calculate that Onana has actually conceded 7.5 goals fewer than expected from the quality of shots faced; with Pickford on 8.7.\nHowever, Onana has made high profile errors, especially in last season's awful Champions League group stage exit.\nAnd in the Premier League since 2023-24, only three goalkeepers have made more errors leading to goals than Onana has (4) - Arijanet Muric with seven and Robert Sanchez and Bart Verbruggen, both with six.\nSince the 2003-04 season, Onana tops the charts for the amount of saves made per game. Onana makes 3.4 saves per 90 minutes. In comparison, De Gea made 2.8 saves per 90 minutes and Van der Sar 2.5. \nOnana does not rank as well for save percentage. Andres Lindegaard is the only goalkeeper with a lower save percentage. De Gea, Van der Sar, Tim Howard, Dean Henderson, Ben Foster, Roy Carroll and Tomasz Kuszack all rank higher.\nIn the Premier League, Onana has the lowest number of minutes per goal conceded of all Manchester United goalkeepers - conceding every 63 minutes, on average. \nLindegaard was next on the list, every 81 minutes; De Gea every 84 minutes, Peter Schmeichel every 106 minutes, Van der Sar every 117 minutes and top of the list was Carroll, who conceded every 152 minutes.\nHe is playing in a Manchester United team in the bottom half of the Premier League table. The lowest the club has ever finished is eighth, in Onana's first season.\nRed Devils head coach Ruben Amorim described the team as \"maybe the worst\" in the club's 147-year history in January.\nOnly Raimond van der Gouw ranks lower than Onana for clean sheet percentage in the Premier League for United. Ben Foster has the highest percentage at 50% - but from just 12 appearances. \nVan der Sar, Schmeichel and De Gea - the only three goalkeepers with over 100 Premier League appearances - had clean sheet percentages of 48.4%, 44.4% and 35.4%, respectively.\nHow much are Premier League referees paid?\nHow does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?\nWho decides the Match of the Day running order?\nWhy do different football competitions have different balls?\nDo you have questions for the Ask Me Anything team?

        "article_text": "From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.\nWhile much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.\nThis is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't find Rome or London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finally found its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's caused tourism upheaval \u2013 and rows with locals \u2013 in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.\nThese are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.\nPuglia saw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays \u2013 still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.\n\"The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authentic masserie\u00a0(farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,\" says California-based travel advisor and photographer Coco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. \"The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites like Alberobello make it exceptional,\" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience the Jubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events in Rome.\nTran recommends booking a table at cliff-side Osteria Sant'Anna in Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter through Lecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran says Masseria Torre Coccaro remains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves \u2013 plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.\u00a0\nBest time to visit: Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.\nPortugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation than Porto and Lisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is the Alentejo coast, which experienced its best tourism year on record in 2024.\n\"Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,\" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey \u2013 especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.\nWho picked the list?\nStacey Leasca is an award-winning travel journalist living in Lisbon, Portugal, with two decades of experience covering destinations across Europe and beyond. She served as adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Southern California and is a PhD candidate specialising in building resiliency to disinformation in journalism.\u00a0\nThe area's \"mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe\" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price of\u00a0ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.\n\u00c9vora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famed\u00a0Festas dos Santos Populares\u00a0(Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself at\u00a0Craveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm \u2013 including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.\nBest time to visit:\u00a0Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through the\u00a0Fisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.\u00a0\nAbout five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier \u2013 both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks \u2013 specifically, Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (\u00a389.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.\nHowever, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride the Glacier Express train through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel \u2013 including a seemingly endless supply of fondue \u2013 and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxurious Chedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for the Post Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.\nBest time to visit: Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.\nCap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the C\u00f4ted'Azur \u2013 an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy \u2013 and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.\nThe iconic Belles Rives hotel \u2013 Fitzgerald's home for part of the 1920s \u2013 is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. \"The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,\" says Andria Mitsakos, founder of AMPR, which represents the property.\nBeyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts the Juan-les-Pins International Jazz Festival in July, when Bastille Day celebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend the Festival International d'Art Sacr\u00e9, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as the Picasso Museum and the Chapelle Matisse.\nBest time to visit: The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.\nWhile Italy continues to grapple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery, cultural depth and fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named a European Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.\nAt just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a \"small but mighty country\", says James Montie, branch manager at Fox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, \"from Lake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave\", are a primary draw, he adds.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n\u2022 Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n\u2022 Here's how to safely visit glacier sites around the world\nIndependent travel advisor Kimberly Denison agrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds \"Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,\" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that 60% of the country's surface area is forest and it was certified as the world's first green destination in 2016.\nTo explore its glorious landscapes, hike Triglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting at Vila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.\nBest time to visit: The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.\nThe Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine \u2013 specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.\nOf the Peloponnese's three peninsulas, Mani \u2013 the rugged middle finger \u2013 stands out. \"Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani is Greece's best-kept secret,\" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. \"This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance.\" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with \"a deep-rooted history\", she adds. Stay at Pirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century tower\u00a0turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.\nElsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.\nBest time to visit: Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.\nParis had quite the 2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever; since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for the banlieues (suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.\nWhat parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel at Goway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. \"Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,\" he explains, \"but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture \u2013 there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too.\" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks to Notre Dame reopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classic H\u00f4tel du Savoir, formerly called the H\u00f4tel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and is, let's just say, tr\u00e9s chic.\nBest time to visit: Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.\nTourism to Sweden has surged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the \"coolcation\" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.\nWhile many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think granite islands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light \u2013 minus the crowds and queues of the capital.\nIt's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, with Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded the EU's Mission Label for its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in at Hotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, the Bohusl\u00e4n archipelago beckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.\nBest time to visit: June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.\nAlbania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record 11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest in lesser-known Mediterranean escapes \u2013 which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.\n\"Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,\" says Denison. \"The Unesco-listed town of Gjirokast\u00ebr, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.\"\nNew infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including the Green Coast Hotel near the Unesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. \"Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,\" Denison adds.\nWhile hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, the Accursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays like La Brisa Boutique Hotel in Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the new Marriott in the Vlora Marina (expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.\nBest time to visit: The summer months are prime time in Albania \u2013 and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.\nWant to explore even further?

        "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.\nBut now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.\nThe White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \n\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.\nThat framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. \nSo was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?\nIt didn't take long for Trump's aides \u2013 many of the same people who said he would never back down \u2013 to fan out and celebrate the president's move.\nTrade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\".\n\"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\"\nThey were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?\nUltimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.\nEarlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. \nIn the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.\nHe insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".\n\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.\nIn the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. \nThe reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. \nIt is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.\nThat will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions.\nThe big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week \u2013 setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order \u2013 will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. \nAnd in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

It's as simple as that.\"\nMasters tee-times for round three at Augusta National\nThe Masters 2025 round two recap\n'I needed to pee' - Masters debutant takes relief in Rae's Creek\nRose has put together a stellar career, in which he has secured 25 professional wins, topped the world rankings, won Olympic gold and spearheaded Ryder Cup success - but fallen agonisingly short at Augusta on several occasions.\nWithout a tournament victory since February 2023, and a catalogue of missed cuts since, few would have backed Rose to be in such a strong position at the halfway stage.\nFinding consistency throughout recent seasons has been difficult. \nBut, as he did when coming through qualifying to finish second at last year's Open Championship, and in finishing joint sixth at last year's US PGA Championship, Rose has demonstrated again at Augusta National that he retains the hunger and heart to challenge for the biggest prizes.\nIt is a testament to his quality, experience and nous around one of golf's most testing courses that he goes into the weekend with a fighting chance of victory.\n\"I think my game is good. I feel like I'm showing much more quality this year in my game than I have done the past couple years,\" said Rose.\nRose was the overnight leader after a majestic opening 65 during which he threatened to challenge the course record of 63.\nFailing to back up strong starts at the iconic venue has been a common theme for the former world number one, however.\nRose's putter was red hot on the opening day, leading the strokes gained on the green category by a substantial margin and enabling him to open up a three-shot lead.\nFrom tee to green he was always not as precise, however, and that continued on Friday as his short game helped keep him ahead of the chasing pack.\n\"It was a decent day. My wedge kept me in a good spot,\" he added.\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy stuns Augusta with superb eagle on 13th\nBefore this week's tournament, McIlroy discussed his pride at showing \"resilience from setbacks\" in his career.\nThis was another example of his ability to bounce back, having spoiled what had been a serene opening round with a pair of late double bogeys on Thursday.\nThe mistakes on the 15th and 17th holes - which left him seven shots adrift of Rose - felt like a terminal blow to his chances of finally landing the Green Jacket.\nOnly two men in history have come from that far behind after 18 holes to win - Nick Faldo in 1990 and Tiger Woods in 2005.\nThen again, this is McIlroy. A player who rarely does anything conventionally and is a magnet for drama.\nLike he has done several times in the past at Augusta, he showed indomitable spirit to play himself back into contention on Friday.\n\"I had to keep reminding myself that I played really well [in round one] and I wasn't going to let two bad holes dictate the rest of the tournament for me,\" McIlroy told BBC Sport NI.\n\"I had a chat with [sports psychologist] Bob Rotella and we talked about patience, letting the score come to you.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'Discipline and patience' - Watch McIlroy on his second round 66 at the Masters\nMcIlroy made a fast start with a birdie on the par-five second, despite needing to chip out from behind a tree with his second shot.\nWhile he was unable to make any further headway on the first nine, the four-time major champion reignited his challenge after the turn.\nBack-to-back birdies on 10 and 11 encouraged McIlroy before a stunning eagle on the par-five 13th - having knocked a risk-reward long iron out of the pine straw on to the green - accelerated his recovery.\nMore creative craft saw him to recover from another wayward drive on 14, hitting another iron out of the pine straw and through hooded branches to escape with a par.\nRedemption came at 15 in the form of another birdie before he safely negotiated the final three holes without dropping a shot.\nThis year, unlike others, his revival is not too late.\n\"I've done too many times round here where I've tried to chase too early and shot myself in the foot,\" added McIlroy.\n\"So it was a really good display of discipline and patience and I feel like that was rewarded.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'That's something else!' - Scheffler chips in after finding bushes\nAfter opening with a bogey-free 68, world number one Scheffler looked primed to further build on a solid start in his usual unflappable manner.\nInitially that was the case as the 28-year-old American, playing among the later starters in a blustery wind, marshalled the more difficult conditions with a two-under 34 on the first nine.\nThen, he became uncharacteristically erratic after the turn.\nThree birdies - including a fortunate two on the 12th after his tee shot bounced back into play off the bushes behind the green - were outweighed by four bogeys.\n\"It was challenging on the back nine, so I took advantage of my opportunities, and hopefully I'll clean up the card a little bit on Saturday,\" said the two-time champion, who also won in 2022.\nLIV Series player Hatton, still searching for his first major victory, knocked in six birdies on a course which he has infamously had a fiery relationship with.\nHowever, they were tempered by four bogeys - including on the 17th where he lipped out an 18-inch par putt.\n\"Tapping in there and hitting a little mark - all of a sudden you look stupid,\" said the 33-year-old Englishman.\n\"When you hit a decent putt from a foot, you expect it to go in.\"\nLanger received a standing ovation from the patrons and a warm embrace from Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley as he left the 18th green\nTwo-time champion Bernhard Langer's Masters farewell did not have a dream ending as he fell agonisingly short of the cut on his 41st and final appearance.\nThe 67-year-old German, who won in 1985 and 1993, grimaced as a par putt on the 18th slipped past the hole and left him unclear whether he had done enough to make the weekend.\nBut his three-over total of 147 left him on the wrong side of the cut line - which was two over par.\n\"Coming up 18 was mixed emotions because I was still inside the cut line, and even when I made bogey, I wasn't sure I'm totally out of there or not,\" Langer said.\nLanger, who has decided to stop playing because he thinks the course is \"too long\" for him now, received an emotional standing ovation when he walked off for what proved to be the final time.\n\"I have so many wonderful memories of playing this golf course,\" he said.\n\"I fell in love with it immediately when I played my first round here, and was fortunate to win twice, and come back here for many, many years.

        "article_text": "I've known Charlotte Edwards since I was 11 years old.\nI was a wide-eyed young cricketer at England development trials and Lot - or Lottie, as many know her - was the 16-year-old prodigy already playing for England.\nHaving captained her country, she now takes over as head coach at a pivotal time.\nWhile she will need buy-in from all the players and a vision for success, a 16-0 Ashes defeat in Australia should be enough motivation and I'm sure this will be a turning point.\nIt has to be.\nEngland to be 'accountable' for fitness - Edwards\n'Everyone should be excited by this' - England appoint Edwards as head coach\nFollowing the departure of Jon Lewis, Lot will want to assert control but she is also well-versed in the importance of not panicking and empowering the players.\nThe last thing she wants is to rein it in too much and England lose the ability to play with freedom.\nBalance is key, and while courage and having no fear of failure is important, England's biggest problem in the Ashes was a lack of ruthlessness and discipline at key moments.\nThere is enough to work with, though. Yes, Australia are fitter and have more depth but, despite the scoreline, most England players have improved in skill, which is what Lot sees too.\nOne of her first tasks is to appoint a captain.\nLot has a relationship with Nat Sciver-Brunt from their time as England team-mates and recently at Mumbai Indians. Sciver-Brunt is England vice-captain and has said she wants the job.\nThe risk is whether England are asking too much of their best player, who has recently become a mother.\nPat Cummins faced a similar dilemma when he became Australia captain before an Ashes, shortly after the birth of his first child. \nIt's fair to say he's managed it effectively but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right thing to do for Nat. It will be a careful consideration in the coming weeks.\nKnight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIsa Guha played three Tests, 19 T20s and 59 ODIs under Charlotte Edwards' captaincy\nLot always seemed to have so much time at the crease as a batter, as if her mind was a crystal ball predicting what was coming.\nShe had a mesmerising aura and was the one batter I regularly struggled to execute a plan to of how to dismiss.\nAs her team-mate, I saw her do it to every international bowling attack.\nScoring runs came naturally but, after Lot took on the captaincy for the first time in 2005 when Clare Connor was injured, she faced a real test of her leadership - not winning a single game on a tour in India.\nThat didn't deter her, though. She had a vision to overtake Australia and make us the best team in the world.\nThe foundations were there. We had just won an Ashes for the first time in 42 years, so there was real belief in the group.\nLot led by example, but there was also an authority that could be quite intimidating.\nShe wore her heart on her sleeve and, as the best player, it would hurt immensely if we let her down. Over time, she learned to become more approachable and empathetic and that's what I see in her now as a coach.\nIn winning both the T20 and 50-over World Cups in 2009, along with the Ashes, we became the most successful England side in history.\nAt times, it was Lot's ability to make tough calls to protect the team that led to this success.\nShe won't be afraid of making difficult calls here if anything doesn't align with the vision.\nWe struggled to maintain that consistency over the next cycle, but when new players came through, the youth revived her ambition. The captaincy and success continued.\nThis video can not be played\nCharlotte Edwards discusses England's future as she becomes head coach\nHowever, her presence as a leader eventually became a block for others to bloom, which worked against her in the end.\nAfter being told England would move on from her as captain and a player in 2016, I felt for her. There was a brutality to it because she was still playing well.\nWhile fitness became a talking point, ultimately the coach wanted a team that didn't rely on her leadership.\nEight years on and Heather Knight has found herself in the same unfortunate position around the captaincy. There is no other option but for others to step up.\nNo doubt that period came with a lot of soul-searching for Lot, but resilient people always find a way.\nShe tried different things but coaching just made sense, her passion for cricket never dimming. She understood a need to learn from the past, upgrade and adapt.\nWith success at Hampshire, Southern Brave, Sydney Sixers and Mumbai Indians, working in different environments with players of different standards, it's obvious they respond well to her.\nDuring this year's Women's Premier League, where she led Mumbai to the title, I was fortunate to watch her at close quarters.\nWith vastly different cricketing backgrounds and languages, she found ways to articulate her message to each player, showing patience and a desire to get to know them all.\nThere was pressure to win but her first priority was always to protect and nurture, especially the less experienced players, so they could deliver with a calm head.\nWith another major trophy to her name, there is no doubt she is ready to lead England.",

        "summary": "'Edwards era will be a turning point for England'Image source, BBC SportPublished10 April 2025I've known Charlotte Edwards since I was 11 years old.I was a wide-eyed young cricketer at England development trials and Lot - or Lottie, as many know her - was the 16-year-old prodigy already playing for England.Having captained her country, she now takes over as head coach at a pivotal time.While she will need buy-in from all the players and a vision for success, a 16-0 Ashes defeat in Australia should be enough motivation and I'm sure this will be a turning point.It has to be.England to be 'accountable' for fitness - EdwardsPublished2 April'Everyone should be excited by this' - England appoint Edwards as head coachPublished1 AprilFollowing the departure of Jon Lewis, Lot will want to assert control but she is also well-versed in the importance of not panicking and empowering the players.The last thing she wants is to rein it in too much and England lose the ability to play with freedom.Balance is key, and while courage and having no fear of failure is important, England's biggest problem in the Ashes was a lack of ruthlessness and discipline at key moments.There is enough to work with, though. Yes, Australia are fitter and have more depth but, despite the scoreline, most England players have improved in skill, which is what Lot sees too.One of her first tasks is to appoint a captain.Lot has a relationship with Nat Sciver-Brunt from their time as England team-mates and recently at Mumbai Indians. Sciver-Brunt is England vice-captain and has said she wants the job.The risk is whether England are asking too much of their best player, who has recently become a mother.Pat Cummins faced a similar dilemma when he became Australia captain before an Ashes, shortly after the birth of his first child. Over time, she learned to become more approachable and empathetic and that's what I see in her now as a coach.In winning both the T20 and 50-over World Cups in 2009, along with the Ashes, we became the most successful England side in history.At times, it was Lot's ability to make tough calls to protect the team that led to this success.She won't be afraid of making difficult calls here if anything doesn't align with the vision.We struggled to maintain that consistency over the next cycle, but when new players came through, the youth revived her ambition. It will be a careful consideration in the coming weeks.Knight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?Published22 MarchWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?Published21 March'A mesmerising aura'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Isa Guha played three Tests, 19 T20s and 59 ODIs under Charlotte Edwards' captaincyLot always seemed to have so much time at the crease as a batter, as if her mind was a crystal ball predicting what was coming.She had a mesmerising aura and was the one batter I regularly struggled to execute a plan to of how to dismiss.As her team-mate, I saw her do it to every international bowling attack.Scoring runs came naturally but, after Lot took on the captaincy for the first time in 2005 when Clare Connor was injured, she faced a real test of her leadership - not winning a single game on a tour in India.That didn't deter her, though.",

        "article_text": "Jonathan Haidt's book, The Anxious Generation, sparked a global reckoning about mobile phone usage among children when it came out last year. So, I checked in with him to find out if he still thinks childhood is at risk from too much screen time.\nParents need help. I know from experience. It's really hard to get kids off their screens when all their friends are stuck on theirs. This addiction demands collective action.\nIn the days since I spoke with Haidt, there's been one thing that he said that I haven't been able to get off my mind.\u00a0\n\"I have not met one member of Gen Z who's in denial, who says, 'No, we love the phones, the phones are good for us,'\" Haidt told me. \"They all see what's happening, but they feel trapped.\"\u00a0\nSo, has anything actually changed in the year since Haidt's book? Was all the hype around mobile phones just a flash-in-the-pan moment of collective parental anxiety or did it produce the kind of action many parents are longing for?\nWatch our full conversation, here:\nBelow is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nKatty Kay: It's been a year since your book came out and caused a huge conversation. I wanted to start by getting a kind of report card of where we are on the various aspects of what you're trying to do: phones in school, age gating, social media, getting kids to have more free playtime. Who's doing well and who isn't in America on all of those issues?\u00a0\nJonathan Haidt: I knew that the book was going to be popular. What I wasn't prepared for is that this issue would spread like wildfire around the world, not just in the US. Because around the world, family life has turned into a fight over screen time. Everyone hates it. Everyone sees it.\nWhere it took off most quickly was phone-free schools, because that is something that is very easily done. It's so hard to teach to a classroom when half of them are watching short videos and playing video games. So, the teachers have hated the phones from the beginning but they were afraid, especially in America \u2013 maybe it's the same in the UK \u2013 but in America, there are a lot of parents who want to be able to communicate all the time with their child, and they think they have a right to check in on their child. And, 'What if something goes wrong? I need to be there.' So, the overparenting \u2014\nKK: That's a paradox, then, because you've got the parents who are super worried about the phones; they see what phones are doing to their kids. But they also don't want their kids to relinquish their phones when they go into school.\nJH: Hey, look, people are complicated! They contain multitudes. And I shouldn't say that everyone saw the problem, because there were a lot of parents who saw the phone as a lifeline. They see the world as very threatening and dangerous. And so, early on in this process, I thought there would be this uniquely American thing about overprotection, because we do have a lot more crime than you do in Europe or Canada.\u00a0\nBut the surprising thing, to me, as I've been studying this for a while now, is that the vast overprotection swept through all of the English-speaking countries in the '90s. So, all the English-speaking countries went through this at the same time. And now, all of them are taking action really quickly. UK and Australia, I'd say, are in the lead in terms of actually passing legislation.\nKK: Here in the United States, we've seen some battles go through Congress, but this has not happened at a national level. What I am seeing is individual states enact laws to stop kids having phones in school.\u00a0\nJH: That's right, because we don't have a functioning legislature in the United States. We have Congress. And Congress can't really do anything if anybody objects. So, from the beginning, I have not assumed we're going to get a damn bit of help from Congress. I've been focusing on the 50 US states and on the UK, Australia and the EU. If we get legislative change in those domains, we win.\nKK: Is it too early to see what the impact is in schools that ban phones? Do we have any data on that yet or is this just a supposition that they're going to do better?\u00a0\nJH: We have reports from schools that go phone-free. And I challenge people to look around for a school that went truly phone-free, not just during class time. If it's just a restriction during class time, that's not phone-free. That causes all kinds of problems. All the kids are on their phones in between classes. But truly phone-free, where you turn in phones in the morning and you get back in the evening, the reports are raves.\u00a0\nThe most common things they say are that discipline problems are down. There's just a lot less fighting, a lot less drama. Truancy is down. School is a lot more fun when you can actually talk with your friends and play with them and laugh with them. So, truancy goes down, tardiness goes down, kids arrive on time. And the most thrilling thing for me, and the most universal thing they say is we hear laughter in the hallways again. So, the reports are uniformly raves. There's often some resistance in the first week or two, but what they mostly say is \u2014\nKK: Who's the resistance from?\u00a0\nJH: Some of the kids don't like it and some of the parents don't like it. But I've spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school superintendents. What they're telling me is they expected a huge pushback from parents, but they actually didn't get it. Because this year is different. The zeitgeist has changed.\nActually, it started in the UK even before my book came out. You had smartphone-free schools; they went viral in February of last year and my book didn't come out until March. So, it's a different environment now, and schools are ready to act. Now, there are some studies, there are some academic studies that have been equivocal, but when you look at them \u2013 there was one that came out in the UK, it was published in the Lancet.\nIt said phone-free schools don't help. No, it didn't. It looked at like eight schools that had a backpack policy, which is not very good, and then like 11 or 15 schools that had a classroom-ban policy. It was like there was a slight difference in policies. These are very different schools. So, we have a Substack post showing this Lancet study doesn't show anything of the sort. There was a study in the UK done by Policy Exchange, where they looked at several hundred UK schools, and only about 10% are truly phone-free. If you look at the schools in the UK that are truly phone-free, and you compare them to the others, then you do find academic benefits and behavioural benefits.\nKK: I want to go back to something you said at the beginning about the 1990s and how that became a time of fear. I've been a working mother my whole life. I have four children: two of whom were born in the 90s, one was born in 2000, one was born in 2006. So, they've all had different experiences with screens. But from the research that I've done, something else happened in the kind of 80s and 90s, which was a sort of expansion of what we deem to be a good parent, and more specifically than that, a good mother, right? So, women were taking on full-time jobs and still doing the overwhelming share of household chores.\nBut it's not just that. In my research, women today are doing as much in the way of household chores as their great-grandmothers were in the early part of the 1900s. It's that society somehow deemed us not to be good parents if we weren't spending an enormous amount of time with our kids, spending our weekends running ragged taking them to events. And somehow you got, particularly perhaps if you were a working mother, the kind of guilt exploded. I feel like screens \u2013 and I've seen it with my own kids \u2013 screens just became a kind of form of relief for parents, and mothers in particular, from whom society was just asking impossible things.\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0Every word you said is true. I'll just try to add on to it. It is a puzzle. And I've got a really bizarre graph in the book showing that the amount of time that mothers and fathers spent parenting was fairly flat in the 80s and even into the 90s. And then all of a sudden in the mid 1990s, at least in the US, it jumped up. Something changed in the 90s. And it's the norm that you're talking about.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Great, I moved here in '96, so I just hit right at the right moment! [Laughter]\nJH:\u00a0You just hit it! That's right. So, that really did happen. Women today have fewer children than their grandmothers did, and they're working outside the home, which their grandmothers didn't, and they're spending more time with the kids. So, a lot of this has fallen on women.\u00a0\nNow, why did this happen? The best answer comes from this really wonderful book called Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi. He's a British sociologist and he's focusing on what happened in the UK, not the US, although he points out that the same things happened in the US and Canada. And what happened, he says, is we lost trust in other people. And when that happens, then we don't trust our neighbourhood. We don't trust people to send our kids out.\u00a0\nIt's always been the case that raising kids was kind of a joint project. When you lose that, now every family is on their own. And that means it's mostly the mothers who are on their own.\nKK:\u00a0In your sort of meta analysis of screens and kids and schools, and whether we can have phones in schools, is it actually the case that we have to address those issues before we can really wean our kids off this screen addiction?\nJH:\u00a0We have to understand those issues first if we want to fully understand what happened historically. But I would not say that we have to address those issues first, because, frankly, we're not going to address them. I mean reversing the decline of community, you know, I go to all kinds of meetings about that. There are all kinds of foundations. But look, technology changes society \u2014\nKK:\u00a0Can you just fix it all, Jon? [Laughter] I mean, I know you've done phones in schools, but really, step it up!\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0[Laughter] Yeah. Let's fix community next! So, no, we're not going to restore trust in our neighbours such that we can let our kids out. That's not going to happen. In fact, it's likely to get a lot worse as we go into the\u00a0era of AI, when we have no idea what's true. We're never going to know what's true again for a very long time, if ever. So, rather, we have to adapt to this. And I think the way we adapt to this onslaught of technology is by saying, \"Okay, you know what? Kids are not adults.\"\nWe have to focus on what it will take to allow kids to have healthy brain development through puberty. That's my mission. We've got to give kids a lot less screen time. A lot less fragmenting time. No TikTok. No short videos. That's the worst, and give them a lot more experience interacting with people.\nKK:\u00a0What do you say to poorer families where both parents have to work multiple jobs and for whom the invention of screen content that occupies their small children is just literally a lifesaver for them? Is there a different argument there or not?\nJH:\u00a0Yes, there is. So, the way to understand this is that in the 90s, when we were all techno-optimists, the internet was amazing. The early internet was amazing. And rich kids had computers and internet access and poor kids didn't. And so in the 1990s, we had a big thing, you know, it was educational equity.\u00a0Bill Gates, all kinds of philanthropists donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Let's get every kid a computer.\nSo, in the early 2000s, we're all techno-optimists and we think, 'Well, okay, I don't trust my kid to walk three blocks to a store, but he's on a computer. What could happen? He's learning! That's great!' We think it's good that our kids are upstairs on a computer. And, of course, this is one of the central ideas in the\u00a0Netflix show Adolescence\u00a0is, you know, parents think their kids are safe when they're on a computer. And in the 90s, they mostly were. There was some bad stuff, too, but they mostly were.\u00a0\nBut once the internet gets taken over, or at least once childhood gets\u00a0owned by three or four big companies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0TikTok, Snap, Meta and Google \u2013 once childhood is owned by these companies that are using algorithms to send them content, to keep them hooked, this is when things get much darker. Kids on computers now, they're not learning to program. They're not learning any useful skills. They're just basically lying there consuming content. And this is when it gets really sick and really dark.\nEditorial Note:\nTikTok told the BBC's Marianna Spring it has \"industry-leading\" safety settings for teens, and Meta cites its own tools for \"positive and age-appropriate experiences\". Read more about how social media companies address concerns of children's safety online, here.\nBut we don't quite realise that. And so what's happened now is the educational equity issue has reversed. It used to be \"get poor kids computers\". But by the 2000s, what was clear was that the rich people, and especially the people in Silicon Valley, don't let their kids have this stuff. So, now the great educational equity imperative is we've got to give the poor kids the same protections that the rich kids have. We've got to get them less time on screens. You said it's literally a lifesaver. I would say no, it's not literally a lifesaver. It literally is a brain-scrambler.\nKK: A lot of what you write about and the way you write is targeted at adults. If you were to go into schools and talk to middle school children, what would be the most effective argument you could make to them?\nJH: I'm glad you asked that, because just before our conversation, I was in an hour-long conversation with my team. We're creating a version of The Anxious Generation for 8-to-12 year olds, for kids who don't yet have a smartphone. And the main thing that we want to convey to them is that there are these companies that are going to try to hook you. And they've hooked most kids. If you look at the kids older than you, they're not having fun. They're lonely, they're sad. Because they all got sucked into just being content consumers, that's all they do. But do you want to have an amazing, exciting life? Do you want to do things? Do you want to have fun with your friends?\nDon't go down that route. Don't let these companies trick you and suck you in. One of the key ideas in The Anxious Generation is this is not a book about screens; this is a book about childhood. What kind of childhood do we want for our kids?\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston and recent Bafta nominee Marianne Jean-Baptiste are set to star in a new stage production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons.\nThe pair will be joined by I May Destroy You star Paapa Essiedu in the production, which will open in London's West End in November.\nFirst performed in 1947, All My Sons established Miller as a major voice in US theatre and is one of his most enduring plays.\nSpeaking to BBC News, Jean-Baptiste said she hoped the new production would \"tell a new story, of an old story\".\nAll My Sons centres on Joe Keller, a man who is charged with shipping defective aircraft engines during World War Two. He escapes jail, but must deal with his guilt when his co-worker takes the blame and is convicted.\nIt explores themes of shame, denial, grief and loyalty, focusing on Joe's complex relationships with those around him, including with his wife Kate (who will be played by Jean-Baptiste). \nThe production, directed by Ivo Van Hove, will play at the Wyndham's Theatre from 14 November to 7 February 2026.\nSpeaking from Los Angeles, where she lives, Jean-Baptiste said: \"All things that deal with the family and relationships remain relevant throughout time, they sort of transcend in that way, and to me it just felt like being able to delve into something that's quite personal.\n\"But also the way that Ivo does stuff kind of feels timeless, and I just felt that this was something that would be really interesting to explore.\"\nShe noted: \"Some of the language is of the time, but I'm interested in the challenge of making it very relevant now, and dealing with loss, denial, guilt are things the human beings do throughout time.\"\nThe play has been revived several times over the decades, and was last performed in London in 2019, with Sally Field and Bill Pullman appearing in a production at the Old Vic. \nAll My Sons will mark Van Hove's third Miller production, having directed A View From A Bridge and The Crucible, which both played in London and on Broadway. \nVan Hove described All My Sons as \"a devastating exploration of guilt, responsibility, and the far-reaching consequences of our choices, especially in times of war\".\nAsked about her ambition for the new production, Jean-Baptiste said: \"I hope it's just something that's fresh, leaves the audience thinking or feeling, that would be my only hope for the production, that it tells a new story, of an old story.\"\nIn a statement, Cranston added: \"Arthur Miller, Ivo Van Hove, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu...

        "article_text": "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.\nIt looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.\nIt is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.\nScientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.\nThe development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.\nBut what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.\nA lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.\nFor a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.\n\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"\nChildren who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains. \n\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"\nDuring the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.\nKey to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.\n\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"\nThis skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school. \n\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"\nIn another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.\nA research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.\n\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.\n\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"\nThe study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.\nThe Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.\nThe project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.\nOne study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.\nThanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.\nAnd the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.\nIn this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.\nEmily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.\n\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"\nHelping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.\n\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"\nHenry and Jaxon finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.\n\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to. \n\"Why wouldn't you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "The Great Gatsby is synonymous with parties, glitz and glamour \u2013 but this is just one of many misunderstandings about the book that began with its first publication a century ago, in April 1925.\nFew characters in literature or indeed life embody an era quite so tenaciously as Jay Gatsby does the Jazz Age. Almost a century after he was written into being, F Scott Fitzgerald's doomed romantic has become shorthand for decadent flappers, champagne fountains and never-ending parties. Cut loose by pop culture from the text into which he was born, his name adorns everything from condominiums to hair wax and a limited-edition cologne (it contains notes of vetiver, pink pepper and Sicilian lime). It's now possible to lounge on a Gatsby sofa, check in at the Gatsby hotel, even chow down on a Gatsby sandwich \u2013 essentially a supersize, souped-up chip butty.\nIncongruous though that last item sounds, naming anything after the man formerly known as James Gatz seems more than a touch problematic. After all, flamboyant host is just one part of his complicated identity. He's also a bootlegger, up to his neck in criminal enterprise, not to mention a delusional stalker whose showmanship comes to seem downright tacky. If he embodies the potential of the American Dream, then he also illustrates its limitations: here is a man, let's not forget, whose end is destined to be as pointless as it is violent.\nMisunderstanding has been a part of The Great Gatsby's story from the very start. Grumbling to his friend Edmund Wilson shortly after the novel was published in April 1925, Fitzgerald declared that \"of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about\". Fellow writers like Edith Wharton admired it plenty, but as the critic Maureen Corrigan relates in her book So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures, popular reviewers read it as crime fiction, and were decidedly underwhelmed by it at that. Fitzgerald's Latest A Dud, ran a headline in the New York World. The novel achieved only so-so sales, and by the time of the author's death in 1940, copies of a very modest second print run had long since been remaindered.\nGatsby's luck began to change when it was selected as a giveaway by the US military. With World War Two drawing to a close, almost 155,000 copies were distributed in a special Armed Services Edition, creating a new readership overnight. As the 1950s dawned, the flourishing of the American Dream quickened the novel's topicality, and by the 1960s, it was enshrined as a set text. It's since become such a potent force in pop culture that even those who've never read it feel as if they have, helped along, of course, by Hollywood. It was in 1977, just a few short years after Robert Redford starred in the title role of an adaptation scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, that\u00a0the word \"Gatsbyesque\" was first recorded.\nAlong with Baz Luhrmann's divisive 2013 film extravaganza, the book has spawned graphic novels, an immersive theatrical experience and a television film, broadcast in 2000, with Paul Rudd, Toby Stephens and Mira Sorvino. And since the novel's copyright expired in 2021, enabling anyone to adapt it without permission from its estate, the Gatsby industry has exploded. Early calls for a Muppets adaptation may have come to nothing (never say never), but a musical with songs by Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine opened (and closed) on Broadway last year; a separate, Tony-winning musical, The Great Gatsby, is still running on Broadway and is about to open in London; and author Min Jin Lee and cultural critic Wesley Morris both wrote fresh introductions to 2021 editions of the book.\nIf this all leaves Fitzgerald purists twiddling their pearls like worry beads, it's quite possible that while some such projects may further perpetuate the myth that throwing a Gatsby-themed party could be anything other than sublimely clueless, others may yield fresh insights into a text whose very familiarity often leads us to skate over its complexities. Take, for instance, Michael Farris Smith's new novel, Nick. The title refers, of course, to Nick Carraway, the narrator of Gatsby, who here gets his own fully formed backstory. It's the tale of a Midwesterner who goes off to Europe to fight in World War One and comes back changed, as much by a whirlwind love affair in Paris as by trench warfare. There's room for an impulsive sojourn in the New Orleans underworld before he heads off to Long Island's West Egg.\nLike many, Smith first encountered the novel in high school. \"I just completely didn\u2019t get it\", he tells the BBC, from his home in Oxford, Mississippi. \"They seemed like a lot of people complaining about things they really shouldn't be complaining about.\" It was only when he picked it up again while living abroad in his late 20s that he began to understand the novel's power. \"It was a very surreal reading experience for me. It seemed like something on almost every page was speaking to me in a way I had not expected,\" he recalls.\nReaching the scene in which Carraway suddenly remembers it's his 30th birthday, Smith was filled with questions about what kind of a person Gatsby's narrator really was. \"It seemed to me that there had been some real trauma that had made him so detached, even from his own self. The thought crossed my mind that it would be really interesting if someone were to write Nick's story,\" he says. In 2014, by then a published author in his 40s, he sat down to do just that, telling neither his agent nor his editor. It was only when he delivered the manuscript 10 months later that he learned copyright law meant he'd have to wait until 2021 to publish it.\nSmith points to a quote from one of Fitzgerald's contemporaries as having provided the key to understanding Carraway. \"Ernest Hemingway says in [his memoir] A Moveable Feast that we didn't trust anyone who wasn't in the war, and to me that felt like a natural beginning for Nick.\" Smith imagines Carraway, coping with PTSD and shellshock, returning home to a nation that he no longer recognises. It's a far cry from the riotous razzmatazz of all that partying, yet Carraway is, Smith suggests, the reason Fitzgerald's novel remains read. \"Maybe it's not the champagne and the dancing, maybe it is those feelings of wondering where we are, the sense that anything can crumble at any moment, that keep Gatsby meaningful from one generation to the next.\"\nMore like this:\nWilliam Cain, an expert in American literature and the Mary Jewett Gaiser Professor of English at Wellesley College, agrees that Nick is crucial to understanding the novel's richness. \"Fitzgerald gave some thought to structuring it in the third person but ultimately he chose Nick Carraway, a first-person narrator who would tell Gatsby's story, and who would be an intermediary between us and Gatsby. We have to respond to and understand Gatsby and, as we do so, remain aware that we're approaching him through Nick's very particular perspective, and through Nick's very ambivalent relationship to Gatsby, which is simultaneously full of praise and full of severe criticism, even at some moments contempt,\" he says.\nLike Smith, Cain first encountered the novel as a student. It was a different era \u2013 the 1960s \u2013 but even so, little attention was paid to Nick. Cain recalls instead talk of symbolism \u2013 the legendary green light, for example, and Gatsby's fabled automobile. It's a reminder that, in a way, the education system is as much to blame as pop culture for our limited readings of this seminal text. It may be a Great American Novel but, at fewer than 200 pages, its sublimely economical storytelling makes its study points very easy to access. Ironically, given that this is a novel of illusion and delusion, in which surfaces are crucial, we all too often overlook the texture of its prose. As Cain puts it, \"I think when we consider The Great Gatsby, we need to think about it not just as a novel that is an occasion or a point of departure for us to talk about big American themes and questions, but we have to really enter into the richness of Fitzgerald's actual page-to-page writing. We have to come to Gatsby, yes, aware of its social and cultural significance, but also we need to return to it as a literary experience.\"\nCain re-reads the novel every two or three years but frequently finds himself thinking about it in between \u2013 in 2020, for instance, when US President Biden, accepting the Democratic nomination at the DNC, spoke of the right to pursue dreams of a better future. The American Dream is, of course, another of Gatsby's Big Themes, and one that continues to be misunderstood. \"Fitzgerald shows that that dream is very powerful, but that it is indeed a very hard one for most Americans to realise. It feeds them great hopes, great desires, and it's extraordinary, the efforts that so many of them make to fulfil those dreams and those desires, but that dream is beyond the reach of many, and many, they give up all too much to try to achieve that great success,\" Cain points out. Among the obstacles, Fitzgerald seems to suggest, are hard-and-fast class lines that no amount of money will enable Gatsby to cross. It's a view that resonates with a mood that Cain says he's been picking up on among his students \u2013 a certain \"melancholy\" for the American Dream, the feeling fanned by racial and economic inequalities that the pandemic has only deepened.\nIn other certain respects, the novel hasn't worn quite so well. While Fitzgerald showed where his allegiances lay by highlighting the brute ugliness of Tom Buchanan's white supremacist beliefs, he repeatedly describes African Americans as \"bucks\". The novel makes for frustrating reading from a feminist perspective, too: its female characters lack dimensionality and agency, and are seen instead through the prism of male desire. But the path is now open to endless creative responses to those more dated and unpleasant aspects. Jane Crowther's newly published novel, Gatsby, updates the plot to the 21st Century, and flips the genders to feature a female Jay Gatsby and a male Danny Buchanan. And Claire Anderson-Wheeler's The Gatsby Gambit is a murder mystery which invents a younger sister for Fitzgerald's eponymous anti-hero: Greta Gatsby \u2013 get it?\nTo an impressive degree, however, the renewed attention brought by the copyright expiry and the centenary shows not just how relevant and seductive the text of Fitzgerald's novel remains, but how very alive it's always been. Pick it up at 27, and you'll find a different novel to the one you read as a teenager. Revisit it again at 45, and it'll feel like another book altogether. Copyright has never had any bearing on the impact of the words it governs.\nWhen Smith was finally able to publish Nick in 2021, he returned once more to The Great Gatsby before turning in his last edit. \"I think it will be a novel that's always evolving in my head, and always changing based on who I am,\" he says. \"That's what great novels do.\"\nA version of this article was originally published in 2021.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

But while many of Trump's most dramatic \"America first\" actions are aimed at other countries, his sweeping new policy changes are also affecting how the US tells its own multicultural story.\nSeveral highly touristed landmarks in the US are already facing significant changes.\nOn 27 March, Trump signed an executive order titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, arguing that there has been \"a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation's history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth\". The order took specific aim at the Smithsonian Institution, whose 21 museums, 21 libraries and many other research and cultural centres comprise the world's largest museum complex and were visited by nearly 17 million people in 2024.\n\"Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement,\" the order states, \"the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of divisive, race-centred ideology.\"\nThe order threatens to bar congressional funds from institutions that espouse \"improper, divisive or anti-American\" beliefs. As an example of this, Trump cited programming from the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History & Culture, the only national museum devoted exclusively to documenting African American life, history and culture from slavery to the modern era.\nHeadquartered on the National Mall in Washington DC, some of the Smithsonian's many museums focus on marginalised communities in the US \u2013 including the National Museum of the American Indian,the National Museum of African Art, the National Museum of the American Latino and the embattled National Museum of African American History and Culture.\u00a0\nMany activists and historians have expressed outrage over the order's broader meaning and argued that it is actually a brazen attempt to do what Trump is denouncing: rewrite US history. This begs the question, which version of the US will visitors find?\n\"It seems like we're headed in the direction where there's even an attempt to deny that the institution of slavery even existed, or that Jim Crow laws and segregation and racial violence against Black communities, Black families, Black individuals even occurred,\" said Dr Clarissa Myrick-Harris White, a historian and Africana studies professor at the historically Black Morehouse College in a statement to the Associated Press.\nThis concern was echoed by the American Historical Association, whose 10,000 members represent the world's largest organisation of professional historians. In a statement co-signed by 31 organisations, the association says the executive order \"egregiously misrepresents the work of the Smithsonian Institution\", which was established by Congress more than 175 years ago for the \"increase and diffusion of knowledge\".\n\"The stories that have shaped our past include not only elements that make us proud but also aspects that make us acutely aware of tragedies in our nation's history,\" the statement notes. \"No person, no nation, is perfect, and we should all \u2013 as individuals and as nations \u2013 learn from our imperfections.\"\u00a0\nSome feel Trump's targeting of the Smithsonian is part of a broader culture war he has been waging against \"woke ideology\" across many of the nation's federally run institutions. Since returning to office, Trump has worked to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, which oversaw grant funding for numerous Native American, Native Hawaiian, Latinx and African American museums across the country; and Trump's agencies have reportedly issued a list of words to limit or disappear from government websites, like \"women\", \"Black\" and \"cultural heritage\".\nSome of these references have already been removed from websites or displays of traveller-friendly landmarks. In February, Stonewall National Monument in New York City, which is run by the US National Park Service, erased references to transgender people. In March, Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia \u2013 which is managed by the US Department of the Army \u2013 scrubbed its website of any information highlighting the contributions of African American, Hispanic or female servicemembers, including removing stories about veteran and civil rights leader Medgar Evers and the Tuskegee Airmen, the US's first Black Airforce pilots. In nearby Washington DC, a two-block section of 16th Street leading to the White House with the words \"Black Lives Matter\" was recently repaved in response to threats to cut transportation funding if the plaza was not renamed.\n\"If you take a broad brush and say we've spent too much time talking about folks other than old white [men], then you have wiped out a lot of what actually makes America great,\" said Greg Werkheiser, founding partner of Cultural Heritage Partners, a law firm that specialises in protecting cultural heritage sites. \"A lot of places around the world have had similar challenges and have not overcome them. We have. And those lessons are not lessons of self-loathing and tragedy, they're lessons about how we keep pushing towards a more perfect union.\"\nSince the Black Lives Matter protests five years ago, many museums and other cultural institutions have sought to include more diverse perspectives in their exhibitions, a move that often boosted their visitor numbers. But as Werkheiser explained, the Trump administration's unprecedented exertion of influence on cultural institutions is especially problematic for those that specialise in telling stories from Black, Asian, Latinx and LGBTQ+ perspectives, since many of these places rely on federal funding to keep them afloat.\n\"That baseline of commitment [from the government] is essential to ensure that the ebbs and flows of private donors don't take out institutions. When we take that away, we make these institutions very unstable.\"\nVisitors to the US may now find that even larger museums and organisations have been forced to make sweeping changes to their programming in light of the new policies. The DC-based Art Museum of the Americas cancelled two planned exhibitions highlighting the work of Black and LGBTQ+ artists in March, reportedly in response to the administration's new diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. Meanwhile, the United States Marine Band, the country's oldest continually active musical association, recently cancelled a concert that was supposed to feature young musicians of colour. Perhaps most famously, in February Trump seized control of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, one of the US's premier arts institutions. Since Trump's takeover, a host of acts have cancelled their planned appearances in protest.\n\"If it didn't matter, they wouldn't try to stop us,\" said Ashley Rogers, executive director of the Whitney Plantation, the only plantation museum in Louisiana focussing exclusively on the experience of the people who were forcibly enslaved there. \"These stories that we've been telling, they explain us to ourselves. You cannot understand the United States today without understanding our history with regard to race, slavery, relationships with Indigenous people and the genocides \u2013 all of these things that are 'bad'. We have to understand them, because they explain who we are today.\"\nWhere to visit:\nHere are three museums, that Werkheiser and the staff of Cultural Heritage Partners feel help to tell the story of US history, and could use visitor support.\n\u2022 Museum of the Cherokee People\n (Cherokee, NC) \u2013 One of the oldest tribally operated museums in the country, the museum's mission is \"to preserve and perpetuate the history, culture and stories of the Cherokee people\".\n\u2022 Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia\n (Richmond, VA) \u2013 Housed in the historic Leigh Street Armory, the institution highlights the history, culture and contributions of African Americans from Virginia, from civil rights heroes to Nascar's first Black race car driver.\n\u2022 National Museum of Women in the Arts\n (Washington DC) \u2013 From the 17th-Century work of Mary Beale to the modern rhinestone-encrusted portraits by Mickalene Thomas, this museum tells little-known stories of women in the arts.\nThe Whitney and other nearby locations, including a centuries-old sugar-cane plantation that once housed Africans and Creole people recently lost a bid to be designated as a National Historic Landmark District, a process that had been in the works for several years. The designation would have protected the Whitney and other historical sites from outside development, a necessary move as many in the local area had long wanted to clear the path for more industrial development, according to Rogers. She added that local government officials requested to have the application pulled from consideration once the Trump administration got in office.\nBoth Rogers and Werkheiser expressed concern that the budget cuts Trump is imposing on cultural institutions might have long-term repercussions. They stressed that even if funding cuts and DEI restrictions are ultimately overturned in court, they may still trigger a long-lasting drop in the financial stability of smaller institutions \u2013 especially those that seek to tell stories from diverse perspectives, which may not attract as many visitors as larger, more \"mainstream\" museums. Historians, scholars, artists and others employed by cultural institutions who carry this specialised knowledge are also at risk.\n\"These artefacts and the sites that represent our shared history, are vulnerable to destruction and to permanent loss, but I'm also worried that the people who preserve those histories are also irreplaceable,\" said Werkheiser. \"I'm very concerned about the scholars and government employees who have devoted their careers to preserving our country's cultural heritage. Many have lost their jobs or worried that they might soon be out of work, and we know that their knowledge and expertise are vital.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022 How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n\u2022 'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\nRogers and Werkheiser stressed the importance of institutions and individuals pushing back against these policies as much as possible. They also highlighted the role of visitors in helping to support cultural institutions that tell stories from diverse perspectives, particularly in difficult times.\n\"What's happening at [the] Whitney, the way that this administration's policies are affecting us, that is happening in everyone's local community,\" said Rogers. \"There is going to be a local museum, a local library [near you] who is really struggling, and they need our support more than ever right now.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Fifty years after Monty Python and the Holy Grail redefined comedy, stars Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam look back on the freedoms \u2013 and limitations \u2013 that shaped the film.\nAn independent British comedy made on a shoestring by a television sketch troupe? It sounds like a film destined to be forgotten within weeks of leaving cinemas \u2013 assuming it reaches cinemas in the first place. But Monty Python and the Holy Grail is still revered as one of the greatest ever big-screen comedies, 50 years on from its release in April 1975. Terry Gilliam, who co-directed the film with Terry Jones, thinks he knows why. \"Every time I watch it I'm completely bowled over by how incredibly wonderful it is,\" Gilliam tells the BBC. \"It's still so funny, and I just love everything about it.\"\nThe Monty Python team first appeared on TV together in a BBC series, Monty Python's Flying Circus, in 1969. Five of the six members \u2013 Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin \u2013 had honed their craft in student comedy societies at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The sixth, Gilliam, had moved to the UK from the US, and provided animated segments which linked their surreal sketches. In 1971, some of these sketches were reshot and compiled into a film, And Now for Something Completely Different, but the Pythons had ambitions to make a bona fide feature film \u2013 or some of them did, at least.\n\"It was by no means unanimous that we should do a film after the television series,\" says Palin. \"John, to his credit, was doing Fawlty Towers, Eric was doing Rutland Weekend Television, but the two Terrys wanted to direct a film, and I loved cinema as well, so that was the only way forward \u2013 not to make it three Python shows tacked one after the other, but to make it a full cinematic experience. No other television series had, as far as I know, leapt into cinema, but we thought we'd have a go.\"\nChapman and Jones have both died (or ceased to be, to borrow a line from one of their most beloved sketches), and Cleese and Idle were unavailable to talk to the BBC, but Gilliam and Palin reminisce cheerfully about Holy Grail \u2013 Palin quietly affable, Gilliam cackling with enthusiasm.\nPalin mentions that he and Jones had made a pre-Python series of historical sketches, The Complete and Utter History of Britain, and Jones would go on to be an acclaimed medieval historian. However, that wasn't why the team chose to build their first proper feature film around King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.\n\"We had to do something that used all six of us,\" says Palin, \"and of course the Round Table was the perfect template for that because we could each play one of the knights. And also because the Holy Grail legend was something that everyone had heard of, but nobody really knew anything about it. You could create any sort of story based around the search for a Grail.\"\nMichael Palin's Five Culture Shifters\nThe Goon Show (1951 to 1960)\nThe Goon Shows had a profound effect on me, and I know they did on John Cleese and Terry Jones. For me, they represented a moving-on from my parents' preferences for television and radio. It was just the profusion of ideas \u2013 half an hour full of strange images, weird noises, amazing sound.\nHeartbreak Hotel by Elvis Presley (1956)\nThat was a culture shifter for me, because unlike most of the pop songs I was listening to at that time, it made me think that this was something for my generation, and not the generation before.\nLady Chatterley's Lover by DH Lawrence (1928, published in 1960)\nThese are rather personal choices reflecting on my relationship with my parents. When they got a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover, it made me feel better towards them. It was a great breakthrough for me to know that they were as interested in sex as I was!\nThe Rocky Horror Show by Richard O'Brien (1973)\nJohn Cleese invited me along to see the live show in a small theatre in the King's Road. I was quite gobsmacked by this funny and outrageous celebration of the gay world \u2013 and there wasn't much of it around at that time. I remember thinking, wow, I've grown up a bit, having seen this.\nThe London Olympics opening ceremony by Danny Boyle (2012)\nIt wasn't saying \"good old Britain\" or \"imperial Britain\" or anything like that. It was about our way of life in Britain today \u2013 and done in such a creative, inventive way. To have a whole sequence about the National Health Service, instead of fireworks and pompous costumes and flags and endless marching \u2013 here was something celebratory in a way I'd never expected.\nNot that Monty Python and the Holy Grail was ever going to be a straightforward Arthurian adventure. Just as mind-bogglingly absurdist as the sketches that made the group's name, the film boasted faux-Swedish subtitles, Gilliam's instantly recognisable animation, a Trojan Rabbit, the Knights Who Say \"Ni!\", a debate about whether swallows are strong enough to carry coconuts and a modern-day historian who pops up to comment on the action before being brutally slain by a passing knight. It was, in other words, a unique proposition, which could be why the BBC chose not to invest in it. With the help of theatrical impresario Michael White, the Pythons ended up securing funds from some unusual sources, including\u00a0Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and various record companies.\nPalin: \"I say to people, 'Led Zeppelin gave us \u00a350,000 \u2013 and look where they are now.'\"\nGilliam: \"Thank God for rock'n'roll is all I can say.\"\nThe upside to this unconventional set of backers, Gilliam adds, was that the team had complete creative freedom. \"Looking back, it always seemed to me very pure, what we were doing. We were just trying to make ourselves laugh, at the same time as saying interesting things, serious things. There were no outside forces. We, the six of us, made the decisions, end of conversation, and that's a rare thing. Musicians get away with that all the time. Not many film-makers do.\"\nThe downside was that even with the Pythons' celebrity fans chipping in \"a little bit of money\", in Palin's words, the film's budget was less than \u00a3300,000 ($393,000). This wasn't much for a sweeping fantasy set in medieval Britain, so the team had to be inventive.\nThey couldn't afford to have knights riding on horseback, for instance, so King Arthur (Chapman) and his men trot along on foot, with servants behind them tapping halved coconut shells together to make the clip-clop noise of horses' hooves. Another bit of crafty problem-solving came when the team's permission to shoot at several Scottish castles was rescinded at the last minute. Instead, they simply shot Doune Castle near Stirling, Scotland from numerous different angles so that it appeared to be a different castle each time.\n\"What I love is that Doune Castle has reaped the benefit,\" says Palin. \"It's now the centre of a sort of Python tourist industry, and it's the only castle gift shop to sell ready-cut coconut shells.\"\nDespite its limited budget, one key reason why the film has lasted is that it looks like an authentic period epic, complete with atmospheric footage shot on location in Scotland. \"We were frustrated by the television shows because they had rather bad sets and bad lighting and bad everything,\" says Gilliam of himself and Jones, \"and both of us were big fans of Bruegel as a painter and Pasolini as a film-maker. We wanted all of those textures, all of that reality. I think that's what is totally unique about the film: some of the film-makers were serious historians and real film directors.\"\nNot all of the Pythons saw the necessity of those Bruegel-and-Pasolini-like textures, though. \"One of the joys of the film was looking for locations, places that had history, and trying to make them beautiful,\" says Gilliam. \"But there were days when I got in fights with the rest of the team, who had no interest in creating the times and making it real.\"\nSome members of the group were \"constantly moaning\" about shooting outdoors, especially when the Scottish rain waterlogged their heavy woollen tunics, Gilliam says. \"Mike was fine, Terry was fine, but the others just hated wearing uncomfortable costumes. They just wanted to be funny. But I said, 'You're missing the point. To be funny you've got to be real first. All this has got to be genuine.' I just thought the humour would be much, much funnier if we could ground it in reality.\"\nUltimately, the two Terrys got their way, and, as Gilliam and Palin agree, Chapman's commitment to the reality of a proud but peeved King Arthur contrasted perfectly with the silliness around him. \"Everything about him was totally believable,\" says Gilliam.\nThe only trouble with this naturalistic approach to the Middle Ages was that it came to be associated in viewers\u2019 minds with Monty Python, Gilliam says. That meant that any other films with a similar aesthetic \u2013 mud, smoke, grey weather, crumbling castles \u2013 could seem Pythonesque, however earnest they were attempting to be. Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac was released in the UK in August 1975, remembers Gilliam. \"It was deadly serious. And people started laughing because it was such a serious attempt to do the real thing, and it wasn't as good as what we were doing.\"\nHoly Grail had profound effects on the Pythons themselves, too. The success of the film convinced Gilliam that he wasn't just an animator, but a director, \"because the credits said that\", and it boosted the team's international profile, \"expanding our control over humanity\".\nIt also prompted Monty Python to make a follow-up. \"There was a feeling even after we'd done The Holy Grail of 'OK, we've done this film, bit of an experiment, but even if it works, we've all got other things to do,'\" says Palin. \"But as we did the publicity around the world, we spent a lot of time in airports, and the idea that became The Life of Brian was born in one of these bored discussions while waiting for a flight to Dublin or somewhere. Eric came up with the title, Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory, and that steered us towards the Bible story, and it meant that we were all prepared to give time to writing another film \u2013 and that was very much on the borderline. It might just have been one film, and that was that.\"\nTerry Gilliam's Five Culture Shifters\nRosa Parks' protest (1955)\nWhat a lady. What's so interesting is that the right person in the right place does something, and suddenly normal people who don't normally pay attention to things say, \"Why is this woman not able to sit on the bus like a human being?\" These powerful images hopefully wake people up.\nHeartbreak Hotel by Elvis Presley (1956) and I Want to Hold Your Hand by The Beatles (1963)\nThe first time I heard I Want to Hold Your Hand was a huge shift. I was sitting in my car in a parking lot in university, and the sound just got to me. Before that it was Elvis, Heartbreak Hotel. In both cases, I was on my own, I turned on my radio, and the world changed. This was something new and special.\nThe Pill (1960)\nI was around when the pill popped up \u2013 and suddenly sex was rampant, ladies and gentlemen! But it was also wonderful how, as sex increased, love seemed to increase, too, and so we had the Summer of Love.\nContemporary politics (2025)\nI think we're now going through the biggest cultural shift I've experienced in my whole life. It has gotten very weird to see how quickly all these extreme right-wingers are blossoming.\nNot only did Holy Grail lead to two further films, Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979) and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (1983), it was adapted by Idle and John Du Prez into a long-running Broadway show, Spamalot, which won the Tony award for best musical in 2003. Both Palin and Gilliam sing the show's praises, Gilliam's one reservation being that \"it wasn't muddy enough\".\nEven more remarkably, many of the film's phrases have entered the British lexicon, and some of its characters have become archetypes: failing politicians are regularly compared to the Black Knight, who is determined to keep fighting even when his limbs have been lopped off, while Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot is brought up when someone is seen to be especially cowardly.\nThese characters are so resonant, Gilliam suggests, because even at its most ludicrous, Monty Python's humour is \"about real people with real attitudes\", adding: \"and Britain is becoming more and more like the characters in The Holy Grail!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Clueless revolutionised the high school comedy\n\u2022 Richard Linklater on his masterpiece, Boyhood\n\u2022 The 60s icon who changed style forever\nThe characters who are cited to Palin most often, he says, are the Knights Who Say \"Ni!\". \"Apparently Elvis Presley liked watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail near to the end of his life. I don't know if he was taking it in, but just the idea of Elvis Presley saying 'Ni' gives me happiness during dark times.\"\nThe film has, arguably, offered happiness to many others who watched it during dark times, too. The Pythons weren't on a quest for the secret of immortal comedy, but somehow they stumbled on that Grail. \"I just think Python was the perfect chemical balance, the six of us,\" says Gilliam. \"We're all very different, and to put those six people in the same room, and they all basically agree on what they're doing, it's an extraordinary thing. Without any one of us, it was not the same. When Graham died [in 1989], it was already changing. And with Terry [Jones] gone [in 2020]\u2026 people say, 'Wouldn't it be great for Python to get together again?' It would be pointless to get together again! It wouldn't work. It was a magical chemical balance. It was spectacular.\"\nCulture Shifters is an interview series in which high-profile creatives reflect on a work of theirs which made a big impact on the world.
