He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.\nUS officials accused Sharifullah of being a member of IS-K, a group that took credit for the attack and that has been proscribed as a terror organisation by governments around the world.\nAt least 170 Afghans died alongside 13 US service members in the attack, which resulted in intense criticism for then-US President Joe Biden.\nCurrent US President Donald Trump, who often blamed Biden and Former Vice-President Kamala Harris for the service members' deaths, announced Sharifullah's arrest in his address to Congress on Tuesday.\n\"He is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,\" Trump told his audience.\nThe next day, Sharifullah appeared in court wearing a blue jail jumpsuit, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. He stood at about 5ft tall (150cm), wore a surgical face mask and communicated in a packed courtroom via an interpreter.\nAfter a brief hearing that discussed his lack of assets and need for a defence lawyer, the federal judge overseeing the case ordered Sharifullah to be held in custody until a formal detention hearing on Monday.\nSeveral justice department officials who were recently appointed to office by Trump praised the president for the arrest, and FBI chief Kash Patel shared an image of him in custody.\n\"Under President Trump's strong leadership on the world stage, this Department of Justice will ensure that terrorists like Mohammad Sharifullah have no safe haven, no second chances, and no worse enemy than the United States of America,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said.\nA family member of two Afghans who died in the aftermath of the attack said he was upset with Trump after the speech. \n\"He talked about the 13 US soldiers killed but not anything about us,\" he told the BBC. \"We want the Americans to pay attention to us and take us to America as they promised,\" the man added. \nThe bombing of Abbey Gate at the Kabul airport occurred in the final days of the chaotic US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. The attacker triggered a bomb in a crowd of thousands of Afghans who had gathered at the airport in hopes of being evacuated before the Taliban took full control of the country.\nCongressional criticism of the Biden administration spiked in the aftermath, and it caused a decline in the public's confidence in the then-president.\nThe justice department alleged that Sharifullah \"admitted to helping prepare for the Abbey Gate, including scouting a route near the airport for an attack\" during an interview with the FBI.\nSharifullah allegedly admitted to his involvement in several other attacks during the interview, including a June 2016 suicide bombing attack on the Canadian embassy in Kabul and the March 2024 gunmen attack on Crocus City Hall near Moscow, Russia.\nRussia arrested four gunmen in connection with the attack in which it accused Ukraine of being involved.\n\"Sharifullah admitted that, on behalf of ISIS-K, he had shared instructions on how to use AK-style rifles and other weapons to would-be attackers.

        "article_text": "Syria's defence ministry says it has completed a military operation in the country's western coastal region, after days of violence in which hundreds of people have been killed.\nSecurity forces had \"neutralized\" loyalists of former president Bashar al-Assad in several towns in Latakia and Tartous provinces and were \"paving the way for life to return to normal\", a ministry spokesman said.\nA monitoring group says more than 1,500 people have been killed since Thursday, including 1,068 civilians.\nGunmen loyal to the Sunni Islamist-led government have been accused of carrying out revenge killings against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect following a deadly ambush on a security patrol.\nThe interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has said he will set up an independent committee to investigate the killings and insisted the perpetrators would be held accountable.\nThe violence is the worst in Syria since Sharaa led the lightning rebel offensive that overthrew Assad in December, ending 13 years of devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others were forced to flee their homes.\nDefence ministry spokesman Hassan Abdul Ghani announced on X that the security operation in Latakia and Tartous had ended after \"achieving all the specified objectives\".\n\"Our forces have neutralised the security cells and remnants of the former regime from the town of al-Mukhtareyah, the town of al-Mazairaa, the area of al-Zobar, and other locations in Latakia province, as well as Dalia town, Tanita town, and Qadmous in Tartous province, resulting in the thwarting of threats and securing the area,\" he said.\nHe also said that public institutions in the region were now able to resume their work, adding: \"We are preparing for the return of normal life and working to reinforce security and stability.\"\nAbdul Ghani promised that security forces would also \"give the investigating committee the full opportunity to uncover the circumstances of these incidents, verify the facts and deliver justice to the oppressed\".\nIn an interview on Monday, Sharaa acknowledged that there were \"many violations\" following the outbreak of violence and promised to punish everyone responsible, including his own allies if necessary.\n\"Syria is a state of law. The law will take its course on all,\" he told Reuters news agency.\n\"We fought to defend the oppressed, and we won't accept that any blood be shed unjustly, or goes without punishment or accountability, even among those closest to us,\" he said. \nThe government launched the operation in Latakia province in response to a growing insurgency by Assad loyalists in recent weeks. The region is the heartland of the Alawite sect, to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged.\nOn Thursday, security personnel were ambushed by gunmen in the town of Jableh as they tried to arrest a wanted Assad regime official. At least 13 officers were reportedly killed.\nSecurity forces responded by sending reinforcements to the region, who were joined by armed supporters of the government. Over the next four days, they stormed many Alawite towns and villages, where residents said they carried out revenge killings and lootings.\nA widely shared video showed the bodies of at least two dozen men in civilian clothing, piled in the yard of a house, in al-Mukhtareyah. Elsewhere, accounts emerged of fighters searching for Alawite members and killing entire families on the spot.\nHiba, an Alawite woman in Baniyas, told the BBC that Chechen fighters loyal to the government had attacked her neighbourhood.\n\"Our neighbours were killed including children. They came and took everything, gold, everything\u2026 They stole all of the cars in the neighbourhood. They even went to the supermarket and they took everything from the shelves.\"\n\"We were waiting for our turn. We didn't know when it would come. We saw death, we saw people dying in front of us and now all of our friends, our neighbours, are gone,\" she added. \"They killed innocent people in cold blood who had nothing to do with any of this.\"\nAn Alawite man whose family lives in Baniyas said in a voice message that a relative was kidnapped from his home by gunmen from Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who went door to door searching for Alawites. \n\"His mother made a mistake opening the door when she did. An HTS member fired between her legs... so she screamed,\" he said. \"Her son... ran to see what happened with her. When they [saw] him, they took him with them and disappeared. And they didn't return.\"\nHe also said residents of Alawite neighbourhoods of Baniyas were still hiding in their houses on Monday morning because they were too afraid to venture outside to see if it was safe. \nThe bodies of those killed had been buried in a mass grave near a shrine on the outskirts of the town, while those who were kidnapped had not yet returned, he added.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that more than 1,540 people have been killed in Latakia, Tartous, Hama and Homs provinces.\nThey included 1,068 civilians, the vast majority of them Alawites who it said had died as a result of \"killings, field executions and ethnic cleansing operations\" by security personnel or pro-government fighters, as well as 230 security personnel and 250 pro-Assad fighters.\nSecurity sources also told Reuters that 300 security personnel had been killed.\nThe BBC has been unable to independently verify the death tolls.\nState news agency Sana said a mass grave containing the bodies of security personnel had been found in the former president's hometown of Qardaha on Sunday.

        "article_text": "Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Germany as airport workers stage a nationwide strike over pay, posing a major disruption for air travellers.\nThe industrial action, led by the trade union Verdi, began unexpectedly on Sunday at Hamburg Airport, before expanding to a nationwide strike. \nPassengers at Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin and other major hubs have been urged not to travel to airports, with operations severely disrupted. Frankfurt, Germany's busiest airport, said passengers would be unable to board flights and transfer would \"almost certainly\" be affected.\nVerdi, which represents public sector and transport workers, is in an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions. \nGerman media reports thousands of flights could be cancelled across the day, disrupting travel for more than 500,000 passengers.\nThe Lufthansa group, whose main hub is in Frankfurt, confirmed \"delays and extensive cancellations\" across all its airlines.\nMeanwhile, Munich Airport warned of a \"greatly reduced flight schedule\". This includes flights by Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air.\nKatja Bromm, spokeswoman for Hamburg Airport, where all 143 departures scheduled on Monday have already been cancelled, said Verdi was \"dishonourable\" to call a strike without notice at the start of the holiday season.\nShe said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travellers who have nothing to do with the disputes\".\nA spokesman for Verdi accepted that the strike would affect many, but said the travel disruption was necessary to extracting a better pay offer. \nLars Stubbe, the union's Hamburg representative, told the BBC: \"The workers are aware that disruptions do happen, and they are uncomfortable with that, but in any case, it is the employer that caused these strikes because they haven't put a negotiable offer on the table.\"\nMany of Frankfurt Airport's 1,770 scheduled flights have already been cancelled, while the majority of Munich's 820 flights are expected to be cancelled.\nHundreds more cancellations are anticipated across Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Berlin. \nMany passengers had already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it returned, according to public broadcaster NDR. \nADV, which represents major German airports, said the strike had \"almost completely paralysed air traffic\".\nVerdi's demands include an 8% pay rise, or at least \u20ac350 (\u00a3294) more per month, for all workers - and three extra days of holiday, plus one additional day for union members. \nStubbe said that while airport wages range were above minimum wage, ranging from \u20ac13-\u20ac25 per hour, workers in different roles - particularly security staff - received less annual leave than others.\n\"There have been two rounds of negotiations in which the employers have not yet offered one penny,\" he added. \n\"It is quite usual that we don't get any offers in the first round, but now even in the second round, the employers have basically said, 'No, we're not going to give you an offer because we don't have any money'.\"\nBDLS, the body which sets security workers' pay, said in a statement: \"The damage caused by this strike is almost exclusively to companies that are not at the negotiating table.\"\nIt called on the government to outlaw short-notice strikes, adding that air transport was \"essential for Germany as a business location\" which \"must not be exploited\" in collective pay disputes.\nRalph Beisel, ADV's general manager, said the strike was having an impact on European and global air traffic, leading to missed connections due to a \"domino effect\".\nHe called for reforms to German strike laws concerning \"critical\" infrastructure. \nThe so-called \"warning strike\", an established tactic in German wage negotiations, concerns two separate pay disputes: one relating to airport security workers, and a broader disagreement over pay for federal and municipal government employees.\nVerdi has also called for strikes in waste collection across several German cities, including Berlin, Essen and Kiel, where bins have gone unemptied since last week.\nPay talks for government workers are set to restart on Friday in Potsdam, while the next round of talks for airport security staff is scheduled to begin on 26 March.\nNiklas Benrath, of the VKA, which regulates pay and conditions for municipal workers, also criticised the strikes, saying Verdi's demands would cost nearly \u20ac15bn.\n\"With a total municipal debt of around \u20ac160bn, these demands are not financially viable,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "Gurpreet Singh was handcuffed, his legs shackled and a chain tied around his waist. He was led on to the tarmac in Texas by US Border Patrol, towards a waiting C-17 military transport aircraft.\nIt was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. \"It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,\" he said.\nGurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home.\nThere are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022.\nNow Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority.\nGurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered.\nAbout 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India.\nUS Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: \"If you cross illegally, you will be removed.\"\n\"We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,\" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. \"We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off.\"\nOpposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \"There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?\" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader.\nGurpreet said: \"The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains.\"\nAn Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled.\nBut on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath.\n\"No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,\" said Gurpreet.\nIn the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called \"agents\", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police. \nGurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached.\n\"I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,\" said Gurpreet.\nWhile the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are \"unpaid helpers\", including women working in family businesses.\n\"We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (\u00a3270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,\" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after.\n\"You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.\"\n\nGupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said.\nHe said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected.\nThen he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/\u00a336,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us.\nOn 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US.\nGurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way.\nFrom Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Dari\u00e9n Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle.\nA dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Dari\u00e9n Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing.\n\"I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,\" said Gurpreet. \"We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest.\"\nEach group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a \"donker\" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term \"donkey route\" used for illegal migration journeys.\nAt night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest.\n\"It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,\" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers.\n\"My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers.\"\nWhen they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.\nGurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego.\n\"We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,\" he said.\nGurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter.\nOnce in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \nDuring the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation.\nIf they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime. \nThis is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with.\nInstead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started.\nIn their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.\nAdditional reporting by Aakriti Thapar",

This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.\nThe government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth. \nThe UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.\nIvy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.\nThe firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.\n\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"\nDr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet. \nIt doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.\nIn this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.\n\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me. \n\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"\nThe FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods. \nProf May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.\n\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"\nBut Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.\n\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.\n\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Arriving in red will be cool' - Hamilton's Melbourne excitment\nLewis Hamilton's move to Ferrari is the single biggest storyline of the 2025 Formula 1 season.\nThe sport's biggest star - the only driver who truly transcends the sport - has joined its most iconic team, and interest in how their partnership develops is stratospheric.\nThese are the key questions as Hamilton begins his new adventure.\nHamilton signed with Ferrari in January 2024, just over six months after sealing a new contract with Mercedes.\nIt was the talks over that new Mercedes deal that led to the Ferrari move.\nMercedes wanted to offer Hamilton only a one-year contract - team boss Toto Wolff was planning for the future. The seven-time world champion knew he wanted to stay in F1 longer.\nThey compromised on what is known as a \"one-plus-one\" contract - a firm deal for 2024 with an option for 2025.\nBut Mercedes' reticence to commit to him led Hamilton to consider his future. He had always had a hankering after driving for Ferrari and he has a close relationship with their team boss Frederic Vasseur, which dates back 20 years to their time in the junior categories together.\nHamilton's single biggest ambition is to win the record eighth title of which he feels he was robbed by race director Michael Masi making up the rules and mishandling a late safety-car period in the 2021 title decider in Abu Dhabi.\nMercedes had not furnished him with a car in which he could do that since, so he had plenty of doubts on that front, too.\nHamilton approached Ferrari and the team were keen to do a deal. So when they offered him a longer contract - at least to the end of 2026 - and a close to 50% pay rise to a reputed salary of 65m euros (\u00a355m), it was a no-brainer.\nThe fact that Ferrari had finished 2023 in stronger shape than Mercedes made the decision even easier.\nIn 2024, Hamilton was comprehensively out-qualified by a team-mate for the first time in his career, ending the season 19-5 down to George Russell in their one-lap head-to-head, at an average deficit of 0.171 seconds.\nAlthough both won two races, Hamilton finished 22 points adrift in the championship.\nIt was a confusing situation, because in 2022 and 2023, the two had been closely matched in qualifying, and one of them finished ahead in the championship one year and the other the other.\nThe bottom line is that Hamilton struggled with the characteristics of the 2024 Mercedes more than Russell.\nThe car had slow-corner understeer. The way to counteract this was to slide the rear on entry to promote turn-in. But doing that generates rear tyre temperature, which reduces grip, a problem that increases over time. Hamilton was less able to deal with this than Russell.\nOn top of this, there is no question that, frustrated by his qualifying deficit, Hamilton would sometimes push too hard when it mattered right at the end of qualifying. That led to mistakes, which further harmed his performance.\nThe Mercedes engineers felt that there was something about the general characteristics of the current generation of cars and their ground-effect design philosophy that does not marry as well with Hamilton's style as the previous generations of cars.\nBut just because that was the case last year does not mean it will be the same this year at Ferrari. It may depend on how the car behaves.\nEqually, it's impossible to know how much of an effect psychology had - Hamilton had to do a whole year with Mercedes, the longest season in history, knowing he was leaving at the end of the season, and with his heart effectively already elsewhere.\nCertainly Vasseur believes that is too important to ignore. And Hamilton is of the same opinion.\nHamilton turned 40 in January and is the second oldest driver in F1.\nOf course, athletic performance declines over time, but Fernando Alonso - who is three and a half years older than Hamilton - insists his age is not a problem, and there is no evidence in his case that it is.\nAlonso is still performing at an extremely high level, and produced some outstanding drives last year - as he did in 2023, when again he was older than Hamilton is now.\nThere is no evidence or reason to suggest Hamilton's age will have a deleterious effect on him.\nLewis Hamilton was sixth fastest on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain at the end of February\nHamilton does not speak Italian. He is trying to learn, but it is unlikely the fact he cannot speak the language will have a serious effect on him.\nFor a start, all technical debriefs in Ferrari are conducted in English. Vasseur also does not speak Italian.\nMichael Schumacher could not speak Italian - and he won five world titles with Ferrari and is their most successful driver. Neither could Nigel Mansell. He won on his debut with Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix. He became a folk hero in his two years with the team and is still idolised as 'Il Leone' (the Lion) now.\nVasseur says: \"You know that 99% of the job is in English. It's good to speak a little bit of Italian for the mechanics and the relationship in the team but I am not sure it is crucial for the performance.\"\nCharles Leclerc finished third in the 2024 drivers' championship on 356 points. Hamiton was seventh with 223\nHamilton's partner/rival in the other Ferrari is Charles Leclerc, a 27-year-old from Monaco who has won eight grands prix and set 26 pole positions since joining the team in 2019.\nLeclerc is a Ferrari protege - he has been nurtured by the team since he was a teenager. He is richly talented and regarded as possibly the fastest driver over one lap in F1 at the moment, and his career statistics back that up.\nLeclerc does not have such a big offset between his qualifying and race success stats because he is bad at racing. He has it because his ability and raw speed has often meant he has qualified the car higher than its competitive level can sustain over a race distance.\nHamilton is also a brilliant qualifier - he holds the all-time record for pole positions. And in many ways the two drivers are very similar. Both of them have an ability to produce 'wow' performances in qualifying - laps that leave people open-mouthed, thinking, 'where did that come from?'\nHamilton might have to accept that there is a strong chance he will be out-qualified by Leclerc over the season. But he will be confident that what he probably considers his greater race-craft and experience will see him through over a season.\nHe says: \"Charles is very professional, very embedded in this team. He is very fast and I am completely aware of that. You have seen his qualifying laps.\n\"I told him in Bahrain many years ago (in 2019) he had a bright future ahead of him.  It is not going to be easy to beat him. Especially in his home. But we will work together and have some great races, I hope.\"\nHamilton cannot control whether Ferrari build him a competitive car. And if they don't, the minimum that could be considered success would be to come out on top against Leclerc.\nBut Hamilton has not gone to Ferrari to score a few podium finishes. He wants an eighth world title. He's confident he and the team can do it. And given his level of career success, and Ferrari's history in F1, nothing less than a championship will suffice.\nHe says: \"This team already has an insane legacy and are not short of championships they have won. They have a winning mentality in their DNA.\n\"The competition is fierce. It is going to be close. but I have a great team-mate, the energy I have seen from the team, there is magic here.\n\"It is going to take a lot of hard work and everyone is putting that in. But it is also about belief. Everyone in this team dreams of winning with Ferrari.\n\"I have worked with two title-winning teams before,  I know what one looks and feels like. The passion is like nothing you have ever seen. They have got everything they need to win a championship. It is just about putting the pieces together.\"\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat is at stake at under-pressure Red Bull?\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "article_text": "Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump.\nThe former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. \nIn much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"  \nCarney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nCarney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. \nThe Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. \nCarney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.\nLoud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital.  \nThe party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. \nCarney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\nThe governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country\nAt the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.\nThey have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.\nMuch of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. \nThe US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy.\nCarney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was \"attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses\". \n\"We can't let him succeed,\" he added, as the crowd booed loudly.\nHe said his government would keep tariffs on US imports \"until the Americans show us respect\".\nCanada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed.\n\"I know these are dark days,\" Carney said. \"Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. \n\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\nCarney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.\nThe US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.\n\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney. \n\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"\nShortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.\nHe warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.\nThe Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".\nThey accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.\nPoilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. \nCarney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December.\nFederal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he \"embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues\". \n\"I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election.\" \nThe Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. \nThe former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left.\nA major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years.\nHe has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US.\nDuring the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",

More news stories for BristolWatch the latest Points WestListen to the latest news for BristolMr Papastavrou repeated his calls for action that he first made to then-mayor Marvin Rees in July 2023 to move or replace the huge metal barrier installed to stop flooding in South Bristol.It covers the Pigeonhouse Stream as it enters a tunnel under Hartcliffe Way to stop debris clogging it up and creating floodwater on residential roads.Since then, it has been discovered that otters are living at the Crox Bottom nature reserve, but at least two have been killed crossing the road above.The grille is too narrow to allow the protected animals to enter the culvert across the stream that flows under the busy road, so they risk their lives by attempting to cross it.Google MapsOtters have been killed trying to cross a road in BristolIn a letter to the council Mr Papastavrou said nothing appeared to have been done since he raised the issue more than 18 months ago.A council officer explained an investigation also showed that if otters did manage to get into the culvert system, they could get trapped.The two options would be changes to the culverts or a separate \"mammal tunnel\" underneath Hartcliffe Way, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Both are expensive, but the officer said funding \"options exist\" through the West of England Nature Partnership, made up of several organisations in the region.Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "In January, days after the first-month anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime in a lightning Islamist-led rebel offensive in Syria, a group of young men - some of them armed - were gathered, checking their phones in the nearly empty interior ministry headquarters in Damascus.\nWith Bashar al-Assad gone, they had arrived from Idlib, a region in the country's north-west that for years was the only opposition-controlled province in the country.\nVirtually overnight, they had been catapulted to positions once controlled by hand-picked Assad supporters and, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, were in charge of a fractured country devastated by 13 years of civil war.\nOne of them, around 30 years old, had recently been appointed as a high-profile security official, and welcomed me to a room where any sign of the old regime had been removed. Tall and shy, the official made notes on his iPad while acknowledging that the new rulers faced enormous security challenges, including the threat coming from Assad loyalists.\nThe dismantling of the decades-old apparatus behind the oppressive machine of the Assads, such as the country's army and the ruling Baath party, meant the sacking of hundreds of thousands of people.\n\"There are Assad-affiliated people who haven't engaged with the reconciliation process,\" said the official, who requested anonymity to be able to discuss sensitive issues, citing the new authorities' call for former members of the security forces to surrender their weapons and ties to the old government.\n\"Our eyes are on everyone, but we don't want to give the impression that we're after them. That's why there haven't been massive raids.\"\nSince then the violence has escalated, particularly in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous, a stronghold of the Assad family, but clashes were relatively contained. Until Thursday.\nAs forces linked to the government carried out an operation in the countryside of Latakia province, targeting a former Assad official, they were ambushed by gunmen. \nAt least 13 members of the security forces were killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, in what a regional official described as a well-planned attack carried out by \"remnants of the Assad militias\".\nInitially limited to the Jableh area, the unrest spread more widely. Videos posted online showed heavy gunfire in different areas. The authorities sent reinforcements and, on Friday, further clashes killed more than 120 people, the Syrian Observatory said. \nIt marked the most violent day since Assad's fall and the biggest challenge yet to interim President Sharaa's transitional government and his efforts to consolidate authority.\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, a research group, former Assad regime members are likely to form the most effective insurgent cells against Syria's new rulers with the ability to coordinate attacks.\n\"[They] already have pre-existing networks that they can leverage to rapidly organize insurgent cells. These networks are military, intelligence, and political networks and criminal syndicates who were regime supporters and lost significant economic and political influence in the aftermath of Assad's fall,\" they said in a report.\nSyria's coastal areas are also the heartland of Assad's Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Its members held prominent roles in the Assad government but, with the arrival of Sunni Muslim-led rebels, lost the power and privilege they once had. They now say they are under attack and discrimination, despite Sharaa's pledges to respect different religious sects. \nOn Friday, activists said gunmen had killed dozens of male residents in Alawite areas, which will further exacerbate tensions \u2013 and possibly drive support for insurgents in their anti-government push. The Syrian Observatory said the gunmen were from the government's security forces, although this has not been verified.\nThe authorities also faced resistance from the Druze forces in the south, although a deal was reached earlier this week\nThe government in Damascus does not control the whole of Syria, where different factions - supported by different countries - exercise power over different regions. \nBut for Sharaa, the challenge goes beyond the task of trying to keep the country safe. \nAs Western suspicions over his intentions continue, his authorities are also struggling to get crippling sanctions imposed on Syria under the former regime lifted, a vital move to revive the economy of a country where nine in every 10 people are in poverty.",

        "article_text": "Men's Six Nations: Ireland v France\nVenue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday, 8 March Kick-off: 14:15 GMT\nCoverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1\nPeruse Ireland and France's line-ups for Saturday's potential Six Nations title decider and you'll find no shortage of instantly compelling head-to-head battles. \nCaelan Doris v Gregory Alldritt pits two of the world's best number eights against one another, Andrew Porter v Uini Atonio will be an engrossing scrum-time tussle, while powerhouse Irish centre Bundee Aki will meet his match in Yoram Moefana. \nBut naturally, most eyes are drawn to the battle of the scrum-halves. \nIn Antoine Dupont, France have a generational talent. A world player of the year in both the 15s and sevens codes, an Olympic gold medallist and a poster boy for his sport, Dupont has gleefully exhausted superlatives in recent years. \nHis otherworldly gifts even moved his Toulouse team-mates to refer to him as 'the Martian', Emmanuel Meafou revealed last year.\nDupont's worthy adversary on Saturday is Jamison Gibson-Park. 'Jamo' to his team-mates, he is Ireland's unflappable metronome and the frontrunner to wear nine for the British and Irish Lions in Australia this summer.\n\"Yeah, it will be interesting,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"Two fabulous players at the peak of their game. There are a number of individual battles across the teams, but that one will be pretty special.\"\nThis will not be the first time Gibson-Park and Dupont have crossed paths, of course. They have twice met in the Champions Cup, including last year's final when Dupont's Toulouse beat Gibson-Park's Leinster in extra time.  \nThey have met three times in the Six Nations, although not since 2022 (Gibson-Park was injured in 2023 while Dupont skipped last year's championship). \nThis time, the stakes are suitably sky-high.\nSix Nations: Ireland v France preview, coverage & stats\nDupont plays down Henry visit before Ireland game\nWinning 50th cap 'an incredible honour' - Bealham\nThis video can not be played\nIs Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?\nThis is a hugely important game for 28-year-old Dupont and France. For a player regarded by some as the greatest of all time, a single Six Nations title - in 2022 - is an underwhelming return. \nHe does not lack emotional ammunition heading to Dublin. In 2023, not even his herculean try-saving tackle on Mack Hansen could stop Ireland's charge to the Grand Slam. \nLater that year, France's home World Cup campaign ended in the quarter-finals. With his Olympic debut on the horizon, Dupont sat out last year's Six Nations as Les Bleus again finished second to the Irish. He led Toulouse to the Champions Cup in May, but craves more silverware at Test level.\nConsidering his Top 14 commitments are likely to rule him out of facing the All Blacks in the summer, the next couple of weeks takes on even greater significance as he leads France's bid to shift the Six Nations balance of power back to Paris. \nReassuringly for France head coach Fabien Galthie, Dupont has shone since his sevens sojourn. \nIn his first game back for Toulouse, in October, he scored a 13-minute hat-trick against Clermont. On his Test return, he captained his country to an unbeaten autumn campaign, which included a 30-29 win over New Zealand. \nFresh from scoring four tries in as many Champions Cup pool games for Toulouse, he sparkled on his Six Nations return.\nDupont's assist for Theo Attissogbe's try launched a 43-0 rout over Wales, his dead-eyed cross-kick encapsulating the decision-making and accuracy that helps set him apart.\nHe did, however, endure a rare off-night in the defeat by England. He was well shackled by the home side's defence and was not immune to the handling errors that derailed the French cause, dropping a Thomas Ramos pass when an opening try seemed a certainty.\nBut as the greats often do, he bounced back, masterfully orchestrating a French attack that scored 11 tries against Italy in Rome. \nHe even bagged himself a couple, his first Six Nations tries since the Grand Slam-clinching win over England in 2022. \nFrance missed Dupont last year, but he has been at the centre of this year's title bid, his eight direct try involvements (two tries, six assists) bettered only by his team-mate Louis Bielle-Biarrey (four tries, five assists). \nSignificantly, Romain Ntamack returns from suspension to partner Toulouse team-mate Dupont at half-back in Dublin. They started all five games of France's 2022 Grand Slam triumph together, but only one since the 2023 World Cup because of Ntamack's injuries and Dupont's sevens commitments.\nWhile Dupont is a global superstar, Gibson-Park prefers to stay away from the spotlight. Unfortunately for him, he is too good to remain in the background.  \nIt hasn't always been this way.\nAfter giving up on representing New Zealand, Gibson-Park moved to Leinster from the Hurricanes in 2016. He qualified for Ireland under the residency rule in 2019 but was left out of Joe Schmidt's World Cup squad. \nHe had to bide his time at Leinster, too, behind Luke McGrath, who started the 2018 and 2019 Champions Cup finals.\nIreland coach Andy Farrell, however, recognised his potential, handing him his Test debut in October 2020. \nHe shone in the autumn wins over Japan and New Zealand a year later, broke up Ireland's iconic Johnny Sexton-Conor Murray partnership and has not looked back, rarely being overlooked when fit.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT\nHaving missed last summer's Test series in South Africa through injury, Gibson-Park has elevated his game. In November's defeat by New Zealand, he was one of a select few in green who showed up, and was key in the victories over Argentina and Australia.\nHe has been even better in the Six Nations, delivering a series of game-changing moments for Ireland in recent weeks. \nIn his player-of-the-match display against England, he scored a crucial try to jolt Ireland out of a sluggish start, brilliantly side-stepping Freddie Steward after James Lowe had shrugged off Alex Mitchell. \nHe was arguably even better as Ireland powered past Scotland in Murrayfield. \nHis superb, try-saving tackle on Blair Kinghorn - after sprinting more than half the length of the field - demonstrated his defensive awareness, speed and ability to read the play as he stopped the hosts cutting Ireland's lead to two points.\nIn Cardiff - where he again won player of the match - he showed how his kicking helps Ireland open teams up. With Ireland trailing Wales 18-13 in the second half, it was his pinpoint cross-kick that allowed Lowe to palm the ball into Jamie Osborne's path for a crucial try.\nAlongside Lowe and Sam Prendergast, Gibson-Park has been at the forefront of Ireland's ramped-up kicking game this year. He recently said he \"couldn't kick snow off a rope\" when he arrived at Leinster in 2016, so he has turned weakness into strength.\nDupont came out on top when he last faced Gibson-Park in the 2024 Investec Champions Cup final \nGibson-Park is softly spoken in front of the media but his leadership should not be overlooked, either. \nAfter Sexton's retirement, he has helped guide untested fly-halves Jack Crowley and Prendergast through their debut Six Nations campaigns.  \nTo win in Dublin and take control of the championship, both sides need every facet operating with optimum efficiency. \nBut much will hinge on how the nines fare. Considering what they have produced in recent weeks, they are poised to take centre stage on Saturday. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "Syria's leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has called for peace after days of clashes where Syrian security forces allegedly killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite religious minority.\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) - which monitors fighting in Syria - said about 745 civilians were killed in 30 \"massacres\" targeting Alawites on the west coast on Friday and Saturday. \nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify the death toll of the escalating violence, believed to be the worst since the fall of the Assad regime.\nPresident Sharaa said: \"We must preserve national unity and civil peace as much as possible and... we will be able to live together in this country.\"\nThe number of fighters killed in the past four days brings the total death toll to more than 1,000 people, says the Syrian Observatory. This included about 125 fighters linked to the new Islamist-led government and 148 pro-Assad fighters.\nReuters news agency reported sources in the new Syrian government saying at least 200 of the fighters had been killed.\nSpeaking from a mosque in the capital, Damascus, on Sunday, the interim president said: \"What is currently happening in Syria is within the expected challenges.\"\nHe also announced in a statement that he had launched an investigation into the violence which would \"identify those responsible\" and refer the perpetrators to court. \nHe did not comment directly on accusations that atrocities were being committed by his supporters in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous.\nIn a later update on Telegram, the presidency announced the creation of a new independent committee to investigate and identify the perpetrators behind the attacks.\nOn Sunday, Syrian media reported that fighting between government forces and Assad loyalists had also broken at a gas power plant in Banias, a city about halfway between Latakia and Tartous.\nThe violence of recent days has been sparked after ambushes on government forces on Thursday. A Syrian defence ministry spokesman described it to the Sana state news agency as \"treacherous attacks\" against security personnel.\nIt has since escalated into a wave of clashes between Assad loyalists and government forces.\nHundreds of Syrians gathered in Damascus to protest against the deadly violence in the country. Demonstrators congregated in Marjeh Square - also known as Martyrs' Square - with placards on Sunday.\nAmid the fighting, hundreds of civilians living along the Mediterranean coast have fled their homes. The provinces of Latakia and Tartous were former heartlands of deposed president Bashar al-Assad, who also belongs to the Alawite minority.\nAlawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni Muslim.\nThe violence has left the Alawite community in \"a state of horror\", an activist in Latakia told the BBC on Friday.\nLarge crowds sought refuge at a Russian military base at Hmeimim in Latakia, according to the Reuters news agency. \nVideo footage shared by Reuters showed dozens of people chanting \"people want Russian protection\" outside the base.\nMeanwhile, local media reported dozens of families had also fled to neighbouring Lebanon.\nThe UN's special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said he was \"deeply alarmed\" by \"very troubling reports of civilian casualties\" in Syria's coastal areas. \nHe called on all sides to refrain from actions which could \"destabilise\" the country and jeopardise a \"credible and inclusive political transition\".\nSimilarly, the UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk called the reports \"extremely disturbing\", adding the need for \"prompt, transparent and impartial investigations\" into all the violations.\nIran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, described the killings of Alawites in Latakia and Tartous as \"systematic\" and \"extremely dangerous\", and accused Syria's interim government of failing to control the crisis. \n\"It was expected that after the fall of the Assad government, Syria would face a difficult transition,\" Amani said. \"But the scale of violence now unfolding is unprecedented and deeply troubling.\"\nIran's government was aligned with Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, which was toppled last December. Assad was ousted after decades of repressive and brutal rule by his family and an almost 14-year-long civil war.",

        "article_text": "There's a secret side of YouTube, just beyond the guiding hand of the algorithm \u2013 and it\u2019s nothing like what you know. The vast majority of YouTube's estimated 14.8 billion videos have almost never been seen. Until now.\nThis year marks YouTube's 20th birthday. From its humble beginnings as a venue for amateurs, today YouTube is such a behemoth that the company calls itself the new Hollywood. YouTube is the world's number one TV streaming service, where users clock billions of hours of watching every day. Leading YouTubers regularly outperform big-name studios. For comparison, an estimated 823 million cinema tickets were sold across all of the US and Canada in 2024. Meanwhile, MrBeast's most successful video alone racked up 762 million views, about one watch for every 10 people on earth. \u00a0\nThat's the vision of YouTube the company promotes \u2013 slick, professional, entertaining and loud \u2013 but from one perspective, it's all a fa\u00e7ade.\nThrough another lens, the essence of YouTube is more like this video from 2020. Before I watched, it had only been seen twice. A man points the camera out of his bedroom window as a flurry breaks out in the dead of winter. \"Here it is,\" he says. \"The falling snow.\" The sound of a TV plays in the background. A bird lands on a nearby fence. 19 minutes go by. Nothing happens.\n\"The conversations we're having about YouTube are based on an impoverished view of what the platform really is,\" says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US. \"When we just focus on what's popular, we miss how the vast majority of people actually use YouTube as uploaders, and overlooking the role it plays in our society.\"\nI spent the last month dipping into one of the first truly random samples of YouTube ever collected outside the company. I saw a side of the internet that sometimes feels lost, one full of pure, unvarnished self-expression. It's an entire world that YouTube's all-seeing algorithm won't show you.\n\"YouTube isn't just a vehicle for professionals,\" McGrady says. \"We rely on it as the default video arm of the internet. YouTube is infrastructure. It's a critical tool that regular people use to communicate.\"\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our stories on:\n\u2022\u00a0YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 The YouTube videos that changed the way we think about ourselves\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\nTo unveil this side of YouTube, McGrady and his colleagues built a tool that dials videos at random. The scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs before it collected a big enough sample for real scientific analysis. Among the findings the researchers estimate that the median video has been watched just 41 times; posts with more than 130 views are actually in the top third of the service's most popular content. In other words, the vast majority of YouTube is practically invisible.\nMost of these videos aren't meant for us to see. They exist because people need a digital attic to store their memories. It's an internet unshaped by the pressures of clicks and algorithms \u2013 a glimpse into a place where content doesn't have to perform, where it can simply exist.\nTwelve years ago, a woman from the US named Emily posted a YouTube video called \"sw33t tats\". I learned it's even older than that, recorded around 2008. In the video, Emily, who asked to withhold her full name, sits in her college dorm room. She pries her mouth open as her younger sister brings a marker to the inside of Emily's lower lip.\n\"Stop moving!\", her sister yells as she starts to write, the girls barely able to control their laughter. Emily holds her lip open to the camera, and her sister does the same, revealing a sweet tat of her own. But the footage is blurry; whatever these fake tattoos said is lost to time.\nEmily, now 34 and living in New York City, forgot this video existed until I asked her about it. \"I don't even remember why I uploaded this,\" she says. \"I think wanted to send it to my sister, but I also I had to free up space on my hard drive. I just needed a place to put it. I don't know, it's funny and weird. I'm glad it's still here.\"\n\"We tend to assume the reason to use social media is to try to be an influencer, either you're Joe Rogan or you're a failure. But that's the wrong way to think about it,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, who leads the YouTube research as the director of the University of Massachusetts' Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure.\nYouTube tells the BBC it's incorrect to say the platform doesn't let you see videos with low views or content from small channels. The algorithm's job is to help people find the videos they want to watch and that will give them value, YouTube says, and sometimes that does include videos with a small number of views.\n\"The magic of YouTube is that whether a video has 60 views or six million, people are able to find community, learn a new skill, be entertained, or share their voice with the world,\" says Boot Bullwinkle, a YouTube spokesperson. \"Every channel starts from the same blank slate, from which they can build an audience and grow a business.\"\nZuckerman and his colleagues weren't the first to go looking for YouTube's underbelly. Between 2009 and 2012, for instance, iPhones included a feature that let users post videos straight to YouTube with a few taps. YouTube reported that mobile uploads jumped 400% a day. Unless people added a custom title, the name for all these videos followed a standard format, which makes them easily searchable over a decade later. A few online tinkerers have explored these videos, which apparently number in the millions. One even built a custom player that cycles through them.\nWithout the algorithm's recommendations, you'll find that YouTube is a study of the everyday, Zuckerman says, people documenting small moments in their lives and using the available tools to exchange ideas.\nIn South Asia, for example, Zuckerman says YouTube and similar networks seem to function as a video messaging tool for people with low or no literacy. Most of YouTube comes from outside of the US, in fact. Zuckerman's lab has estimated that over 70% of YouTube videos are in languages other than English. You find fisherman in South America waving from a boat, or two construction workers speaking in Hindi about how much they miss home. Videos like these fall under what he calls \"friends and family\" content, where comments and interactions all come from people who seem to know the user personally.\n\"If any of these videos went viral, it would mean something went terribly wrong. That's not what most of YouTube for,\" Zuckerman says.\nMost unwatched YouTube is less entertaining than sw33t tats, which, with respect to Emily, sets a low bar. This stuff is bland enough to melt your brain. A bride gets ready for a photo shoot. A grouchy Korean man rants about politics. Six seconds of a martial arts instructor, devoid of context. Dash camera footage from a car struggling to escape a parking lot. A woman advertises a horse for sale in 2018. Endless, mundane screen recordings of video games \u2013 the University of Massachusetts Amhurst study found people playing video games seems to make up almost 20% of YouTube. \u00a0\nOccasionally, you stumble on something fun, or more often, just plain weird. Three men performatively slapping each other's rear ends to a James Brown song. A woman reviews a brand of pre-sliced bologna (it's \"not too bad\"). Or take the channel \"Space Stuff and Other Stuff\", where a kid raps about the planet Neptune and shares his condolences after Queen Elizabeth's passing. The latter falls in the \"other stuff\" category, apparently.\nSome videos are heartrending. I listened to an elderly man describe how he's living in a car on a farm, trading manual labour for a place to stay. There was a moving tribute to a departed cat from her owner, Tyler. \"Kiko didn't make it,\" he says, holding back tears. \"It's so darn quiet without her here.\" A few dozen videos I paused to watch a young ballerina float delicately across a stage, wafting back and forth in front of a hushed crowd.\n\"As researchers, we spend a lot of time with this stuff. It can be a lot like looking at people's personal snapshots,\" Zuckerman says. \"Most of it's boring, but sometimes it's poignant, even haunting. And every so often, you get something that feels incredibly revealing about how human beings communicate.\"\nBut my favourite videos by far came from Bill \"The WoofDriver\" Hellman. He's a 58-year-old working in real estate just outside of Baltimore, US. But that's not his passion. What Hellman really cares about is his dogs, and the unique way he cares for them. \"You've never seen anything like this before,\" he says in one video. I guarantee that he's right.\nHellman has built over 50 custom-made vehicles that he uses to take his four huskies out for what he calls \"urban mushing\". He uses social media to document their adventures on the trails of the eastern US. It all looks a bit like the dog sled races of the Iditarod. Except here, the dogs are usually strapped to the side of his various slow-moving contraptions, recumbent bicycles and electric dog-walking carts. By the looks of it Hellman's dogs are thrilled to participate.\nHe's posted more than 2,400 YouTube videos in the last 14 years, many of which include original rock songs. (Hellman says he's written more than 100 WoofDriver songs, in fact.) He puts in a lot of work, heading out with drones and groups of friends to document his journeys. Hellman's even paid for celebrity endorsements through the platform Cameo to promote his videos. But for all the effort, his channel often gets little traction. Many videos have views in the low double digits.\n\"I don't get a big audience a lot of the time, but that doesn't bother me. I was just so in love with how happy it made the dogs that at some point I thought 'I gotta share this',\" Hellman says. \"Maybe it'll inspire someone to take better care of their dogs, but really, I use YouTube like the cloud, so I have a place to document my adventures.\"\nYouTube doesn't pay the bills, and the WoofDriver isn't selling anything \u2013 though he's happy to give you the dimensions if you want to build your own urban dog sled. \"I just do it because of the joy it brings me,\" Hellman says.\nRandom YouTube usually doesn't look like the highly produced videos of the WoofDriver, but he's a good representation in one sense. Like Hellman's content, the majority of these unseen YouTube videos range from neutral to overwhelmingly positive.\nThe same can't be said for what rises to the top. Research suggests YouTube's algorithm amplifies negativity, reinforces stereotypes and gives users little control over the content they don't want to see. Over the years, YouTube has faced increasing criticism over concerns about hate speech, political extremism and misinformation. Along with other social media platforms, YouTube has been utilised by drug cartels and harnessed by terrorists as a tool for promotion and recruitment.\nYouTube says that the company has employed a set of community guidelines since its earliest days to establish what's allowed on the platform. The company says it has redoubled efforts to address its responsibilities. One way YouTube measures its success is through its \"violative view rate\". In 2017, for every 10,000 views on YouTube, 63-72 views came from content that violated YouTube policies, but today that number has fallen to eight to nine views, according to the company.\nYouTube says it gives users several ways to manage YouTube recommendations and search results, such as deleting your Watch History.\nWhen the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure set out to study YouTube, part of the impetus was to document how common hate speech and misinformation is on the platform. \"If you go looking for it, you'll find it,\" McGrady says, but compared to the total body of videos on YouTube it's exceedingly unusual. Still, it doesn't matter how rare a damaging video is if it gets a ton of views, McGrady says, and harmful content remains a serious issue on YouTube.\nIn recent years, Google has faced a wave of scrutiny from policy makers, with new laws and a mountain of proposed regulations \u2013 not to mention a series of antitrust cases. But when the regulatory conversation turns to the videos on YouTube themselves, the focus is almost always on content that goes viral, McGrady says.\nThis ignores the obligations YouTube should have because, according to McGrady, the company is running a piece of essential infrastructure.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022 Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\n\"The internet is deeply troubled, and we can't ignore the way tech companies are exacerbating those problems,\" McGrady says. \"What makes me hopeful is that when you find a way to look at how people are really using the web, a lot of it still feels like the early internet. It's expression, communication, connection. Fundamentally, it's a place where regular people share themselves and do wonderful things.\"\nThe YouTube we talk about \u2013 the one full of celebrities, scandals and manufactured virality \u2013 only tells part of the story. The majority exists in quiet moments, in shaky camera work and voices meant for no one in particular. \u00a0I watched hundreds of these videos. Everything one of them is public, but it's also clear that most people didn't upload this content for strangers. It was like being let in on a secret, a sprawling, uncurated documentary of human life. But watching it also felt like work compared to the doomscroll-inducing entertainment you get from the algorithm. Eventually, I closed my tabs and headed back to the YouTube homepage, back to the polished world of the corporate internet.\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

But can we do everything in our power to close the gap? I thought we could, I just didn't think we would get in as quickly.\n\"So, the next challenge is to show consistency.\"\nCoventry last won eight games from nine in the 1969-70 season\nCoventry are on their best run in the league for 55 years in terms of sheer points accumulation over a nine-game period.\nTheir recent tally of eight wins in nine matches is their most since they did the same between November 1969 and February 1970, in what was then Division One (now the Premier League).\nThe Sky Blues strung together 14 games without defeat in 2020 (W11 D3) on the way to winning League One under Robins, also between January and March, but didn't exceed 24 points in any nine consecutive outings despite that streak.\nSimilarly, Lampard has never been on such a run during his managerial career, even when he took Derby to the Championship play-offs in 2018-19, nor with Chelsea the following campaign when the Blues finished fourth in the top flight.\nCoventry have scored more regularly and conceded less frequently under Lampard compared to Robins\nThe Lampard effect is clear to see, with Coventry improving on every metric in the Championship compared to Robins this season.\nThey have scored more goals per game under Lampard (1.50) than Robins (1.28) and also conceded fewer in each match (1.05 compared to 1.35).\n\"When you get in, you try and analyse the problems quickly and we were conceding too many goals,\" Lampard said.\n\"We weren't compact enough, we weren't aggressive enough, so we tried to really prioritise our off the ball work.\n\"The players have done it because they've bought into everything we've tried to say.\n\"I have to say, this group of players, the humility, the application of them is absolutely amazing.\"\nAmong the standout performers who have improved under Lampard are creative midfielder Jack Rudoni and winger Ephron Mason-Clark.\nNo other Coventry player has had more goal contributions than Rudoni since Lampard arrived, scoring three goals and providing six assists, while Mason-Clark has netted four times and laid on another four in that time.\nStriker Ellis Simms has also seen an upturn in performances, putting opposing defenders under more pressure than previously, and his output has increased, grabbing four goals and an assist, compared to just two goals under Robins.\nThat has perhaps stemmed from Simms having to fight for his spot with Lampard favouring striker Norman Bassette in the early stages of his Coventry tenure.\nLampard hasn't been afraid to tweak the line-up and shape either, shifting almost seamlessly between 3-5-2 and 4-3-2-1, whether that be with Simms and Brandon Thomas-Asante up top or Simms on his own.\nTatsuhiro Sakamoto has provided further attacking threat from midfield with three goals and an assist and the return of top goalscorer Haji Wright from injury could yet still prove timely.\n\"We've had challenges, had some injuries, had to change shape, be adaptable,\" Lampard said.\n\"Now we're getting players fit so now we've got this bit more competitive nature to the squad where we can make changes in game.\"\nIf the Sky Blues continue at the same two points per game ratio they've achieved since Lampard took charge, they will end the season on 75 points.\nThat tally would have seen them finish in a play-off spot in 21 of the previous 23 Championship campaigns.\n\"I think we have to feed off our position in a positive way,\" Lampard said.\n\"Our run-in is a challenge. We absolutely have to go game by game. We back ourselves now, we know we can compete, we've shown that in the last period.\n\"But we cannot take our foot off the pedal in terms of our work and our prep and everything we do, so I'm looking forward to seeing if we can keep this form and momentum because we will take some hits in those 11 games.\n\"We've had a really good run but it won't look that way all the time. I'm a realist, I understand. Can we bounce back from those quickly? That will be the test of where we are.\"\nCoventry have lost just once at the CBS Arena in the Championship since Lampard arrived (W6 D1)\nEven in their wildest dreams, Sky Blues fans couldn't have imagined things would be going as well as they are, right here, right now, under Frank Lampard.\nTo say his appointment was greeted by scepticism in some quarters would be something of an understatement, especially given whose shoes he was recruited to fill, and at one point, merely staying in the division would have been regarded as an achievement, never mind challenging for a play-off spot.\nThere have been some bumps in the road; most notably taking an early lead, but then having the floor wiped with them by Portsmouth, and leading 1-0 at Norwich, going into four minutes of added time, only to contrive to lose 2-1.\nHowever, the positives far outweigh the negatives to this point, and some long-standing demons have been exorcised as well - winning in Swansea for the first time in 75 years, and beating Preston in a league match, which hadn't happened since September 2007.\nHow's he done it? To this untrained eye, by instilling much-needed belief in the squad, working extremely hard, both on and off the pitch, collectively and individually with players to extract every last drop of positivity from them, and that approach is reaping huge dividends at the moment.\nAn outstanding example of that occurred just last weekend, at Oxford, when they took the lead twice, were pegged back twice, had a penalty saved at 2-2, and yet still went on to win 3-2.\nTrust me, as someone that's watched every game so far, that would not have happened earlier in the season.\nCredit must go to Lampard's coaches Joe Edwards and Chris Jones too - that's clearly a dynamic that works extremely well, and speaking on behalf of all City fans, long may it continue.\nCoventry have picked up more points than any other Championship side in the past nine games\n\"It's going quite well isn't it,\" Coventry fan Sam Riman told the BBC's Sky Blues fancast.\n\"Earlier this year, I remember saying, 'it's a bit of a write-off season, we'll just see what Lampard can do, see what that brings in the summer and go again next year'.\n\"And now here we are, fifth in the Championship table.\"\nLampard has made a habit of applauding the Coventry fans after each game and fist-pumping to the crowd when they win and BBC CWR sports editor Gurney says it \"shows he's got a bond with the fans by doing that\".\n\"Going back to the end of November when he first came in, he knew the previous incumbent was very popular with the fanbase and he needed to build that relationship pretty quickly and he's done that,\" Gurney said.\nSupporter Adam Sloman said the relationship Lampard has built with the fans was \"arguably the hardest part of the job\".\n\"He was very quick to say about the great work done by his predecessor but he was very careful to make sure he got the fans on side,\" Sloman said.\nLampard reiterated he's \"under no illusions\" how difficult the final two months of the campaign will be and says Coventry must \"guard against any form of complacency to be a top team\".\n\"Some things have come together nicely, it's a lovely period of time because we're winning games,\" he added.\n\"The next challenge is the bigger one. We've got the run-in and the minute you go 'we've cracked it', this game, this Championship will smack you in the face.\n\"There's a long way to make the play-offs, to get through the play-offs to make the final. But if we can do that, it would be huge for this city. \n\"It would be amazing.\"\nYou can watch Frank Lampard's interview with Football Focus on BBC One at 12:00 GMT on Saturday, 8 March.",

        "article_text": "In announcing the decision to postpone some tariffs on Mexico for another month, US President Donald Trump was at pains to praise his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\"I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum\", he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. \"Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border.\"\nThe comments were in stark contrast to the kind of language he has used for the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, who he continues to refer to as \"Governor Trudeau\", while calling Canada \"the 51st State\". \nThe war of words \u2013 if not yet trade \u2013 continues between Canada and the Trump administration with Prime Minister Trudeau calling the entire tariffs policy \"dumb\" and the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, calling him a \"numbskull\" in return.\nThe difference in tone between the US neighbour to the north and the one to the south could hardly be more striking.\nSome, particularly in Claudia Sheinbaum's camp, see it as evidence of her deft handling of an unpredictable leader in the White House, one who has made several bold statements of intent, only for them to be rolled back or watered down.\nCertainly, President Sheinbaum has delivered a singular message from the start: Mexicans should \"remain calm\" over Trump, she has said, insisting that \"cooler heads will prevail.\"\nIn that sense, it has been so far, so good for the Mexican leader.\nTwice, now, in two months she has managed to stave off the imposition of sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexican goods through a last-minute phone call to President Trump \u2013 even though he said there was \"no room\" for negotiation. \nIt is testament to her diplomacy that Trump seems to genuinely appreciate her tone, clarity and overall demeanour in their interactions.\nShe has refused to accept publicly that Mexico hasn't done enough on either of the main border issues on which Trump is demanding action from his neighbours: fentanyl trafficking and undocumented immigration north.\nShe began Thursday's morning press briefing by referring to new figures from the US Customs and Border Protection agency which show seizures of fentanyl have dropped to 263 kilos, their lowest levels in 3 years. It represents a 75% drop in the last six months of her presidency.\nWhen tariffs were avoided in February, Sheinbaum agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border. \nHer administration has also extradited (although they prefer the word \"expelled\") 29 drug cartel figures to the US to face trial on charges from murder to money laundering, including a top drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been wanted by the US authorities since the mid-1980s.\nThose may well have been the measures Trump was referring to when he said the two countries were \"working hard, together\" on border security.\nFurthermore, she has often thrown the ball back in the US president's direction. \nWhere do the guns which arm the cartels come from, she asks rhetorically, openly calling for the US to do more to curb the flow of weapons south and tackle its demand for illegal drugs. The drugs may come from Latin America, she points out, but the market for their consumption is overwhelmingly in the US.\nEven when the Trump administration recently designated six Mexican cartels as \"foreign terrorist organisations\", it seemed to strengthen her hand.\nThat's because her administration is currently embroiled in a legal battle with US gun manufacturers over negligence. If US weapons-makers have allowed their products to reach terrorists rather than mere criminals, Mexico could expand its lawsuit, she said, to include a new charge of \"complicity\" with terror groups.\nAnd yet while President Sheinbaum is enjoying a strong start to her presidency \u2013 both domestically and in the eyes of the world \u2013 for her handling of Trump, it is worth stressing that these are early days in their bilateral relationship.\n\"I think she has played the hand she has been dealt pretty well\", said Mexican economist, Valeria Moy. \"I'm not sure it's time for celebration just yet. But I think she has done what she can in the face of the threat of tariffs. It makes little sense for either of side to enter into a trade war.\"\nThe key to Sheinbaum's success seems to have been in refusing to back down on unreasonable requests or matters of real importance, while similarly not appearing subservient or acquiescent to the White House's demands. \nThat is not an easy path to tread.\nOn some questions \u2013 the Gulf of Mexico being renamed by Trump as the Gulf of America, for example \u2013 she can afford to remain above the fray knowing that most people around the world are unlikely to adopt his preferred terminology. \nOn others, particularly tariffs, the stakes are considerably higher; there's a danger that the constant back-and-forth and instability on the issue could push the Mexican economy into recession.\nThe Mexican peso weakened again during this latest episode and, although Sheinbaum claims the country's economy is strong, the markets would clearly prefer a more reliable and solid relationship with the US. Mexico remains the US's biggest trading partner, after all.\nWhen I spoke to President Sheinbaum on the campaign trail last year, shortly before she made history by becoming Mexico's first woman president, she said she would have no problem working with a second Trump presidency and that she would always \"defend\" what was right for Mexicans \u2013 including the millions who reside in the US.\n\"We must always defend our country and our sovereignty,\" she told me.\nWith so much bluster between these three neighbours in recent days, it is easy to forget that the Trump presidency is still only six weeks old.\nThe new relationship with the White House has a long way to go, with the USMCA trade agreement to be renegotiated next year. But certainly, amid all the political theatre, Claudia Sheinbaum will be more pleased than Justin Trudeau with how it has started.",

        "article_text": "You would never say Arsenal and Manchester United are having similar seasons, but Sunday's Premier League stalemate at Old Trafford was a reminder that they have something in common - a problem to solve up front.\nWhile the Gunners' attacking flaw appears to be a glaring one, in that they have played much of this campaign without a recognised centre-forward, United do have some strikers, but their regular failure to find the net has left people questioning whether they are good enough to help Ruben Amorim's side climb the table.\nWayne Rooney had sympathy for Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund when he analysed their display for his former club on Match of the Day 2, but felt Arsenal's issue again proved costly after watching them lose even more ground to Liverpool in an increasingly one-sided title race.\n\"I always feel the teams with the best number nines have the best chance of winning things,\" United's all-time record goalscorer, who won five Premier League titles, told BBC Sport.\n\"Liverpool are probably an exception to that, with the way they rotate the player they use through the middle, rather than having a regular number nine that the team is built around.\n\"The number nine is still so important for them, though. Mohamed Salah, cutting in from wide areas, is their main goalscorer but, whether it is Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota or Darwin Nunez in the centre, they all chip in with a good amount of goals.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHojlund needs more confidence to start scoring  - Rooney\nLiverpool have scored 17 more league goals than Arsenal this season - a simple statistic but a telling one, even taking into account the leaders have played one game more.\nWith Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz out for the season and another key attacker, Bukayo Saka, absent, it has been left to midfielder Mikel Merino to fill in as an emergency striker for Mikel Arteta's side in the way he did against United, this time with little effect.\nWhile the Gunners controlled the game for long periods, goalscorer Declan Rice conceded afterwards that they did not have the cutting edge needed. Rooney felt a specialist finisher was what they were missing.\n\"A proper number nine - a forward who has played there his whole life - brings  something different to any team,\" he explained.\n\"I am talking about that natural goalscoring instinct, which a player who is trying to learn the position probably doesn't have.\n\"A midfielder playing forward like Merino can get hold of the ball and bring others into play, but what a goalscorer brings is that selfishness of wanting to be in the penalty area to finish chances.\n\"As we saw on Sunday, Rice was trying to help Arsenal to fill that position, as the player who was always making forward runs and arriving in the box. He did really well in that advanced role, but he cannot always be there.\"\nDeclan Rice made six touches inside the United box, along with Jurrien Timber the joint-most by an Arsenal player\nMerino may be a midfielder, but he has scored three Premier League goals this year. Hojlund and Zirkzee have none.\nThose numbers may not suggest the answer to United's goalscoring problems lies within their current squad, but Rooney argues that any striker would find it difficult playing up front for United at present.\n\"Before they scored at the end of the first half, United had managed one shot at goal and none on target,\" Rooney said.\n\"Their problem was their lack of movement in midfield, because they could not make the passes to get up the pitch. Instead, they were forced to play balls up to Zirkzee and it was very hard for him to do anything with them.\n\"The best centre-halves, like Arsenal's are, force you under the ball in that situation or nick balls off you.\n\"If the ball is getting chipped in to you around the halfway line, which is what Zirkzee was getting, and you haven't got the support in and around you, then it is very difficult and you have to work extremely hard.\n\"Firstly, you are fighting the centre-half and holding him off you. Then you've got to get the ball under control and try to bring someone into play.\n\"If the quality of the pass up to you is not great, especially when it is coming to you around your neck like some of United's passes were, it is even harder.\n\"A lot of the time Zirkzee was getting given a 50-50 ball, the kind where you have to work wonders to win it. Ideally, what you want is your team to make a few passes and play out of the pressure, then as the striker you are getting the ball to feet, which makes it a lot easier, and you are closer to the opposition goal too.\n\"For a centre-half, if you are facing your own goal and in your own half, then it makes their job a lot easier, but if you are higher up the pitch the striker has lots more options. The defender cannot be all over you because they are afraid of giving free-kicks away.\n\"What United needed to do was get some control of the game, and get on the ball. Then the striker can make the little five yard bursts to get behind the defence, which give you a better chance of scoring.\"\nWhile Zirkzee had few sights of goal in the first half, replacement Hojlund got a couple of good opportunities to end his drought when the game opened up late on - but was unable to take them.\n\"There was one chance where his shot was blocked after he had shown fantastic movement to get to the near post,\" Rooney said.\n\"He goes once, he checks back, goes again, got across Gabriel and got a good contact on his shot, so he had done everything right. It is only a great block that stops the goal.\"\nHojlund's run to the near post - his first-time shot was blocked and flew wide\n\"The one that will be highlighted, though, is the one where Rice gets back and tackles him after the ball breaks for him in the area, and that was purely down to a lack of confidence.\n\"You see Hojlund take a touch and then he is looking up to see where he wants to put his shot when he doesn't have the time for that.\n\"That's the kind of scenario where, as a striker, if you are scoring goals you don't even have to look up - you know where the goal is.\n\"To me that really showed how much he needs a goal right now, but all he can do is keep working.\n\"I've got faith in him. He's a good player who works hard, which is really important. He needs that bit of luck as well, but once he gets a break then more goals will follow.\n\"As a striker for Manchester United, when you are not scoring goals there is a lot of pressure and a lot of people questioning if you can do it for United.\n\"The best thing for Hojlund to do is simplify it. Making runs into the penalty box is as easy at it comes. There was an attack late on against Arsenal I highlighted on Match of the Day 2 where Alejandro Garnacho is about to put in a cross and Hojlund needs to have that desire to get in the box.\n\"He goes to go, then for some reason he stops. If he carries on his run then he is in the right place around about the six yard box to get a tap-in for the winner when Bruno Fernandes' shot is saved.\n\"When you are short of confidence you have got to make sure you make it into the penalty area and put yourself in a position where you can score, so that is something he can improve on.\nThe arrow shows the run Rooney thinks Hojlund should have made\n\"We are still waiting to see Hojlund find his feet for United, but it's important to point out that the whole team have not been at their best.\n\"I feel for him from that point of view because, nine times out of 10, forwards rely on their team-mates for service.\n\"United have not been playing well or creating enough chances, so he has not been in a team dominating possession, sliding balls in behind the defence or putting balls into the box.\"\nOne way for both clubs to solve their attacking issues will be in the summer transfer window, but it is not just United and Arsenal who seemingly need a new striker.\nChelsea are also being linked with a string of number nines, and even Liverpool are supposedly lining up a goalscorer as a potential replacement for Salah, whose contract is up at the end of the season.\nIpswich's Liam Delap is reportedly being targeted by several clubs. The 22-year-old is a player Rooney considered signing in the past, when he was a teenager available on loan from Manchester City in 2021.\n\"Liam is someone I looked at for the clubs I've been at, and he is a fantastic player,\" Rooney said. \"He is a powerful lad and has a great physique to play the role he does.\n\"He probably surprised a few people by going to Ipswich, but he has scored some great goals.\n\"Ipswich are struggling in the league, so it is not always that easy for him, and I have seen a few games where he can get frustrated because he is not getting the service - exactly the problem I was talking about with United.\n\"But Liam has a massive amount of potential and I am sure he is going to have a fantastic career.\n\"I can see why the top clubs are being linked with him, but they are all going for the same players, because there is a shortage of number nines.\"\nLiam Delap has scored 10 Premier League goals this season\nIt does seem like the same strikers are on the summer shortlist of several clubs.\nArsenal failed with a January bid for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, while Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta has been talked about as a target for the Gunners and United.\n\"Mateta is a big, strong lad who scores a lot of goals,\" Rooney said. \"From watching Arsenal over the past few games in the Premier League, they have put a lot of balls into the box without having anyone to get on the end of them. I am sure he would help from that point of view.\"\nAs well as finding someone who suits your playing style, availability is another obstacle.\nNewcastle's Alexander Isak is often viewed as the answer to Arsenal's lack of strikers, and he has also been touted as a potential Salah replacement.\n\"Isak would fit into any team,\" Rooney said. \"He has been fantastic over the past couple of years and scored a lot of goals. His link-up play and movement is brilliant too.\n\"You look at any team in the Premier League, and whether it is United and Arsenal or Liverpool then he would improve them, but I also think it will be very difficult to get him out of Newcastle. Why would they sell him?\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump called a meeting of his cabinet secretaries on Thursday to discuss Elon Musk and his efforts to slash government spending and personnel numbers.\nIt turned heated, according to media reports.\nMusk accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of failing to cut enough staff at the state department, reports the New York Times.\nThe tech mogul told Rubio he was \"good on TV\", according to the newspaper, pointedly skipping any praise of his work as America's top diplomat.\nThe billionaire also clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over whether Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) task force had tried to lay off air traffic controllers who were already in short supply in the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the New York Times.\nDuffy's department has been under scrutiny after two US airline crashes since Trump took office in January. \nAfter listening to the back-and-forth, the Republican president reportedly intervened to make clear he still supported Doge, but from now on cabinet secretaries would be in charge and the Musk team would only advise. \nA state department spokeswoman told the newspaper Rubio felt the cabinet meeting was an \"open and productive discussion\". The White House has not responded to BBC requests for further comment.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office after the meeting, Trump said cabinet members should decide who to cut, but if they didn't, Musk would do the job.\n\"I had a meeting, and I said I want the cabinet members to go first\", Trump said. \"And if they can cut it's better, if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\"\nThe hastily planned gathering could provide evidence that the president has decided to curtail the sweeping power the SpaceX and Tesla boss and his Doge cost-cutting initiative have commanded in the early weeks of his administration.\nTrump first commented on the substance of Thursday's meeting, which was disclosed only in after-the-fact media reports, through a post that evening on his social media site, Truth Social.\nHe said that he had instructed his secretaries to work with Doge on \"cost-cutting measures\".\n\"As the secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,\" he wrote, adding that they should use a \"scalpel\" not a \"hatchet\".\nJust a few weeks ago, Musk wielded a shiny chainsaw at a conservative conference \u2013 a visible symbol of aggressive attempts to slash government spending that have angered Democrats and concerned some officials in the Trump administration.\nMusk's team had sent multiple emails from an official government account to millions of federal workers, encouraging them to accept months of advance pay in exchange for their resignations.\nFederal workers were instructed to provide accounts of their weekly accomplishments or risk firing \u2013 a request some agencies instructed their employees to ignore.\nDoge also ordered the dismissal of many newly hired government employees who, because of their \"probationary\" status, did not have full civil service protections. \nSome government agencies have since rescinded these orders because employees deemed essential, such as those who oversee nuclear weapon security, had been affected.\nDuring an Oval Office event on Friday, Trump responded to questions about the cabinet meeting \u2013 and reports of its heated exchanges. He insisted there was \"no clash\". He praised both Rubio and Musk and said the two got along \"great\".\nTrump's Thursday Truth Social post, however, appears to give department heads more authority to push back against Musk. \nIt also may be an attempt to insulate the Trump administration from lawsuits that allege Musk is wielding too much power for someone who, unlike cabinet secretaries, is not subject to Senate review and confirmation.\nSeveral federal judges overseeing these cases have already expressed concern about Musk's authority \u2013 concerns that may be further fuelled by Trump's comments during his address to Congress on Tuesday that the billionaire was, in fact, the man in charge of Doge.\nMusk and Trump have formed a formidable partnership so far \u2013 as the richest man in the world and the most powerful politician in America. Washington has been rife with speculation for months about whether that partnership could ultimately fracture.\nThose predictions, however, have usually been followed by renewed signs of comity between the two men. \nOn Friday night, Musk was seen boarding Air Force One with the president for a flight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend.\nThe cabinet room dust-up may be the first crack in the foundation \u2013 but there is plenty of evidence that Trump still supports Musk's broader efforts and goals, even if he might prefer he use a scalpel in the days ahead, not a chainsaw.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Subscribers to Joshuanette Francis's YouTube channel \u2013 set up to document her journey after being diagnosed with osteoarthritis at just 24 \u2013 did not see the tears.\nNeither were they privy to the days when she tackled the most acute personal struggles, alone behind closed doors. \nAfter being told she could lose the ability to walk by age 40, Joshuanette was determined to embrace life, hiking every nature trail in her native Antigua and visiting each one of the Caribbean island's touted 365 beaches while she still could.\nConsistently upbeat and smiling in her videos and in public, her private tears were amplified when she lost her job as a restaurant supervisor - because of her condition, she says - followed by her mortgage and her dream of building her own home.\nSix years on, the young mother's sunny persona is the one she uses to fight her public battle: championing the rights of others living with a disability in a country where inequity is rife and crucial resources are in short supply.\nShe channels her energy into a pioneering non-profit she founded in 2023, Good Humans 268, which strives for a brighter future for people with physical challenges. \n\n\"Arthritis has changed my life so much, I can only imagine what it must be like for someone with a major disability,\" Joshuanette tells the BBC.\nOsteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness, typically affects older people, but can strike at any age.\n\"I couldn't believe it when I was diagnosed. My biggest fear was, what happens to life now?\" Joshuanette says.\nGood Humans' far-reaching work ranges from pushing for the establishment of an equal rights tribunal to preside over purported discriminatory practices, to a recycling programme that in turn employs local residents with disabilities.\nThe latter has already been implemented in more than 80 local schools, diverting about a million bottles and cans from the national dump site. Eight people have been hired to sort and process, and sometimes repurpose, the waste.\nGood Humans has also launched a nationwide educational programme to encourage more residents to recycle, something Kelisha Pigott was employed to assist with.\nShe says working with the organisation has been life-changing.\n\"There are a lot of people with disabilities out there who have no one to turn to. Joshuanette has moulded me to believe in myself more. It's because of her that I took the chance to apply for university and got in,\" Kelisha enthuses.\nShe hopes her online degree in tourism management will help her eventually merge her small travel company with Good Humans to create additional job opportunities.\n\"Change starts with us. I was amazed to see how much plastic we diverted from landfill in a short space of time; imagine if everyone did it,\" she says.\nThere have been some smaller triumphs too. Like the case of the 10-year-old girl who for several years couldn't use the toilet at school unassisted because of the lack of wheelchair-friendly facilities. That indignity went largely overlooked until Joshuanette took it on as a personal endeavour, leading to the creation of an accessible bathroom.\n\"We must shift the way we do things. People with disabilities must be able to do the same things everyone else can,\" Joshuanette says passionately. \"I'm so excited by what I know Good Humans can achieve.\"\nPlans include rolling out the recycling scheme to private households and ultimately creating a purpose-built centre to consolidate the group's diverse work.\nStill, she's aware of the challenges ahead. Even a stroll around the capital, St John's, is fraught with hazards for many with an impairment, thanks to omnipresent open gutters, crudely covered drains and cracked paving.\n\"Accessibility is a serious concern,\" says Bernard Warner, head of the country's disability association. \"For a start, there's a lack of access to assistive devices to help people live more meaningfully.\"\nBoth Bernard's group and Good Humans have been calling for legislation passed in 2017, which seeks to protect the rights of those with disabilities, to be enforced. An equal rights tribunal was a key part of the act, but has never been created.\n\"There's a lot of discrimination; people are treated with indifference or turned away from employment opportunities,\" Bernard says. \"And due to poverty, most don't have money to hire lawyers.\"\nBernard lost his right leg when his motorbike was struck by a drunk driver in 1996. Despite a lengthy court case, which ruled in his favour, he has never received compensation.\n\"After years of torment, I now rally for a better society,\" he explains. \"We have to alter our mindset with how we view people with disabilities. We've been leaving them out for too long. Even now, I see high-rise buildings going up with no disability access,\" he adds.\nKelly Hedges, principal of the Victory Centre for children with special needs, agrees. Her school currently has 27 students aged five to 18.\n\"The challenge is, when students leave us as young adults, where do they go? People are still wary about hiring people with special needs or disabilities. Unless they have personal connections or can go to work with a parent, they generally just stay home,\" she says.\nThe Victory Centre is among the schools to have joined Good Humans' recycling scheme.\n\"As Good Humans becomes bigger and needs more staff, hopefully our children can segue into positions there, become contributing members of society and live more independently,\" Kelly adds.\nJoshuanette believes that mental health should be a key focus of disability awareness. Despite her largely positive outlook, she admits depression struck again recently when she turned 30 and still could not afford her own home.\nShe continues to battle for compensation against the company she says fired her unfairly.\n\"Fighting is exhausting,\" she says. \"But change will only happen when more people talk about disability and demand change.\"",

        "article_text": "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.\nBut the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.\nThe technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly. \nMask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?\nThe LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.\nAccording to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).\n\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.\nA recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.\nUS space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.\nSince then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.\nBut at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.\nThe main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.\nDr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.\n\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.\n\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.\nSkincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.\nThis is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.\nDr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.\n\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.\n\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.\nWhen you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.\nNatalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.\nThe skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"\nShe adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.\nO'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.\n\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.\nPart of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.\nLaurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.\nHe started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.\n\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.\nNewman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.\nNewman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.\nHe emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.\nDr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.\n\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds. \n\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".\nHe says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.\nDr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Uncle Harry... he's the best supporter ever' - Lampard\nTaking over from the EFL's longest-serving boss was never going to be an easy task for Frank Lampard.\nMark Robins had spent seven years with Coventry City, won two promotions, nearly reached the Premier League and then almost guided them to an FA Cup final just six months before he was sacked on 7 November last year.\nThey were big shoes to fill.\n\"I like to prove people wrong,\" Lampard said following his appointment - a decision that was not universally backed by the Sky Blues fanbase at the time.\nThe former Chelsea, Everton and Derby County manager has already gone some way to doing just that following an impressive recent run of form.\nWhen Lampard took over three weeks after Robins left, Coventry were 17th in the Championship, 10 points from the play-off spots and only two points above the relegation zone.\nA little more than three months later and Coventry are now fifth, propelled by eight wins from their past nine, losing only against leaders Leeds United in that time.\nWith their next test the visit of Stoke City - and return of Robins to the CBS Arena for the first time since his departure - BBC Sport takes a look at Lampard's progress in the West Midlands so far.\nCoventry are leading a tight group of at least seven teams realistically fighting for the two final play-off spots\nLampard says he \"didn't envisage\" climbing the table so quickly to challenge for the play-offs but also isn't \"getting carried away with where we are now\".\n\"I felt that we could improve and work ourselves up the table but the reality was, we were looking behind as much as ahead for a few weeks when we first got in,\" Lampard told BBC Football Focus.\n\"It's not easy to bring confidence, it's not easy to find the things in the team we need to correct, to be more compact.\n\"These things have to take a bit of work and time, so I wasn't sure how quickly it would happen.\n\"We're not going to get automatic promotion, we know that gap is too big. But can we do everything in our power to close the gap? I thought we could, I just didn't think we would get in as quickly.\n\"So, the next challenge is to show consistency.\"\nCoventry last won eight games from nine in the 1969-70 season\nCoventry are on their best run in the league for 55 years in terms of sheer points accumulation over a nine-game period.\nTheir recent tally of eight wins in nine matches is their most since they did the same between November 1969 and February 1970, in what was then Division One (now the Premier League).\nThe Sky Blues strung together 14 games without defeat in 2020 (W11 D3) on the way to winning League One under Robins, also between January and March, but didn't exceed 24 points in any nine consecutive outings despite that streak.\nSimilarly, Lampard has never been on such a run during his managerial career, even when he took Derby to the Championship play-offs in 2018-19, nor with Chelsea the following campaign when the Blues finished fourth in the top flight.\nCoventry have scored more regularly and conceded less frequently under Lampard compared to Robins\nThe Lampard effect is clear to see, with Coventry improving on every metric in the Championship compared to Robins this season.\nThey have scored more goals per game under Lampard (1.50) than Robins (1.28) and also conceded fewer in each match (1.05 compared to 1.35).\n\"When you get in, you try and analyse the problems quickly and we were conceding too many goals,\" Lampard said.\n\"We weren't compact enough, we weren't aggressive enough, so we tried to really prioritise our off the ball work.\n\"The players have done it because they've bought into everything we've tried to say.\n\"I have to say, this group of players, the humility, the application of them is absolutely amazing.\"\nAmong the standout performers who have improved under Lampard are creative midfielder Jack Rudoni and winger Ephron Mason-Clark.\nNo other Coventry player has had more goal contributions than Rudoni since Lampard arrived, scoring three goals and providing six assists, while Mason-Clark has netted four times and laid on another four in that time.\nStriker Ellis Simms has also seen an upturn in performances, putting opposing defenders under more pressure than previously, and his output has increased, grabbing four goals and an assist, compared to just two goals under Robins.\nThat has perhaps stemmed from Simms having to fight for his spot with Lampard favouring striker Norman Bassette in the early stages of his Coventry tenure.\nLampard hasn't been afraid to tweak the line-up and shape either, shifting almost seamlessly between 3-5-2 and 4-3-2-1, whether that be with Simms and Brandon Thomas-Asante up top or Simms on his own.\nTatsuhiro Sakamoto has provided further attacking threat from midfield with three goals and an assist and the return of top goalscorer Haji Wright from injury could yet still prove timely.\n\"We've had challenges, had some injuries, had to change shape, be adaptable,\" Lampard said.\n\"Now we're getting players fit so now we've got this bit more competitive nature to the squad where we can make changes in game.\"\nIf the Sky Blues continue at the same two points per game ratio they've achieved since Lampard took charge, they will end the season on 75 points.\nThat tally would have seen them finish in a play-off spot in 21 of the previous 23 Championship campaigns.\n\"I think we have to feed off our position in a positive way,\" Lampard said.\n\"Our run-in is a challenge. We absolutely have to go game by game. We back ourselves now, we know we can compete, we've shown that in the last period.\n\"But we cannot take our foot off the pedal in terms of our work and our prep and everything we do, so I'm looking forward to seeing if we can keep this form and momentum because we will take some hits in those 11 games.\n\"We've had a really good run but it won't look that way all the time. I'm a realist, I understand. Can we bounce back from those quickly? That will be the test of where we are.\"\nCoventry have lost just once at the CBS Arena in the Championship since Lampard arrived (W6 D1)\nEven in their wildest dreams, Sky Blues fans couldn't have imagined things would be going as well as they are, right here, right now, under Frank Lampard.\nTo say his appointment was greeted by scepticism in some quarters would be something of an understatement, especially given whose shoes he was recruited to fill, and at one point, merely staying in the division would have been regarded as an achievement, never mind challenging for a play-off spot.\nThere have been some bumps in the road; most notably taking an early lead, but then having the floor wiped with them by Portsmouth, and leading 1-0 at Norwich, going into four minutes of added time, only to contrive to lose 2-1.\nHowever, the positives far outweigh the negatives to this point, and some long-standing demons have been exorcised as well - winning in Swansea for the first time in 75 years, and beating Preston in a league match, which hadn't happened since September 2007.\nHow's he done it? To this untrained eye, by instilling much-needed belief in the squad, working extremely hard, both on and off the pitch, collectively and individually with players to extract every last drop of positivity from them, and that approach is reaping huge dividends at the moment.\nAn outstanding example of that occurred just last weekend, at Oxford, when they took the lead twice, were pegged back twice, had a penalty saved at 2-2, and yet still went on to win 3-2.\nTrust me, as someone that's watched every game so far, that would not have happened earlier in the season.\nCredit must go to Lampard's coaches Joe Edwards and Chris Jones too - that's clearly a dynamic that works extremely well, and speaking on behalf of all City fans, long may it continue.\nCoventry have picked up more points than any other Championship side in the past nine games\n\"It's going quite well isn't it,\" Coventry fan Sam Riman told the BBC's Sky Blues fancast.\n\"Earlier this year, I remember saying, 'it's a bit of a write-off season, we'll just see what Lampard can do, see what that brings in the summer and go again next year'.\n\"And now here we are, fifth in the Championship table.\"\nLampard has made a habit of applauding the Coventry fans after each game and fist-pumping to the crowd when they win and BBC CWR sports editor Gurney says it \"shows he's got a bond with the fans by doing that\".\n\"Going back to the end of November when he first came in, he knew the previous incumbent was very popular with the fanbase and he needed to build that relationship pretty quickly and he's done that,\" Gurney said.\nSupporter Adam Sloman said the relationship Lampard has built with the fans was \"arguably the hardest part of the job\".\n\"He was very quick to say about the great work done by his predecessor but he was very careful to make sure he got the fans on side,\" Sloman said.\nLampard reiterated he's \"under no illusions\" how difficult the final two months of the campaign will be and says Coventry must \"guard against any form of complacency to be a top team\".\n\"Some things have come together nicely, it's a lovely period of time because we're winning games,\" he added.\n\"The next challenge is the bigger one. We've got the run-in and the minute you go 'we've cracked it', this game, this Championship will smack you in the face.\n\"There's a long way to make the play-offs, to get through the play-offs to make the final. But if we can do that, it would be huge for this city. \n\"It would be amazing.\"\nYou can watch Frank Lampard's interview with Football Focus on BBC One at 12:00 GMT on Saturday, 8 March.",

        "article_text": "From making history as Vogue's youngest-ever fashion editor to creating a gown fit for a Kennedy wedding \u2013 which would end up covered in grass stains \u2013 Vera Wang chronicles her career's surprising trajectory and shares some of her hard-won lessons as a woman at the top of her field.\nVera Wang may be best known for crafting some of the most memorable wedding gowns of all time. Mariah Carey, Victoria Beckham, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alicia Keys are just a few of the women who have chosen the designer for their big days. Less known is the fact that design wasn't her first foray into the fashion world\u2026 or even her second. Speaking to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, on her sit-down series Influential, Wang shares her long journey, from working at US Vogue to having her own creations grace those same pages.\nSpeaking to Kay, Wang shares that \u2013 like a true drama \u2013 her life and career have been a series of acts, and that each act has included the ever-present spectre of time looming over her. As a teenager, the designer wanted to be an Olympic figure skater, but failed to make the cut. After that, she landed a position as fashion editor at Vogue right after graduating from Sarah Lawrence College, New York, making history in the process at the age of 23.\n\"I was the youngest, probably, woman to ever be given the title of editor. Probably to this day,\" Wang says.\nHer time at the magazine spanned 17 years, but like her time on the ice, Wang says that her skills didn't always match her passion. She didn't qualify for the 1968 Olympic Games in Grenoble and she never rose to the title of editor-in-chief.\n\"Some of the things I have adored the most, and by that, I mean passionately loved, are not fields I necessarily succeeded at,\" she says.\nIt wasn't until she was 40 years old, with Vogue and a position at Ralph Lauren behind her, that she launched her namesake fashion label. Bridal collections were just the beginning. Eventually, her brand would expand to include ready-to-wear, shoes, sunglasses, fine jewellery, home goods and even her own prosecco. Becoming too old for ice skating and the glossy world of magazines made Wang reassess what her next steps could be, even before she had the idea of putting her name on anything, much less everything.\n\"Women were considered transparent at a certain age, even in terms of their career,\" Wang says. \"You will age out of a career. I do not just mean modeling, I do not just mean being an editor,\" she adds, explaining to Kay that it takes a certain grit to outlast these supposed expiration dates. \"It is not about age, it is about style. And that is always how I felt. I have never not felt that way.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 'I was born to be an actor': Twice-knighted Derek Jacobi on nearly 70 years on the stage and screen\n\u2022 Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to face a career beyond dance\nWhen she decided to start with bridal gowns, Wang reflected on the approach to her own wedding. In 1989, Wang married investor Arthur P Becker (the two have since separated) and he had only one request of her for the ceremony.\n\"Please do not come in 'fashion'. Please look like a bride. [...] I want to make sure you look like a bride,\" Wang recalls him telling her.\nShe wouldn't be satisfied with simply following protocol. Blending her Chinese heritage into the ceremony, which was interfaith and drew from both Baptist and Jewish traditions, she inadvertently helped popularise the trend of brides slipping into a more festive look for their receptions.\n\"I got to change, because in Chinese culture, you change from the western [wedding] dress [into a] Chinese dress. But I changed into a party dress for afterwards. I started a trend way back in 1989, to change,\" Wang says.\nA tradition of the \"going-away\" outfit dates back to the 1930s. It was generally something more comfortable for brides to wear to bid goodbye to their guests before being whisked away on their honeymoons. Wang\u2019s choice to slip into something more festive has since become more widespread. High-profile brides \u2013 from the Princess of Wales (then the Duchess of Cambridge) and Princess Eugenie, to US actor Mandy Moore \u2013 frequently opt for a second dress for their evening reception.\nWhat she did with her wedding would come to mark Wang's go-to move of adding a dash of irreverence to the usually stuffy world of bridal fashion \u2013 something her clients could feel when they chose one of Wang's gowns.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"My first client was Ethel Kennedy. Her son, Max, was getting married and marrying a beautiful girl who was a law student. I spent eight months on that dress, and within 10 minutes of the ceremony, she was out kicking a football with the Kennedy brothers,\" Wang says.\nNow aged 75, Wang is well aware of her age, and that age is a topic of conversation around her. She tells Kay that she's noticed a shift in individuals being more critical of others and themselves today, a trend she blames on the rise of social media. Instead of focussing on how other people saw her as she grew older, Wang notes that as she has navigated the various acts of her career and life, she has focused on finding her passions and not what she saw in the mirror. This was a privilege, she reflects, of the era in which she was ageing.\n\"We did not have social media, and everybody did not age right before your very eyes, and everybody was not critical,\" she tells the BBC. \"It was really more about finding your way.\" Looking back at the 1990s and 2000s, she adds, \"I do not see that obsession with ageing that I have felt for the last two decades.\" Nevertheless, Wang's red carpet looks and social media posts prove that she's not shying away from the image that she cultivated over the years. She stays true to the sky-high platforms, micro-mini hemlines and long, lean silhouettes that have characterised her designs and personal appearances over the decades. She tells Kay that her age doesn't factor in how she gets dressed \u2013 and it never has.\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Since coming into office, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed Ukraine's leader for not wanting peace with Russia. \nHours later, however, the US president told reporters he was \"finding it more difficult to deal with Ukraine\", and repeated that he trusted Putin.\nLast Friday, Trump berated Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Days earlier, he had even called him a dictator and blamed Ukraine for starting the war which began on 24 February 2022 when Putin launched a full-scale invasion of the neighbouring country.\nThe public dressing-down was followed this week by Trump pausing all US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. \nIt is not clear if this enabled Russia's large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Thursday night.\nOn Friday morning, Trump issued his threat of sanctions tariffs against Russia - apparently over the attack.\n\"They [Russia] are bombing the hell out of them [Ukraine] right now... and I put a statement out, a very strong statement 'can't do that, can't do that',\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday.\nAsked if that was a result of the US pause in military co-operation with Ukraine, Trump said Putin was doing \"what anyone else would do\".\nAnd he justified the US move by saying: \"I want to know they [Ukraine] want to settle and I don't know they want to settle.\" \n\nIn Friday's post, Trump wrote: \"I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.\"\nHe did not provide any details as to how such sanctions and tariffs against Russia may work.\nMoscow is already under the heaviest Western sanctions in its history, many of which target its oil exports and foreign currency reserves. \nIt has been able to get around them to a large extent by selling discounted oil to India and China, while importing many of the goods it previously got from the West through countries like Kazakhstan. \nChina is reported to be helping to sustain Russia's war effort with large volumes of dual-use technology, which it denies.\nThe White House administration cannot have failed to notice the chorus of criticism that all the pressure for a peace deal is being piled on just Ukraine, not Russia. So it is possible that Trump's threat is an attempt to present itself as being more even-handed. \nThe problem is, we simply do not know what was discussed and what was agreed in that \"lengthy and highly productive\" 90-minute phone call that Donald Trump suddenly announced he had held last month with the Russian president. \nSo far, Vladimir Putin has played a clever hand, sitting back and doubtless enjoying watching the transatlantic alliance come apart at the seams. \nCompared to that gain, the threat of US tariffs is unlikely to bother him unduly.",

        "article_text": "It is often said that marriages are made in heaven.\nBut in India, where a majority of marriages are arranged, the process of match-making can feel like a passage through hell for a woman and her family.\nThat's the premise of Sthal: A Match, the 2023 gritty Marathi-language film that has won several prestigious awards at festivals in India and abroad. It is releasing for the first time in theatres in India on Friday.\nSet in rural Maharashtra state, the film centres around Savita, a young woman striving for an education and a career in a patriarchal society, and the attempts by her father Daulatrao Wandhare - a poor cotton farmer - to find a good husband for his daughter.\n\"He wants a good price for his crop and a good match for his daughter,\" says director Jayant Digambar Somalkar.\nThe film is notable for the unflinching way it portrays what its lead actress calls the \"very humiliating\" experience of many young women, unlike other Indian movies about arranged marriage.\nSthal has also grabbed attention as its entire cast is made up of first-time actors chosen from the village where it is shot. Nandini Chikte, who plays Savita, has already won two awards for her brilliant performance.\nThe film opens with a sequence where Savita is interviewing a prospective groom.\nAlong with her female relatives and friends, she watches as the young man serves them drinks from a tray. They laugh when he, visibly nervous, fumbles during questioning.\nRudely awakened from what turned out to be a dream, Savita is told to get ready as a group of men are coming to see her.\nIn reality, the gender roles are completely reversed, and in a scene that's replayed several times in the nearly two-hour film, Savita's humiliation comes into sharp focus.\nThe prospective groom and other men from his family are welcomed by Savita's father and male relatives. Guests are fed tea and snacks and once the introductions are done, Savita is called in.\nDressed in a sari, with eyes downcast, she sits down on a wooden stool facing her interrogators.\nQuestions come, thick and fast. What's your name? Full name? Mother's clan? Date of birth? Height? Education? Subject? Hobbies? Are you willing to work on the farm? \nThe men step out, to hold a discussion. \"She's a bit dark. She had makeup on her face, but did you not see her elbow? That is her real colour,\" says one. \"She's also short,\" he goes on to add. Others nod in agreement.\nThey leave, telling Daulatrao that they will respond in a few days to let him know their decision.\nAccording to her parents, \"this is the fourth or fifth time someone has come to see Savita\" - all the earlier meetings have ended in rejection, leading to heartbreak and despair.\nThe scene rings true. In India, men often have a laundry list of attributes they want in their brides - a glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers and match-making websites shows everyone wants tall, fair, beautiful brides.\nSavita's protestations - \"I don't want to get married, I first want to finish college and then take civil services exams and build a career\" - carry no weight in her rural community, where marriage is presented as the only goal worth having for a young woman.\n\"Marriage is given far too much importance in our society,\" Chikte told the BBC. \"Parents believe that once the daughter is married, they will become free of their responsibility. It's time to change that narrative.\" \nShe says she found it \"very humiliating\" that Savita was made to sit on a stool to be judged by all those men who discussed her skin colour, while there was no discussion about the prospective groom.\n\"I was only acting, but as the film progressed, I lived Savita's journey and I felt angry on her behalf. I felt insulted and disrespected.\" \nThe film also tackles the social evil that is dowry - the practice of the bride's family gifting cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family. \nThough it has been illegal for more than 60 years, dowries are still omnipresent in Indian weddings.\nParents of girls are known to take out huge loans or even sell their land and house to meet dowry demands. Even that doesn't necessarily ensure a happy life for a bride as tens of thousands are killed every year by the groom or his family for bringing in insufficient dowries. \nIn the film too, Daulatrao puts up a \"for sale\" sign on his land, even though farming is his only source of livelihood.\nDirector Somalkar says the idea for his debut feature film is rooted in his own experience.\nGrowing up with two sisters and five female cousins, he had witnessed the ritual far too many times when prospective grooms visited his home.\n\"As a child you don't question tradition,\" he says, adding that the turning point came in 2016 when he accompanied a male cousin to see a prospective bride.\n\"This was the first time I was on the other side. I felt a bit uncomfortable when the woman came out and sat on a stool and was asked questions. When we stepped out for a discussion, I felt the conversation about her height and skin colour was objectifying her.\"\nWhen he discussed the issue with his fianc\u00e9e at the time - who is now his wife - she encouraged him to explore it in his work.\nIn a country where 90% of all marriages are still arranged by families, Sthal is not the first to tackle the subject on screen. IMDB has a list of nearly 30 films about arranged marriage made by Bollywood and regional film industries just in the past two decades. \nMore recently, the wildly popular Netflix show Indian Matchmaking focused entirely on the process of finding the perfect partner.\nBut, as Somalkar points out, \"weddings are hugely glamourised\" on screen. \n\"When we think of weddings in India, we think of the big fat wedding full of fun and glamour. We think of Hum Aapke Hain Koun,\" he says, referring to the 1990s Bollywood blockbuster that celebrates Indian wedding traditions. \n\"And the Netflix show only dealt with a certain class of people, the ones who are wealthy and educated and the women are able to exercise their choice. \n\"But the reality for a majority of Indians is very different and parents often have to go through hell to get their daughters married,\" he adds.\nHis reason for making Sthal, he says, is to \"jolt society and audiences out of complacency. \n\"I want to start a debate and encourage people to think about a process that objectifies women who have very little freedom to choose between marriage and career,\" he says. \n\"I know one book or one film doesn't change society overnight, but it can be a start.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week.\nIt is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from America's two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets.\nOn Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25% import levies just a day after they came into effect.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canada's finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a \"colourful\" conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump.\nThe US president used profane language more than once during Wednesday's heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports. \nTrudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief.\n\"Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\" he said.\nA first round of Canadian retaliation targeting C$30bn ($21bn, \u00a316bn) of US goods is already in effect.\nThe trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence. \nOn Thursday afternoon, the leading US stock indexes were all lower, with the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest American companies, ending down nearly 1.8%.\nIn signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market. \n\"Nothing to do with the market,\" Trump said. \"I'm not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening.\"\nThe carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term. Items that currently come into the US under the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide.\nA White House official said about 50% of US imports from Mexico and 62% from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order.\nThe White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored, \"reciprocal\" trade duties on countries around the world.\nTrump said he agreed to grant the exemptions until 2 April after a phone call with Sheinbaum and they were aimed at helping carmakers and parts suppliers. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.  \nSheinbaum said on Thursday that she had had an \"excellent and respectful\" call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, said afterwards that \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\". \nEarlier, as relief looked likely but before it was announced, he told CNN that the province still planned to go ahead with a 25% tariff on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota from Monday.\n\"Honestly, it really bothers me. We have to do this, but I don't want to do this,\" he said.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday dismissed retaliation as counter-productive for trade negotiations. \n\"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh we're going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. \nGoods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and the economies of the three countries are deeply integrated after decades of free trade. \nTrump has argued introducing tariffs will protect American industry and boost manufacturing. However, many economists say tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US, while warning they could trigger severe economic downturns in Mexico and Canada. \nAbout $1bn in trade enters the US from Mexico and Canada each day that does not claim duty-free exemptions under USMCA, since it has historically enjoyed low or no tariffs, said Daniel Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide.\n\"Whether importers can or will start claiming USMCA remains to be seen, but it's a huge amount of money at stake,\" he said. \nIn the US, the economy is already starting to show the effects of the disruption from Trump's policies. \nImports spiked in January on the back of tariff fears, with America's trade deficit increasing 34% to more than $130bn (\u00a3100bn), the Commerce Department reported. \nGregory Brown, who leads BenLee, a company that makes big trailers, said he had had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trump's policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nBut Mr Brown, who attended Mr Bessent's speech, said that for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices \u2013 a sign that the economy is holding up.\n\"It's a great growth economy,\" he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trump's decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs as a sign of a business-friendly president adjusting to the \"business reality\".\nOthers were more worried that the back-and-forth would cause economic damage.\n\"I think we're going to have a recession before whatever succeeds in the future,\" one investment manager said. \"You're going to get the bad before you get the good.\"",

        "article_text": "California Governor Gavin Newsom has broken with many elected Democrats by saying he thinks it is \"deeply unfair\" to allow transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.\nNewsom,  a potential 2028 presidential contender who leads one of the most liberal states in the US and has long been a trailblazer on LGBT rights, made the comments on his new podcast. \n\"I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that,\" Newsom told conservative figure Charlie Kirk. \"It is an issue of fairness, it's deeply unfair. We've got to own that. We've got to acknowledge it.\" \nNewsom's change of tone comes amid a debate within his party over the extent to which cultural factors played a role in their resounding defeat in November, when Republicans won the White House and both chambers of Congress.\nA number of Democrats quickly denounced the governor's comments. \n\"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,\" a statement from California's LGBT legislative caucus read.  \nOn the debut episode of the governor's podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, his first guest was a pro-Trump activist whose Turning Point USA organisation advocates for conservative ideas on liberal-leaning college campuses. \nThe two discussed why Democratic nominee Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump, and Newsom said his party was being politically \"crushed\" on transgender issues.\nThe governor referred to a viral Trump campaign ad that had the tagline: \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\"It was devastating,\" Newsom said. \"And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating.\"\nKirk argued that Democrats were out of touch with everyday Americans because of broad support within the party for transgender athletes competing in sports, which he said was unfair. \n\"I revere sports,\" said Newsom. \"So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.\"\nThe governor added: \"The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well.\"\nFormer Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called Newsom's remarks about trans athletes \"disgusting\".\nPramila Jayapal, a left-wing Democrat representing a district in the north-western state of Washington, told Politico that her party should not \"take the bait and give into their anti-trans people rhetoric\". \nBut one moderate Democratic lawmaker agreed. \nSeth Moulton, of Massachusetts, told Politico that Newsom was correct and polling shows it. \n\"More and more are willing to say what they've probably always thought - and that's a good thing,\" he said. \nAccording to an opinion survey in January by the New York Times/Ipsos, almost all Republicans and nearly seven in 10 Democrats oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women's sports.\nThroughout his career, Newsom has positioned himself to the left of his party on LGBT rights.\nHe made headlines in 2004 as San Francisco mayor when he ordered the city clerk to issue same-sex marriage licences, which at the time wasn't allowed under state or federal law. \nNewsom made the state the first sanctuary for transgender youth and protected school curriculums that included LGBT history.\nLast year he signed legislation that made California the first state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify parents if their child changed gender identity.",

        "article_text": "Gurpreet Singh was handcuffed, his legs shackled and a chain tied around his waist. He was led on to the tarmac in Texas by US Border Patrol, towards a waiting C-17 military transport aircraft.\nIt was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. \"It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,\" he said.\nGurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home.\nThere are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022.\nNow Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority.\nGurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered.\nAbout 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India.\nUS Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: \"If you cross illegally, you will be removed.\"\n\"We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,\" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. \"We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off.\"\nOpposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \"There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?\" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader.\nGurpreet said: \"The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains.\"\nAn Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled.\nBut on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath.\n\"No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,\" said Gurpreet.\nIn the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called \"agents\", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police. \nGurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached.\n\"I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,\" said Gurpreet.\nWhile the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are \"unpaid helpers\", including women working in family businesses.\n\"We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (\u00a3270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,\" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after.\n\"You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.\"\n\nGupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said.\nHe said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected.\nThen he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/\u00a336,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us.\nOn 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US.\nGurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way.\nFrom Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Dari\u00e9n Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle.\nA dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Dari\u00e9n Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing.\n\"I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,\" said Gurpreet. \"We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest.\"\nEach group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a \"donker\" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term \"donkey route\" used for illegal migration journeys.\nAt night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest.\n\"It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,\" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers.\n\"My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers.\"\nWhen they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.\nGurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego.\n\"We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,\" he said.\nGurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter.\nOnce in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \nDuring the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation.\nIf they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime. \nThis is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with.\nInstead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started.\nIn their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.\nAdditional reporting by Aakriti Thapar",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump's cuts to the government workforce have started to hit, but overall hiring last month remained stable as growth in other sectors offset those losses. \nThe Labor Department said federal employment dropped by 10,000 in February.\nAcross the economy, employers added 151,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, from 4% in January.\nThe monthly report from the government is a closely-watched signal of economic health that was under particular scrutiny this month, amid rising concern about the economic disruption sparked by Trump administration policy changes. \nAnalysts had been forecasting about 170,000 new jobs. The monthly gain in February was similar to the average monthly rise of 168,000 over the past year, the Labor Department said. \nHiring was driven by healthcare and financial firms. The manufacturing sector also added about 10,000 jobs, gains that were highlighted by the Trump administration. \nGovernment hiring slowed sharply, while analysts cautioned that the report did not yet reflect the full extent of the cuts that the White House has announced.\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the report felt \"reassuringly in line with expectations, showing payrolls growth only modestly weaker than in recent months\". \n\"Yet, while the worst fears were not met, the report does confirm that the labour market is cooling,\" she warned.\n\"Furthermore, with no shortage of headwinds confronting the US economy, the softening trend is likely to persist and may potentially deepen given the toxic combination of federal government layoffs, public spending cuts, and tariff uncertainty related inertia.\"\nEven before Donald Trump took office as president, financial analysts had been surprised at the long-running streak of growth in the US labour market, which came despite pressure from price increases and high interest rates.\nIn his first weeks, Trump's changes to US policy have added to pressures on the economy, generating widespread uncertainty.  \nHis changes include tariffs on America's top three trade partners, some of which have since been reversed, and cuts to federal jobs and spending, efforts that are facing challenges in the courts. \nIn remarks at the White House, Trump acknowledged that \"there could be some disturbance\" in the economy. But he said he thought reducing the size of government and moving forward with tariffs would unleash private sector growth.\n\"I think the labour market's going to be fantastic but it's going to have high-paying manufacturing jobs as opposed to government jobs,\" he said, adding that he could not commit to policy certainty on trade.\n\"There will always be changes,\" he said.  \nPolls indicate that the moves have the support of his base. But financial analysts have warned that they are contributing to worries in financial markets, hurting consumer sentiment and fuelling weakness across a range of other economic indicators. \nThe latest jobs report showed average hourly pay up 4% compared with a year ago, but the number of people reporting they were working part-time because of slack business conditions jumped.  \nSeparately, a measure of manufacturing showed new orders dropping sharply last month. Retail sales posted their biggest drop in two years in January, while foot traffic at major chains such as Target, Walmart and McDonald's fell last month, according to data from tracking firm Placer.ai.\nPrivate firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that layoff announcements in February jumped to their highest level since July 2020, driven by government cuts.\nBut the number of companies warning of job cuts coming in the next few months also jumped, while starting to spread to new sectors, noted Andy Challenger, vice president of the firm. \nThe Labor Department report \"falls squarely in line with big slow cooling of the labour market that we've seen for two years - that story of that nice soft landing,\" he said.\n\"My expectation will be that as these get revised in the coming months, we'll start to see this look worse than it does at first blush.\"\nShares in the US were trading lower at around midday, with the S&P 500 down more than 1%.",

        "article_text": "The family of an Indian man who was shot dead while illegally crossing into Israel say he was a victim of a job scam.\nThomas Gabriel Perera was killed by Jordanian security forces by the border with Israel on 10 February.\nHe was lured to Jordan by the promise of a lucrative job, and when it did not materialise he tried to enter Israel as he was told he could find work there, his family told the BBC. \nReports of Indians falling for employment scams and illegally entering other countries to look for work have become increasingly common.\nPerera, 47, had been accompanied by his brother-in-law Edison Charlas, who was injured in the incident. Mr Charlas was treated in hospital and spent a fortnight in prison before he was repatriated to India.\nThe two men were from the southern Indian state of Kerala where they worked as auto-rickshaw drivers.\nAn agent had promised them they could get blue-collar jobs in Jordan earning 350,000 rupees ($4,000; \u00a33,110) a month.\nMr Charlas told the BBC he paid 210,000 rupees to an agent before they left India, and paid an additional $600 after reaching Jordan on a tourist visa.\nBut when the two men arrived in Jordan's capital city Amman in early February, they were told by the agent that there were no jobs available. \nThe agent then suggested they should try illegally crossing into Israel, claiming there were plenty of opportunities there.\nOn 10 February, Mr Charlas and Perera joined a group that drove for hours to Jordan's border with Israel.\n\"We were taken in a car. It was a long distance. We got into the car at 2pm and reached the location only around midnight. Then we were made to walk several kilometres along a coastline. It was while walking in the dark that we were shot,'' said Mr Charlas.\nThe BBC has seen a letter sent to Perera's family by the Indian embassy in Jordan. It states that \"security forces tried to stop them but they did not listen to the warning, the guards opened fire on them\".\n\"One bullet hit Mr Thomas [Perera] in his head and he passed away on the spot.''\nMr Charlas, however, disputed this account and said there was \"no such warning (from the guards). They just shot.''\n\"I was walking slowly behind the others in the dark... That was when the bullet hit me and I lost consciousness. I had no clue what happened to Thomas,'' he said.\nThe BBC has asked India's foreign ministry and Jordanian authorities for comment on Mr Charlas' allegation.\nMr Charlas said he was later taken to a hospital for treatment and then moved between several Jordanian government offices before being transferred to prison, where he was kept for 18 days.\nWhile in prison, he managed to contact his wife and told her what had happened, and his wife contacted Indian embassy officials.\nMr Charlas was deported to India on 28 February. \nPerera's body is still in Jordan. In response to BBC queries, India's foreign ministry said they were working to bring the body back to India as soon as possible.\n\"I am told that it will take one or two days for the process of documentation and other things to be completed,\" said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the foreign ministry.\nOn Monday, Shashi Tharoor, the member of parliament representing Perera's constituency Thiruvananthapuram, said that members of the Indian embassy in Jordan had verified the victim's identity and that the process of transportation of the body had begun. \nDespite numerous government warnings, many Indians are still falling prey to job scams and taking the risk of entering countries illegally to find work, say observers.\n\"The modus operandi is to get a tourist visa for one country and then enter the neighbouring country,\" said Ajith Kolassery, the CEO of Norka, the Kerala government's department overseeing migration.\n\"No country will accept illegal entry. We have been consistently issuing advisories to people to be wary of job rackets, but they are still going.\"\nIn recent years hundreds of Indians have been rescued from scam centres in Cambodia and other parts of South East Asia. They were trafficked to the centres after they were lured overseas by promises of good jobs. \nScores of Indian nationals were also tricked into fighting for Russia in the war with Ukraine after they were offered fake jobs and opportunities to study abroad.\nThe 100 Indians who were deported from the US last month after being accused of entering the country illegally had also been lured by the hope of a better life, pointed out Irudaya Rajan, who chairs the International Institute of Migration and Development in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\"They also paid money to agents and were cheated. It's the struggle to get better wages [that is driving this],\" he said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu \u2013 a custodian Buddhist deity \u2013 was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\u00a0\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\u00a0\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima Island\u00a0\u2013 a key stop along the way\u00a0\u2013 says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was \u2013 quite ambitiously \u2013 armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me \u2013 and other beginners \u2013 Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) \u2013 stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges \u2013 at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n\u2022\u00a0How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022\u00a0The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled Mukaishima Island.

No injuries or damage have been reported but images from those in Caribbean Sea island nations show fiery debris raining from the sky.\nThis was the eighth mission to test the rocket, and its second consecutive failure.\nThe spaceship, which measures 123m (403ft) at takeoff, was meant to re-enter Earth's orbit over the Indian Ocean after a one-hour flight.\nIts Super Heavy booster, which helps it leave the ground, did manage successfully to return to the launchpad.\nSpaceX, which is owned by billionaire Elon Musk, said teams immediately started co-ordinating with safety officials for \"pre-planned contingency responses\". \nThe statement added that SpaceX would review data \"to better understand [the] root cause\" of the misfire and noted the explosion happened after the loss of \"several\" engines. \n\"As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability.\"\nThe statement says debris should have fallen within a pre-planned area and the rocket did not contain any toxic materials. The company also included an email and phone number for those who believe they've found any remnants of the craft. \nMusk has yet to comment on Thursday's explosion.\nThe accident briefly halted flights at several Florida airports, including in Miami and Orlando, over concerns about flaming debris.\nA statement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the flights in and out of airports were delayed due to a \"space launch incident\". \nThe incident follows a test in January, which saw a Starship rocket fail minutes after launching from SpaceX's Texas facility.\nThe FAA also briefly closed airports two months ago, due to the same concerns about falling debris.\nAfter January's incident, the FAA grounded Starship launches and noted the incident had led to property damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.\n\"Unfortunately this happened last time too, so we have some practice at this now,\" SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot told reporters at the launch site on Thursday.\nThis latest Starship launch was conducted before the FAA finished investigating January's explosion, according to US media reports. \nA statement issued from the government of the Turks and Caicos said they were in contact with US authorities and SpaceX and would \"continue to keep the public apprised as we work to ensure the safety and security of our Islands\". \nFootage posted on X purported to show flaming rocket debris falling over the Caribbean Sea. In the Bahamas, people posted that they were seeking shelter in order to take cover from debris.\nStarship is the biggest, most powerful rocket ever built, and is key to Musk's ambitions for colonising Mars.\nSpaceX's Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket - collectively referred to as Starship - is intended to be fully reusable, the company says.\nNasa hopes to use a modified version of the spaceship as a human lunar lander for its Artemis missions to return to the Moon.\nIn the more distant future, Musk wants Starship to make long-haul trips to Mars and back - about a nine-month trip each way.",

        "article_text": "Football fans - including Manchester United supporters at Old Trafford last weekend - have protested against rising ticket prices this season\nFootball fans can be tribal. But when it comes to ticket prices, there is unity.\n\"We are all fighting the same fight on ticket prices,\" said Manchester United Supporters' Trust CEO Duncan Drasdo.\n\"Clubs are exploiting loyalty and fans are united in saying enough is enough.\"\nWhen 19 of the Premier League's 20 clubs raised their ticket prices before the 2024-25 season, the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) launched a campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty'.\nThose protests have grown again this season, with some clubs removing concessionary discounts for the elderly and young people - and teams like Arsenal announcing increases for 2025-26.\nThe cost of competing for trophies, increasing operational expenses, and the threat of complying with financial regulations, have all been given as reasons for price hikes.\nBBC Sport has analysed a new Uefa report showing the league's financial power and how much clubs make from tickets - but also the challenge of increased staffing levels and expensive running costs.\nPremier League clubs made a total of almost 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) from selling tickets to home matches in 2023, Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report shows.\nThat figure is growing by about 10% per year, and is almost double that of Spain's  La Liga (\u00a3481m) and Germany's Bundesliga (\u00a3430m).\nThe report uses a mixture of full financial reporting of more than 700 clubs for 2023, plus 2024 figures from 130 of Europe's biggest clubs.\nOf the 10 clubs who generated the most income from gate receipts in 2024, six are English.\nThe same six Premier League clubs feature in the top 12 for another ticketing metric, which measures the money earned per fan, per ticket.\n\"What the figures show is that English top-flight clubs are doing very well financially in a whole number of different metrics,\" says Tom Greatrex, chair of the FSA.\n\"Healthy ticket revenue shows people are wanting to go - but also shows the ratcheting up of ticket prices in the past few years. That is manifesting itself in the protests and disenchantment we've seen.\"\nThe report also points out that \"stadium expansions and/or increases in premium seating and hospitality have also doubled gate revenues at Paris St-Germain, Bayern [Munich], Liverpool and Manchester City since 2009\".\nArsenal and Tottenham's positions are helped by sales of high-value hospitality seats at modern stadiums in London - one of the world's most-visited cities.\n\"What we have seen clubs do through stadium expansion is a huge focus on those seats being hospitality,\" says Dan Plumley, senior lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University. \n\"On a basic financial level it makes sense, because you can generate more from that than a baseline seat. \n\"But if that is stopping your more average fan getting a ticket, that is something clubs are going to have to grapple with.\"\nThe report states the average amount made per fan from tickets is \u00a329-\u00a337 \"for the majority of clubs\".\nFans from four rival clubs to protest at ticket prices\nMan Utd fans criticise ticket prices - as club reveals manager change costs\nPremier League ticket price rises - what the fans think\nThe Uefa report paints a similar picture to other research such as the annual Deloitte Money League - with Premier League clubs bringing in far more revenue  (\u00a36.2bn in 2023) than other European leagues.\nHowever, English clubs reported a combined loss of \u00a3728m before tax.\nTV rights deals are showing signs of plateauing, so clubs need to maximise matchday income and commercial and sponsorship revenues to try to offset significant spending on transfers, wages and running costs in order to turn a profit.\nThe report outlines some eye-watering spending figures:\nPremier League clubs spent \u00a34bn on player wages in 2023, almost double second-placed Spain (\u00a32.1bn).\nFour European clubs have squads that cost more than 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) to assemble by the end of 2024, and all are English - Chelsea (1.7bn euros/\u00a31.4bn), Manchester City (1.3bn euros/\u00a31.1bn), Manchester United (1.1bn euros/\u00a3920m), and Arsenal (1bn euros/\u00a3840m).\nChelsea's 2024 squad was found to be \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record - the 2020 Real Madrid squad. The report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nFour of the five most profitable clubs - by pre-tax profits - in 2024 were German: Bayern (\u00a353m), Borussia Dortmund (\u00a341m), Lazio (\u00a334m), Leipzig (\u00a331m), Eintracht Frankfurt (\u00a327m).\nThree of the five least profitable clubs in 2024 - by pre-tax losses - were English: Juventus (\u00a3164m), Chelsea (\u00a393m), Aston Villa (\u00a384m), Roma (\u00a363m), Liverpool (\u00a355m).\nPlumley says: \"Each individual club will have its own reasons for doing it, but raising ticket prices doesn't shift the dial massively in terms of the overall picture of the finances.\n\"I get that costs have gone up, we understand that side of the equation, but this is where it really grinds with fans.\"\nFans of some clubs have been contesting the loss of concessionary tickets for the elderly, juniors, and disabled supporters\nManchester United's controversial plans to make up to 450 redundancies,, external cut about 39% of its workforce and \"return the club to profitability\" have put a sharper focus on how many people are actually needed to run a football club - and the operating costs involved.\nWhile transfer spending remains a club's biggest outgoing, the report says high inflation in areas such as utilities, plus the wages spent on more employees to expand commercial activity, is biting. \nOperating costs have risen by 12% across Europe, with a total of \u00a31.5bn spent in the Premier League in 2023, almost \u00a3500m higher than second-placed Germany\nOperating costs plus non-player wages absorb just under half the revenue of big-five European league clubs\nIn 2024, six Premier League teams featured in the top 10 for money spent on operating costs.\n\"Operations costs have increased - that's fair,\" Greatrex says. \"But increasing ticket prices way beyond the level of inflation, year after year, which is what has started to happen with most clubs in the Premier League - and then trying to claim that PSR or financial fair play are the reason - is the clubs treating people as though they're idiots.\"\nSalaries paid to non-footballer staff members have also risen sharply.\nThe average top 20 club in Europe has 970 full-time employees - Barcelona have the most with 1,781\nFour Premier League teams have more than 1,000 full-time employees - Man Utd, Brighton, Liverpool and Man City\nPremier League clubs employed a total of 11,081 full-time employees by the end of 2023\nEnglish top-flight clubs paid a total of \u00a31bn in non-player wages in 2023. That total, which includes wages paid to staff members such as coaches, media departments and ticket office personnel, is more than twice that of second-placed Germany\nThere was 19% inflation on non-player wages across Europe in 2023 and for the biggest clubs, head coach wages rose on average 21% in 2024\nThat compares to a more modest average growth of 4.5% in player wages in 2024, which the report said was \"essential for financial stability as clubs struggle with strong inflation\".\nThe logic behind the rise in staffing numbers varies per club. Brighton, for example, employ a notoriously vast recruitment and scouting operation.\nThe report states that employee growth can be explained by clubs' desire to wring more from commercial and sponsorship deals.\nAcross Europe, income from commercial and sponsorship deals has risen by 39% since 2019.\n\"Commercial income is almost untapped in terms of potential and there is no restriction on the number of deals you can sign,\" Plumley says. \n\"But you have to throw more resource at that.\n\"There are more roles now in football clubs than ever before. Some of them are quite forward thinking.\n\"It's a natural consequence of how the game has evolved, because everyone is pushing for growth, growth, growth.\"",

The government says it is aware of the harm caused by chemsex and has issued guidance to local authorities on managing the issue.\nChris was initially offered drugs at a party, but it was not until a few months later that he then began to actively seek it out more and find people who were taking drugs.\nHe said at first it took away \"a lot of the shame and guilt you have about growing up being gay. It's kind of quite liberating\".\nHowever, that quickly changed.\n\"No-one really speaks about it. Everyone is slightly ashamed about it. It's all behind closed doors. It doesn't really spill out into the real world. It's very secretive,\" he said.\nChris said his friends told him he was almost like a \"zombie\".\n\"Slowly, your life starts to deteriorate because you are missing work on a Monday. And then your work is obviously not up to standard. \n\"You can't do much until Wednesday. And then it all starts again on a Friday,\" he said.\n\"You have to eat, you have to sleep, you have to get on with your life but all you're really doing is looking forward to the next time you can take drugs,\" he added.\n\"Which is to escape the horror that is your life, the misery that is your life which you've created but, in a way, you don't seem to see that because all you want to do is take drugs.\"\nCampaigners have said chemsex among some gay men has a stigma attached that meant many were not seeking the help they needed.\nIgnacio Labayen De Inza, chief executive of the London-based charity Controlling Chemsex, is calling for people to start a conversation around chemsex to help change that stigma.\nHe said: \"Chemsex is very available but not everyone has access to reliable information.\n\"Not just the government but no-one is doing very much. People think there is nothing we can do because it's going to carry on happening, but people could make sure that they set boundaries and to keep safe.\"\nHe said there was a stigma attached to it because \"we are talking about sex, we are talking about gay sex, we are talking about drugs\".\nPhilip Hurd, a specialist adviser at Controlling Chemsex, was involved in chemsex 12 years ago and said it took a near-death overdose for him to realise he needed to stop.\nHe said: \"You get close to the criminal justice system, and you start doing things that are dangerous.\n\"And then I had a near-death overdose. The doctors said I was very lucky to survive, and I had to get my parents down from the country in their early eighties. That was the point I thought I can't do this; I'm going to die.\"\nMr Hurd, who lives in London and now volunteers at Controlling Chemsex, uses his personal experience to help others.\n\"I think it's possible for a person with good psychology, sociology skills to support somebody coming out of chemsex but nothing can replace having been there knowing,\" he said.\nAn Opinium Research poll of 2,000 people for the charity found that 76% of those surveyed were not familiar with chemsex.\nJust over a third of those who identified as gay/lesbian were not familiar with the risks of chemsex, the study also found.\nVeronika Carruthers, a lecturer at Portsmouth University, has been looking into the current support available across the south of England and found it was still \"pretty limited\" and \"patchy\".\n\"We consider this to be a bit of a postcode lottery,\" she said.\nShe explained that some people did not know the right services to turn to.\n\"Particularly if we look at it from a divide of drug counselling services and sexual health clinics, while sexual health clinics are preferred there is still an element of staff not having the appropriate knowledge of what chemsex actually is and in turn not being able to provide the most effect support,\" she said.\n\"In regards to drug counselling services, quite often we have recovery workers who have never actually heard of chemsex and therefore they're not able to provide any form of support and individuals often don't feel that is the most appropriate place for them.\n\"As a result people don't want to call for help or support from particular organisations over others.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said in addition to issuing guidance to local authorities, it had boosted the Public Health Grant by almost \u00a3200m. \n\"Local authorities can use this to improve drug and alcohol treatment and recovery interventions, including for people involved in chemsex,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We continue to work with substance misuse commissioners and sexual health commissioners to improve access to support services for those who use drugs in this context.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen is aiming to become only the second driver to win five successive drivers' championships in 2025\nRed Bull might have won the world drivers' title for the fourth year in a row with Max Verstappen last year, but they head into the new season under conspicuous pressure.\nThey have lost their design guru, following Adrian Newey's move to Aston Martin, rivals are circling around Verstappen, and over the second half of last year, Red Bull had only the third fastest car in Formula 1.\nSo what is at stake for Red Bull as they head into the final year of F1's current regulations?\nVerstappen's fourth title was founded on the points advantage he built in a brief period of dominance at the start of the year, and an outstanding performance from the Dutchman for the remainder of the season.\nFrom the sixth race of the season in Miami, the car no longer retained the massive advantage over the rest of the field it had enjoyed in the first five races, or the two preceding years.\nYes, it ended the year as on average the fastest car in qualifying - by 0.052 seconds over the McLaren. But take the numbers from Miami onwards and the McLaren was faster by 0.053secs. Over the second half the season, the McLaren was faster by 0.142secs and Red Bull were also slower than Ferrari - by 0.008secs.\nHad McLaren started the season in a stronger position, therefore, Verstappen's championship would have been a lot harder to win.\nRed Bull's issue was that a fundamental balance disconnect became more apparent as they tried to add performance to their car. They struggled to solve their mid-corner, slow-speed understeer without creating oversteer in the fast corners.\nNewey said: \"Already through the very last stages of '23, the car was starting to become more difficult to drive,\" Newey said. \"Max could handle it. Checo (Sergio Perez) couldn't.\n\"That carried into the first part of '24, but the car was still quick enough to be able to cope with it.\n\"It's something I was starting to become concerned about, but not many other people in the organisation seemed to be very concerned about it.\n\"And from what I can see from the outside, but I don't know\u2026 the guys at Red Bull, this is no criticism, but I think they just \u2013 perhaps through lack of experience \u2013 kept going in that same (development) direction. And the problem became more and more acute, to the point that even Max found it difficult to drive.\"\nRed Bull believe they lost ground because they did not exploit aero-elasticity of front wings as much as McLaren, Mercedes and later Ferrari.\nThis method of construction enables teams to build the carbon-fibre in their front-wing in such a way as to have the elements flex downwards at high speed, reducing downforce and therefore oversteer, but have them move back into optimum downforce mode at slower speeds.\nNew rules for this season limit the flexibility of wings - at the rear from the first race, and at the front from the Spanish Grand Prix in June.\nThe question is whether this was the sole issue Red Bull faced, and whether they can catch up the ground McLaren and Ferrari made last year, and whatever development progress their rivals have made over the winter.\nNewey's departure came in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment and coercive, controlling behaviour made against team principal Christian Horner by a female employee.\nHorner has always denied the allegations and was cleared by two separate Red Bull internal investigations. But they unsettled Newey, and added to the disquiet Red Bull's design chief was already feeling about internal politics within the engineering team.\nThere was a disagreement as to who was primarily responsible for Red Bull's recent success. Newey felt technical director Pierre Wache was unfairly pushing for credit - and Horner backed him publicly. Whereas Newey saw the 2022 car and fundamental concept Red Bull followed for F1's current regulations as very much his.\nThe 2025 car will inevitably be an evolution of the 2024 design, given that this is the final year of a set of technical regulations and there is massive change coming for next year.

Nevertheless, Newey's departure gives Wache and the rest of the design team a chance to prove themselves out of Newey's shadow.It is a chance for Red Bull to prove a point, but it could go either way.Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has already been quoted saying that he believed the team were slower to get on top of their problems in 2024 than they would have been had Newey still been involved.If they cannot return to having the best car, then there will be a major spotlight on Red Bull and serious questions being asked.Could Verstappen leave?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max and Jos Verstappen with Red Bull team boss Christian Horner during pre-season testing in Bahrain last monthThe pressure on Red Bull is all the greater because of the potential ramifications of this year on Verstappen's future.The Dutchman, 27, is under contract to Red Bull until the end of 2028, but his deal has performance clauses in it - the details of which are not known publicly. Will it hold?And it remains to be seen whether the complainant will take matters further legally.What about Verstappen's team-mate?After two seasons of Sergio Perez struggling alongside Verstappen, Red Bull finally lost patience with the Mexican at the end of last year and paid him off.That decision was very expensive - it was made despite Horner deciding in the early summer last year to grant Perez a two-year contract extension to the end of 2026, when they could have signed Carlos Sainz instead.In Perez's place, Red Bull have promoted New Zealander Liam Lawson.Horner acknowledges that being Verstappen's team-mate is probably the toughest job in F1, and Red Bull are asking Lawson to come in and do better than Perez after a career that has so far spanned only 11 grands prix for Red Bull's second team over two seasons.Can Lawson improve on Perez's performance?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liam Lawson drove five F1 races for Red Bull's second team in 2023 and six in 2024Lawson put in some creditable and combative performances on his return last year, following Red Bull's decision to drop Daniel Ricciardo from their Racing Bulls team.

But following a lengthy TMO review, the try was ruled out for a knock-on.\nFrom there, the momentum shifted dramatically, and after McCarthy was yellow carded for cynically pulling back Thomas Ramos, France immediately capitalised on their numerical advantage as Dupont sent Bielle-Biarrey over for his sixth try of the tournament.\nThat would be one of Dupont's last acts, though, as a knee injury sustained in a collision with Ireland second row Tadhg Beirne forced the French captain off to be replaced by Maxime Lucu, France's solitary backline replacement after head coach Fabien Galthie opted to pack seven forwards on to his bench.\nWithin five minutes of Dupont's exit, Ireland finally got on the scoreboard through Prendergast's penalty, and while Irish obstruction straight from the kick-off enabled Ramos to respond, the Ireland out-half's dead-eyed kick from halfway cut France's lead to two at the break.\nThis video can not be played\nFrance score 'irresistible' try\nLike they did in the first half, Ireland came flying out of the traps after the restart and scored within three minutes when Sheehan touched down in the corner from a maul.\nPrendergast converted and Ireland led 13-8, but that was as good as it got for the hosts as France hit back swiftly through Boudehent. \nIreland felt Flament should have been penalised for taking out O'Mahony off the ball and their frustrations deepened when Nash was shown a yellow card for head-on-head contact with Pierre-Louis Barassi.\nFrom there, France seized control, Bielle-Biarrey racing on to his own kick to score his second at the end of another electric counter-attack. \nReplacement flanker Jegou - filling in at centre following Barassi's injury - sealed the visitors' bonus point, and while Flament was sin-binned soon after, Penaud compounded Irish misery with a signature breakaway score. \nAfter Ramos intercepted Prendergast's pass, Penaud ecstatically dove over the line as he drew level with Blanco and rubbed salt into Irish wounds. \nFrance's 42-point haul was the most they have ever scored in Dublin and with 26 tries they are just three shy of England's championship record set in 2001. \nHaving felt the full force of a ferocious French performance, Ireland did score late tries through Healy and Jack Conan. \nIt was not enough to secure a try bonus, though, on an afternoon that belonged to France and Ireland will want to soon forget. \nIreland: Keenan; Nash, Henshaw, Aki, Osborne; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Porter, Sheehan, Bealham, McCarthy, Beirne, O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\nReplacements: Herring, Healy, Clarkson, Ryan, Conan, Baird, Murray, Crowley.\nSin-bin: McCarthy (20), Nash (47)\nFrance: Ramos; Penaud, Barassi, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Ntamack, Dupont (capt); Gros, Mauvaka, Atonio, Flament, Guillard, Cros, Boudehent, Alldritt.\nReplacements: Marchand, Baille, Aldegheri, Meafou, Auradou, Jegou, Jelonch, Lucu.\nSin-bin: Flament (74)\nReferee: Angus Gardner (Australia)",

rather pregnancy and the prospect of being kicked by not only one or two feet at a time, but potentially four, and as many arms.\n\"Twins, yeah, a massive shock,\" said the smiling GB athlete, who is competing at the European Rifle Shooting Championships while six months pregnant.\n\"It's definitely a strange one [to compete] and not a normal thing people do!\n\"I've had some rough training sessions ahead of the Europeans and some days where every shot felt like I was climbing Mount Everest because I was in so much pain and doubt was creeping into my mind.\n\"But, sometimes it's about showing up, pushing through and embracing that struggle; I also need to remember to not be too hard on myself because I am growing two humans inside me right now.\"\nMwandumba confesses that little can prepare you for the news that \"you have two in there\" but, on reflection, she feels her mind may have been preparing her in the days ahead of the first scan.\n\"Weirdly, I had a dream that the sonographer found more than one baby, so even though it was a surprise, I feel my body trying to warn me, so I feel like part of me knew deep down, inside, like intuition,\" she told BBC Sport.\nWhen prompted to reflect on her use of the word 'dream' rather than 'nightmare', she clarifies, while laughing; \"No actually you're right, it was a nightmare!\n\"I woke up going, 'that can't be happening, it's not happening, right?'\"\nThe 29-year-old has also endured a tricky pregnancy, with nausea and vomiting extending into her second trimester.\n\"The whole pregnancy in general was a bit of a shock because I struggle quite badly with endometriosis,\" she revealed.\n\"It took four years of experiencing extreme pelvic pain, as well as really, really intense periods, before I was first officially diagnosed in 2017 and I've had two surgeries since.\"\nEndometriosis is a condition in which tissue, similar to the lining of the uterus, grows outside the uterus, and can cause infertility.\nShe had \"difficult conversations\" with healthcare providers who warned her she might not be able to conceive naturally.\n\"It was almost scary to be discussing the possibility, at the age of 22-23, that I might not be able to have kids in the future.\n\"So, to have had those conversations and then all of a sudden be expecting twins, never mind just one, was a huge shock,\" said Mwandumba, who thought she might need IVF but ultimately did not require it.\n\"I think it's great to show it's not all doom-and-gloom and despite the negative experiences you can still get a beautiful experience at the end.\"\nUK Sport recently released enhanced pregnancy guidance, pledging to \"increase and improve support\" for female athletes.\nMwandumba's British team-mate Amber Rutter was one of the first to receive this additional assistance in the lead up to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where she ultimately won silver, three months after becoming a mother.\n\"British Shooting have been so supportive from the beginning and I think the experience with Amber before the Olympics means they can use a lot of the same support and resources,\" said Mwandumba, who was a travelling reserve for the Paris 2024 Games.\nWhile optimistic about the future, one area of concern is becoming a parent and bringing black children into the world.\nThe shooter, who has Malawian heritage, has been a prominent figure in the push for greater diversity in the sport, launching the #TargetChange initiative in 2022, while she has also previously spoken about her own concerns around racism in the UK.\n\"I think we're still very much in a scary world, and it definitely is something that scares me,\" she said.\n\"Change might be slow, but it is happening and I'll always be open with them about how they might be viewed or how they might approach certain situations, but hopefully by the time they are teenagers, things will be a bit different.\"\nWell before her children reach their teen years though, Mwandumba is hoping to not only return to the sport, but become an Olympian.\nShe was the reserve to Seonaid McIntosh in the 10m air rifle event at the 2024 Games and has set her sights on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\"Once upon a time, I felt as though pregnancy within elite sport automatically meant retirement, and obviously we're at a point now where that's not the case,\" said Mwandumba.\n\"So many people have been successful at their sport, gotten pregnant, had a family, then come back and have still managed to be just as successful, if not more so and I think that's so inspiring to those of us who are going through the journey.\n\"It's definitely motivated me to because my plan is to come back and still hopefully aim for those major competitions, with the Olympics the long-term goal.\n\"To do it with my twins watching on, would be all the more special.\"",

        "article_text": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu \u2013 a custodian Buddhist deity \u2013 was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\u00a0\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\u00a0\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima Island\u00a0\u2013 a key stop along the way\u00a0\u2013 says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was \u2013 quite ambitiously \u2013 armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me \u2013 and other beginners \u2013 Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) \u2013 stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges \u2013 at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n\u2022\u00a0How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022\u00a0The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled Mukaishima Island.

        "article_text": "A pro-Palestinian group has vandalised parts of Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland.\nPalestine Action posted photographs on social media showing red paint daubed across one of the buildings at the Ayrshire course.\nThe words \"Gaza is not for sale\" are sprayed across one green and another green appears to have been dug up. \nA further photograph shows a damaged lamp post at the resort owned by the Trump Organisation.

        "article_text": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu \u2013 a custodian Buddhist deity \u2013 was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\u00a0\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\u00a0\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima Island\u00a0\u2013 a key stop along the way\u00a0\u2013 says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was \u2013 quite ambitiously \u2013 armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me \u2013 and other beginners \u2013 Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) \u2013 stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges \u2013 at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n\u2022\u00a0How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022\u00a0The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled Mukaishima Island.

        "article_text": "Influential soul, jazz and funk producer and composer Roy Ayers has died at the age of 84.\nIn a statement posted on Facebook, his family said: \"It is with great sadness that the family of legendary vibraphonist, composer, and producer Roy Ayers announce his passing which occurred on March 4 2025 in New York City after a long illness.\"\nThey described him as \"highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.\"\nAyers' own biggest hit was the mellow track Everybody Loves the Sunshine, which was covered by artists like d'Angelo and sampled by others including Mary J Blige and Tyler, the Creator.\n\nBut he was so much more than his best-known record. A pioneer of nu-soul and jazz funk, he was a key figure in the 90s acid jazz movement. \nHappy and Blurred Lines singer Pharrell Williams has described him as one of his greatest musical inspirations. \nAyers had a huge influence on many RnB and hip-hop stars, particularly in the 90s, with artists like Tribe Called Quest, Mary J Blige and Jill Scott sampling his earlier work on tracks like Bonita Applebaum, My Life and Watching Me.\nHe also worked with Guru and The Roots. Erykah Badu called him \"the king of neo soul\".\nMore recently, Calvin Harris told BBC Radio 2 that Ayers \"just stood out, his music is amazing and just so intricate... everything just sounds so rich and warm\". \nAyers performed at Glastonbury several times; his last performance there was in 2019.\nHe also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Coffy starring Pam Grier.\nAyers could play several instruments, including the flute and trumpet but he became synonymous with the vibraphone, a percussion instrument that looks similar to a xylophone but has a set of metal bars rather than wood.\nHis other hits include Running Away and Searchin', with his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity, who were also behind Everybody Loves the Sunshine. \nRoy Edward Ayers Jr was born into a musical family in Los Angeles on 10 September 1940. \nHis mum Ruby was a school teacher and piano teacher, while his dad, Roy Sr, was a parking attendant and trombonist.\nAyers began playing the piano at the age of five and went on to play several instruments and sing in the church choir before plumping for the vibraphone.\nJazz star Lionel Hampton may have had something to do with that. Ayers attended a Lionel Hampton Big Band concert when he was just five. Quite taken by Ayers's enthusiasm and delight at the performance, Hampton gifted the youngster a pair of vibe mallets. \nAyers formed his first group while at Jefferson High School, aptly named the Jefferson Combo, and later studied advanced music theory at college.\nHe became a professional musician in 1961.\nHe went on to record three albums with jazz flautist Herbie Mann before forming Roy Ayers Ubiquity and landing the hit Everybody Loves the Sunshine in 1976, from the album of the same name.\nHis last solo album, Mahogany Vibes, featuring Badu, came out in 2004.\nAyers is survived by his wife Argerie, and their children Mtume and Ayana Ayers.\nThe Facebook post on Ayers's page added: \"His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy's life will be forthcoming.\"\n",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'No one wanted to give me a chance' - Gonzalez Quintero\nOn the streets they call him 'Kego'. The one-time wonderkid left to train alone in a concrete wilderness of city towerblock staircases. A cage footballer for hire, a pick-up game artist on speed dial. The embers of his professional dream still flickering in a footballing underworld.\nKevin Gonzalez Quintero was once Jude Bellingham's England room-mate, played in the same youth teams as Jamal Musiala and Harvey Elliott and was the guy a young Jhon Duran would ask for boots.\n\"Jude, he is a great lad,\" remembers Kego. \"He is very chill, a great person on and off the pitch. You can see why he is where he is today. Since that very young age he has had that leadership. Very mature.\"\nHis father once played for Deportivo Cali, but Kego's parents packed up and left a Colombia that he says was in the grip of Pablo Escobar and the nation's drug cartels to swap South America for a new life in south London before he was born.\nThat allowed Kego to shine in front of Crystal Palace scouts, joining the Eagles aged eight and later winning their academy player of the year.\nAfter a decade with Palace he believed he was destined for the Premier League and life on the international stage. As well as England, Kego represented Colombia at youth level.\n\"It was a dream,\" he says. \"I always wanted to play for Colombia. Duran was there with me. He is a funny guy.\n\"He has always been good, but he wasn't banging in goals like that. Which shows his dedication, his time. It worked out for him. I'm very happy for him, too. He deserves it, I saw how hard it was for him.\n\"I remember him asking me for football boots. Just seeing him now is like 'wow, you have grown so much and I am proud of you, man'.\"\nThose players have gone on to represent some of the world's biggest clubs - Bellingham at Real Madrid, Musiala at Bayern Munich and Elliott at Liverpool, while former Aston Villa striker Duran is making his fortune in Saudi Arabia.\nBut for Kego, it didn't work out like that. \nHe was released by Palace at 18 and, via false dawns and broken promises, spent four years travelling the world, trialling in 14 different countries, yearning for a professional contract.\n\"I thought I was going to have the world at my feet,\" says the now 22-year-old. \"I played with Colombia, I played with England. I was at Palace for 10 years. I was pretty sure I'd get a club, easily, but then I got exposed to the real world, quickly.\"\nJamal Musiala and Kego on England youth team duty\nSo what went wrong for Kego at Crystal Palace? He was offered an extension, he says, but it did not materialise. \n\"I got different advice that I shouldn't have listened to,\" recalls Kego. \"Two months later, they just told me 'Look, Kevin, we're not going to guarantee you any game time for next year, you're better off looking for other teams. You're a very good player, we believe you can start your professional career elsewhere'.\n\"I was very down, 10 years here and then just like that, gone.\n\"A few agents, they lied to me. Saying 'listen, we have got this club for you and this club'. They sell you the world. But when it came to the time, nothing happened. That was really upsetting.\"\nHe was caught in a spiral of failed trials and wasted journeys - Hungary, Spain, even Brazil.\n\"Before you know it, you're six months without a club, then a year, then it carries on going,\" adds Kego. \"They start questioning your ability. Often I heard from clubs 'Oh, but he's been out for six months, oh, two years now'.\n\"Then when I did get the chance, I would be so mentally drained, to the point I couldn't focus. And when I was there, there would be another agent telling me 'listen, I've got you a first-team game'.\n\"I went to another team in Spain. The agent sorted the travel and everything, but when I got there, he blocked me. I didn't hear from him again and I was left stranded.\"\nAt the same time, his mum became seriously ill and needed the support of Kego and his father. \n\"Seeing your mum, the person that raised you, when she's ill, that kills you as a son,\" he says. \"She is still recovering, she has days that are good and days that are bad. We are getting there.\"\nKego with Xavi Simons, now of RB Leipzig and the Netherlands, after a youth match against Barcelona\nKego with the Colombia Under-17s squad\n1 of 2\nTo stay prepared for an opportunity, Kego would train relentlessly on his own.\n\"It almost felt like a prison cell,\" he explains. \"You wake up, you train, you see the same surroundings over and over again. Four years, the same thing.\n\"I would wake up, I would see bricks, blocks. It's mad. Going from seeing grass, everything is cut for you, you have got new balls - now I am maybe playing with a flat football, playing with a tennis ball or a golf ball.\n\"It's called the towerblock in my area. Every day I would be running up the stairs, training with my dad. I would even go to the park, on an 11-a-side pitch, I would start passing the ball to imaginary team-mates and then I would go and chase after the ball myself. It wasn't easy, but you have to work with what you have.\"\nBut it was not just a physical battle. He could eat well and run until the sun came up - and friends say they would get calls at 4am to do just that - but mentally, with no end in sight, the churn was taxing.\n\"When you're not at a team you're getting frustrated because you know your talent, you know that you can do that, that you're a good player, you have played with the best before,\" says Kego. \"Mentally it is killing you.\"\nKego says he went \"deep inside my mind\". He tried new things - he practises Simran meditation and, as a Christian, studies the Bible and prays. \nBut he also found salvation on the streets, with a ball at his feet.\n\"Street football is what gives you that tempo,\" he beams. \"Short spaces. You have got to think quick. It really helped me. It gave me a lot of confidence. I was like 'you know what, if I can do it in this short space, imagine a bigger space'.\"\nKego built a reputation in cage tournaments and pick-up games, becoming renowned in street football circles and even earning a deal with Puma.\n\"Everyone knew if they wanted to win with style, call him,\" laughs Gundeep Anand, the founder of street football tournament The Last Stand.\nIt was in one such tournament Kego was spotted by Spanish side UD Ibarra, and suddenly the dream was revived.\nKego earned a glowing reputation on the street football scene, playing in tournaments such as The Last Stand \nDiego Maradona Jr is the head coach of Spanish side UD Ibarra, who play on the island of Tenerife\nIbarra, from Tenerife, play in the fifth tier but are pushing for promotion and showing ambition. They recently appointed Diego Maradona Jr as head coach.\n\"He passed the ball to me and I said 'what, wait, [it's like] his dad is passing the ball to me',\" Kego remembers of their first meeting on the training pitch. \"It's a bit mad. I was watching his dad's YouTube videos and then his son is passing the ball to me.\n\"The way they walk, they have a similar look. It's very motivating.\"\nThe forward is waiting to make his debut and Maradona Jr is keen to see the youngster kickstart his career in the Canary Islands.\n\"We needed a player like him,\" he says. \"Quick. Good technically, and had some experience in professional teams like Crystal Palace, the Colombian national team.\n\"He can bring speed to the game.  A player who can score many goals and who understands the game.\n\"We hope he can bring a different mentality that we are trying to change with the team and the club.\"\nKego describes joining Ibarra as \"relief\". Now, he says, \"it's time to shine\".\n\"I was buzzing, excited, very emotional as well,\" he adds.\n\"All these years of work, I would never have thought I would make it pro at 22. If I'm honest, I said let me just dedicate myself to playing street football.\"\nThat is one dream accomplished, but what comes next?\n\"I always think big,\" he smiles. \"Short term is smash it here, do my best, focus and try and get many goals and get the club promotion.\n\"Longer term... I want to be the best player in the world one day.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

Watching her fights previously with the team, that's what she does. Charges in, head down and swings. She did exactly what I expected,\" Dubois told Sky Sports.\n\"I feel like I need to learn how to fight on the inside. It's one thing doing it in sparring, but it's another thing doing it in the ring.

        "article_text": "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star. \nJust ask Lady Gaga.\nHer rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.\nTheir appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".\nAnd as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".\nWhen she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.\nOn stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.\n\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two. \n\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"\nNow 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.\n\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"\n\nThe couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.\nIn person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.\nBut on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.\n\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.\n\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'\n\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"\nIt was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.\n\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal. \n\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"\n\nThose feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem. \nCalled (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.\nShe calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.\nMayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.\nSpeaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.\n\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.\n\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"\n\nWith that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.\nOn the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".\nIn the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.\nThere's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created. \nIt all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.\n\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.\n\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.\n\"It kind of took me down.\"\n\nHow did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?\n\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.\n\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.\n\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.\n\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"\n\nIn previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.\nMayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.\n\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.\n\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"\n\nFrom the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase. \nLast summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.\nIt was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.\n\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.\n\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.\n\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"\n\nAs an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.\nBack then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.\nOver the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.\nBut the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.\nShe puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".\n\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"\nWith an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop. \n\"I stepped away from the icon. It ends with love.\"\nTop image credit: Interscope",

If I fail I'm incredibly depressed for about a day.\n\"Often if I'm wearing a jumper or a jacket I've got to take it off because I start to sweat. So the head in hands, that's genuine, it's very, very authentic, I'm not putting it on for effect.\n\"I always start with where people grew up and where they went to school, and how old they are.\n\"The stats have proven it doesn't always work. But that's where I begin.\"\nJames and Robins have worked together for more than a decade - firstly on XFM and now for the BBC - but have been friends for much longer.\n\"It's quite an interesting thing to observe because it's obviously a very natural interaction for Welsh people,\" said Robins, from Bristol.\n\"I watch Elis connecting thinking 'is this really happening every week?' and it is. It's on national radio.\"\nBut why is it happening? \nDr Martin Graff, a psychologist at the University of South Wales, believes \"we all want to meet people who have a degree of familiarity to ourselves\".\n\"In Wales there's three million of us \u2013 we're a fairly exclusive club. Therefore when we meet someone Welsh it's kind of thrilling.\n\"From an evolutionary angle, meeting someone who is familiar makes them more predictable.\n\"If people's behaviour is more predictable we feel safer in their company.\"\nBorn and bred in Bridgend, I couldn't finish my interview without putting James to the test - could he find a Cymru Connection with me?\nRobins, who acts as adjudicator, declared in advance that mutual BBC colleagues did not count.\nDespite that, after roughly 45 seconds, James managed to name somebody he knew who was in the year above me at school.\nJob done - our very own Cymru Connection.",

I want to go on and create a great legacy,\" said Price.\nThere is uncertainty surrounding Jonas' career, though, as the fine run in the twilight of the Liverpudlian's career is halted.\nJonas - a two-weight world champion - loses for the third time in 19 pro bouts and suggested she could call time.\n\"It's something I'll look at when I go home,\" she said. \"Right now I'm going to go home and spend some time with my daughter.\"\nDubois retains title with points win against Shin\nRelive Price's classy points win over Jonas\nThe raucous atmosphere was at odds with the regal 5,272-capacity auditorium, which has hosted British boxing since 1918 and was about 80% full. \nThe crowd, split quite equally between men and women, sat in plush, cushioned seats to enjoy the theatre of boxing.\nPrice, in all black, made her ring walk first to a huge chorus of boos drowned out by Welsh folk song Yma o Hyd, which blared out of the sound system.\nThe trailblazing Jonas - the first ever British female to box at an Olympics - rather fittingly entered to Extraordinary Being by Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Beyonce's Run the World (Girls).\nIn the dressing room before the fight, trainer Joe Gallagher drilled into Jonas how to deal with Price's burst of punches, but 'Miss GB' struggled with her opponent's speed from the outset.\nJonas was backed on to the ropes in the second, felt the power of a counter left, then stumbled when caught by a right.\nPrice bounced confidently on her toes and continued to assert dominance as Jonas missed wildly. \nAs her sister, footballer Nikita Parris, watching on with some of her England team-mates, plus TV celebrities including presenters Romesh Ranganathan and Stacey Dooley, Jonas began to let her hands go in the fifth.\nThe success was short lived. A sensational right hand sent Jonas' head spinning in the seventh.\n\"You've got to throw some punches, love,\" trainer Gallagher told Jonas. It all felt a little too late as the result became increasingly inevitable.\nThose sitting in the second tier and gallery had a breathtaking bird's-eye view of the action as Jonas hit the canvas in the ninth after a slip.\nPrice continued to pick Jonas apart until the final seconds.\nJonas had not tasted defeat since 2021 before losing to Price\nPrice became Wales' first ever female world champion when she beat Jessica McCaskill last year.\nLess than a year later, she is one win away from unifying the division. A win over American Mayer would introduce Price to a global audience, while an all-British showdown with Derby's Ryan could headline a UK show.\n\"I want to follow in the footsteps of Katie Taylor - I'm Welsh, I'm an Olympic champion, I've got a nation behind me,\" she said.\nJonas, meanwhile, has achieved so much in the sport, but after a long, arduous career now could be the time to hang up the gloves.\nShe is a fantastic and articulate pundit, manages young fighters and has also helped trainer Gallagher in the corner.\nWith all her experience and knowledge of the sport, she will be an integral part of British boxing - in whatever capacity - for years to come.\nThis video can not be played\nWhen Lauren Price met The Prince of Wales\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

But I don't have any evidence,\" she told the BBC in January, when she also talked about the shock of being shown those pictures by police for the first time. \nThe heated courtroom exchanges between Ms Darian and her father were some of the most dramatic in the 16-week trial that shocked France and the world. \"I never touched you, never,\" Pelicot pleaded to his daughter during one session. \"You are lying!\" Ms Darian shouted back.\nMs Darian has previously said she felt she was the trial's \"forgotten victim\" as, unlike in her mother's case, there was no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted upon her.\nShe told Elle France earlier this week that the charges she is pressing against her father were \"symbolic\" but \"in line with what I have said since the start: that I am a victim of chemical submission [drug-facilitated assault] but was never recognised as such\".\nShe has hired lawyer Florence Rault to represent her.\nFor many years, Ms Rault has been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s. \nOne, a young property agent known by the pseudonym Marion, was the victim of an attempted rape in 1999, to which Pelicot has admitted. \nThe other - also an estate agent in her 20s - was raped and murdered in 1991. Pelicot is currently being investigated over that case, but has always denied any involvement.\nMs Darian said she saw similarities between her and Marion. \"We look strangely alike. She is blonde, her hair is bobbed, we were born the same year... I wanted to meet her lawyer and hear all the details,\" she told Elle France.\nIn her police complaint, which was quoted by French media, Ms Rault lamented that Ms Darian had never been offered gynecological examinations nor had she been tested for the drugs Pelicot used on his wife. \nMs Rault said the investigation had only focused on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and that her client had been treated as a \"peripheral victim\". She asked the authorities to launch a fresh \"serious and in-depth\" inquiry.\nB\u00e9atrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, told French media that Ms Darian's decision to press charges was \"unsurprising given her statements and beliefs during the Avignon trial\".\nShe also said that the prosecutors in Avignon, in south-eastern France, said there were insufficient \"objective elements\" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on his daughter.\n\nForty-nine men were sentenced in December alongside Dominque Pelicot. All were found guilty of at least one charge - rape or sexual assault - against Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. \nSeventeen initially said they would appeal the charges against them, but seven of those have since changed their minds. \nThose who decide to press ahead with their appeals will go on trial at the end of the year in N\u00eemes, southern France.\nThe first trial - which lasted from September to December 2024 - garnered worldwide attention thanks to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",

        "article_text": "Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman died of natural causes about a week after his wife Betsy Arakawa, who died after contracting a rare virus, a New Mexico medical investigator has said.\nHackman, 95, died at his Santa Fe home from coronary artery disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease a contributing factor.\nMs Arakawa, 65, died in the same house from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Her cause of death was listed as natural. \nAuthorities believe she passed away about seven days before her husband, to whom she had been married for more than 30 years. During his career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.\nIt is likely that Ms Arakawa died first on 11 February, Dr Heather Jarrell of the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office told a news conference on Friday.\nShe said it was \"reasonable to conclude\" that Hackman had died on 18 February.\nMs Arakawa's last known movements and correspondence were on 11 February, when she was seen going to a grocery store, a CVS pharmacy and a pet store, before returning home in the early evening.\nGiven that Hackman was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", said Dr Jarrell. \nShe told reporters she was \"not aware of his normal daily functioning capability\".\nHackman had \"significant heart disease, and ultimately that's what resulted in his death\", Dr Jarrell said, adding that he had had chronic high blood pressure. \nHe had not eaten anything recently, but had shown no indications of dehydration, she added.\nAt the news conference, New Mexico Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps emphasised that hantavirus infections were extremely rare. \nHPS is transmitted through contact with rodent droppings, urine or saliva, often when contaminated dust is inhaled. \nShe noted that 136 cases had been reported in the state over the past 50 years, with 42% resulting in fatalities.\nDr Phipps said evidence of rodent activity had been found in some buildings on the property, though the risk inside the main house was considered \"low\".\nInvestigators are trying to determine how Ms Arakawa contracted the illness. Hackman tested negative for hantavirus.\nThe couple were found in their home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through the window.\nThe remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition.\nHackman's body was in a sideroom next to the kitchen, with a walking cane and a pair of sunglasses nearby, according to a search warrant affidavit. \nMs Arakawa's body was in the bathroom, with scattered pills close to her.\nSheriff's deputies found medication for thyroid and blood pressure treatment, along with pain reliever Tylenol, according to a court-filed inventory.  \nCiting privacy laws, authorities did not disclose who had been prescribed the drugs. \nOne of the couple's three dogs was also found dead inside a crate near Ms Arakawa, while the other two dogs were alive.\nThe cause of death for the dog is yet to be determined, officials say. Dr Phipps told reporters that dogs did not get sick from hantavirus.\nInitial investigations found no signs of forced entry or foul play at the couple's $3.8m (\u00a33m) home. Tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative, and no significant gas leaks were detected.\nHackman is survived by three adult children from his previous marriage.\nHackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.\nHe won best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.\nA relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman saw his breakthrough come in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.\nBoth films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing an FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.\nHe played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.\nHackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.\nHis last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico.",

        "article_text": "Fighting back the tears, 22-year-old rubbish collector Okuku Prince recalls the moment his best friend's lifeless body was found at a massive rubbish dump in Uganda's capital, Kampala.\nThe landslide at the Kiteezi dump last August killed 30 people, including his friend Sanya Kezia.\n\"I think some people are still underneath the garbage,\" he tells the BBC.\nMany of them eked out a living by washing and selling whatever discarded items they found that still had value - anything from fishing nets to plastic bottles, glass jars and the components of old electronic devices.\nA blame-game erupted after the fatal collapse, with Kampala's city council and central government accusing each other of negligence, while some of the dead still languished under tonnes of rubbish without the dignity of a burial.\nWhen government tractors did eventually dig up Kezia's body, there were injuries to the 21-year-old's face.\nIt was horrifying for his friend to see him enveloped by stinking, rotting waste.\n\"We're not safe here. Unless they [repair] it, maybe level it. Otherwise, people are not safe,\" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.\nUnable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.\nYouth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.\n\"I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,\" says Mr Prince. \"I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or \u00a32.10] a day.\"\nThe collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.\nThe houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.\nCompensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.\nOfficials are \"waiting for the valuation and budget allocation\", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).\nSome argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.\n\"You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,\" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.\nThe Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.\nAs Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.\nOn the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still. \nBirds of prey can be seen flying overhead.\nThe city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.\nBut the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.\n\"With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,\" Mr Muramuzi explains.\n\"Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.\"\nYet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.\nHad that already been in place, \"the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided\", he says.\nSo, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?\nThe answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.\nUltimate responsibility for keeping Kampala \"clean, habitable, and sustainable environment\" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.\nThe KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.\n\"All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid\u2026 but their capacity is very limited,\" the Kampala mayor said recently.\n\"If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.\"\nThere is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.\nIt did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were \"found to be responsible\".\nA month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.\nJames Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.\nAt present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce \"unnecessary waste\" coming into the city.\nBut they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.\n\"We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,\" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.\n\"If you sort, waste has different destinations. If you mix, it all goes to one - the landfill.\"\nExperts say such initiatives are important but do not address the bigger structural inadequacies at Kiteezi.\nAnd for people whose lives have been shattered by recent events there, it is too little too late.\n\"They promised us compensation, but I haven't received anything - almost everyone is complaining too,\" Mr Prince tells the BBC.\n\"We lost our friend. All that transpired in the process was sorrow.\"\nAdditional reporting and editing by Natasha Booty.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

This feels personal, not like some abstract foreign policy tactic.\"\nSoren has not given up all hope though.\n\"It's my hope and my prayer that I will one day be able to put [the flag] back on the wall,\" he confides.\nThere's no sign his prayers will be answered soon.\nGreenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, goes to the polls next week with all the main parties backing independence at some point in the future.\nA takeover by Donald Trump \u2013 potentially by force \u2013 is not on the ballot paper.\nNot far from the royal palace stands Denmark's memorial to its soldiers lost in recent battle.\nCarved on the stone-covered walls are the names of those killed alongside their Western allies.\nThe section honouring the fallen in the US-led invasion of Afghanistan is particularly sizeable.\nDenmark lost 44 soldiers in Afghanistan, which as a proportion of its less than six million population, was more than any other ally apart from the US.

And I think we need a policeman to ensure international law and order but if the United States does not want to execute that role, then Europe must be able to defend itself, to stand on its own feet.\"\nFogh Rasmussen doesn't though believe the policeman is about to turn felon.\n\"I would like to stress I don't think at the end of the day that the Americans will take Greenland by force.\"\nPresident Trump first talked about a Greenland takeover in his first term of office before returning to the theme at the start of this year.\nBut now, after blindsiding supposed allies with his latest moves on Ukraine, tariffs, as well as the Middle East, Denmark is urgently trying the assess the true threat.\nFor many younger Danes, control of Greenland is plain wrong - an unfathomable colonial hangover.\nIt doesn't mean they want it handed straight over the US instead.\n\"We do have connections to Greenland,\" says music student Molly. \"Denmark and Greenland are quite separated I would say but I still have friends from there so this does affect me quite personally.\"\n\"I find it really scary,\" says 18-year-old music student Luukas.\n\"Everything he sees, he goes after. And the thing with the oil and money, he doesn't care about the climate, he doesn't care about anyone or anything.\"\nHis friend Clara chips in that Trump is now so powerful he can \"affect their day-to-day life\" from thousands of miles away, in what is an era of unprecedented jeopardy.\nIn light of President Trump's suspension of military aid for Ukraine and his deep reluctance to fund Europe's security, Denmark has been at the heart of the drive to boost defence spending across the continent.\nThe country has just announced it will allocate more than 3% of its GDP to defence spending in 2025 and 2026 to protect against future aggression from Russia or elsewhere.\nMeanwhile, security analyst Hans Tino Hansen stands in front of a huge screen in what he calls his \"ops room\", at his Copenhagen headquarters.\n\"This map is where we update on a daily basis our threat picture based on alerts and incidents all over the world,\" says Hans, who has been running Risk Intelligence for the past 25 years.\nAs part of Denmark's increased defence spending, it's bolstering its strength in the \"High North\" with an extra two billion euros announced in January and three new Arctic naval vessels and investment in long-range drones.\nHans believes Arctic security can be tightened further, not by an American takeover - but with new deals that restore US influence.\n\"If you make more agreements, both on defence and security, but also economic ones and on raw materials, then we are more or less going back to where we were in the 50s and 60s.\"\nBut the story stretches further back than the mid-20th Century.\n\"If you look at this globe, Greenland is the most centrally located place on Earth,\" says world-renowned geologist Prof Minik Rosing, gesticulating in his wood-panelled office.\nThe serenity of his room reflects the temperament of a man who grew up in a settlement of just \"seven or eight people\" in the Nuuk fjord of the island.\nBut a key reason his homeland is now coming under increasing scrutiny from outsiders is the rich mineral deposits beneath the Arctic ice.\nWe've seen how Ukraine's natural resources have caught President Trump's eye in much the same way.\n\"All these minerals that they talk about like rare metals, rare earth elements - they are actually not rare. What is rare is the use of them,\" he reasons.\nProf Rosing says the vastness of Greenland and the lack of infrastructure are just two elements why the island may not be the cashpoint some Americans are hoping for.\n\"They are a minuscule part of the mining industry and the economy of extracting them is very uncertain, whereas the investment to start extracting is very high. The risk of the investment is too high relative to the potential gain.\"\nThe current Greenlandic government says there will be a vote on independence at some point following next week's election.\nAlthough surely unintentional, President Trump's designs on the island have shone a light on a desire found among the Inuit to finally break free from 300 years of Danish control.\nBut Prof Rosing believes, despite all the latent mineral wealth, his fellow Greenlanders are in no hurry to forego the annual block grant of the equivalent of \u00a3480m (\u20ac570m) it receives from Copenhagen.\nThis accounts for easily more than half of the island's public budget.\n\"People talk about health services, schools, the next outboard engine they want on their boat and what is the price of gas and all of these things that normal people do,\" he says.\n\"It's not like they stand up with a big knife, wave it in the air and shout independence, independence.\"\nIn terms of Trump's apparent obsession with taking Greenland, Fogh Rasmussen fears there may be a troubling conclusion to be drawn.\nOne that would render the Danes unable to do business with a man whose view on territorial integrity is so wildly incompatible from theirs.\n\"I understand very well the American strategic interest in the minerals, but when it comes to mining in Greenland, they have shown no interest,\" he says.\n\"That leaves me with the concern that maybe it's not about security, maybe it's not about minerals, maybe it is just a question of expanding the territory of the United States.\n\"And that's actually a point where we are not able to accommodate President Trump.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kostas Kallergis",

        "article_text": "Which Premier League boss makes most substitutions - and who does it best?\nAs managers bemoan the lack of preparation time in between games, the use of substitutions has grown in importance.\nSince the pandemic, Premier League bosses have been able to use up to five substitutes spread over three occasions in order to cope with injuries, manage player workload and turn games in their favour.\nBBC Sport has crunched the numbers to find out which teams turn to the bench most and least often, whose substitutions have the biggest impact and what this reveals about that team's style of play.\nBrighton's Fabian Hurzeler uses the most substitutions, with 130 out of a possible 135 at an average of 4.8 per game. This is remarkably similar to his predecessor Roberto de Zerbi, who made 4.6 per match.\nLast season, Brighton were seeking to avoid injuries while balancing a maiden season in the Europa League.\nHowever, as Europe's second biggest spenders last summer, Albion now have a plethora of wingers to turn to off the bench and are not afraid to use them, making all five changes in 80% of their games.\nThe majority tend to come late in matches, as Hurzeler shuffles his attacking wingers to have another go at a full-back if his first choice has not been successful or is tiring.\nIt is interesting that two clubs in the relegation zone - Southampton and Ipswich Town - are in the top five for most substitutions made, with the majority coming early in games, either at half-time or shortly after the break.\nThis is because both teams have regularly gone behind in matches and found themselves in need of a quick change to try to find a solution.\nAt the other end of the scale, just like last season, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola barely makes substitutions. \nIn 2023-24 when City won the league, Guardiola averaged three subs per game. That was justified with City rarely needing to alter a winning machine - but, despite more obvious problems this season, he still only makes an average of 3.3 substitutions per match.\nIn a similar vein, Enzo Maresca's Chelsea are in the bottom six for the number of changes made.\nDespite boasting a large squad, Maresca has stubbornly stuck to his tactical plan and personnel, even with the Blues only winning three of their past 12 fixtures.\nIt seems as though Maresca and his former boss Guardiola are determined to stick with the players they have, perhaps in the name of building sides as Guardiola rebuilds his next City team and Maresca seeks to nail down his preferred XI.\nMeanwhile, Everton's use of the fewest number of subs is likely down to a lack of options off the bench as well as previous manager Sean Dyche's pragmatic approach to holding what they had.\nWith the most draws in the league, their changes have been made to consolidate a point rather than chase three - while their resources have not given them much of a choice.\nBrighton, Fulham and Bournemouth are three of the most active at making substitutions - and it has paid off, with them all featuring in the top four for goal involvements by replacements.\nIndeed, Bournemouth have produced the most goals from the bench with four different players (Justin Kluivert, Dango Ouattara, Enes Unal and David Brooks) scoring two goals each.\nAndoni Iraola has used his substitutes effectively to send on fresh players that can pick up the Cherries' intensity out of possession and replace any exhausted from their high-octane pressing style.\nAt Craven Cottage, Marco Silva has been rewarded with 11 goals by substitutes this season, with Rodrigo Muniz and Harry Wilson contributing eight off the bench.\nArsenal round off the top four for goal involvements by replacements, but none of their nine has been scored by a centre-forward, perhaps indicative of what they are missing.\nBy contrast, title rivals Liverpool have five goals from their two 'super-sub' strikers Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez.\nCuriously, former Leicester City manager Steve Cooper has the best subs-to-goal ratio with his 46 changes in 12 games bringing four goals. That is 16% of Leicester City's goals in total.\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, since Ruben Amorim's arrival, Manchester United have had only one substitution result in a goal involvement - Christian Eriksen's assist against Southampton in January.\nAs for the Saints, despite being one of the teams that make the most substitutions, they have only produced one goal off the bench since Ivan Juric's arrival, the same as Gary O'Neil managed at Wolves and Dyche at Everton before both were replaced.\nRather surprisingly, Eddie Howe's Newcastle and Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace have scored just one more goal through substitutes than the teams mentioned above and the same as Ipswich Town. This suggests a lack of depth in both squads and an over-reliance on the first XI.\nIn spite of this, Newcastle United have gained the most points in the Premier League from losing positions, suggesting Howe's changes are more suited to adding bite in midfield rather than attacking verve.\nIt is unlikely to be a coincidence that proactive teams who risk more by making a higher number of substitutions affect games late on.\nGiven the regression of certain elite teams and increasing confidence of sides below them, it makes for a fiercely competitive league.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "summary": "That was justified with City rarely needing to alter a winning machine - but, despite more obvious problems this season, he still only makes an average of 3.3 substitutions per match.In a similar vein, Enzo Maresca's Chelsea are in the bottom six for the number of changes made.Despite boasting a large squad, Maresca has stubbornly stuck to his tactical plan and personnel, even with the Blues only winning three of their past 12 fixtures.It seems as though Maresca and his former boss Guardiola are determined to stick with the players they have, perhaps in the name of building sides as Guardiola rebuilds his next City team and Maresca seeks to nail down his preferred XI.Meanwhile, Everton's use of the fewest number of subs is likely down to a lack of options off the bench as well as previous manager Sean Dyche's pragmatic approach to holding what they had.With the most draws in the league, their changes have been made to consolidate a point rather than chase three - while their resources have not given them much of a choice.Whose substitutes have made the most goal contributions?Brighton, Fulham and Bournemouth are three of the most active at making substitutions - and it has paid off, with them all featuring in the top four for goal involvements by replacements.Indeed, Bournemouth have produced the most goals from the bench with four different players (Justin Kluivert, Dango Ouattara, Enes Unal and David Brooks) scoring two goals each.Andoni Iraola has used his substitutes effectively to send on fresh players that can pick up the Cherries' intensity out of possession and replace any exhausted from their high-octane pressing style.At Craven Cottage, Marco Silva has been rewarded with 11 goals by substitutes this season, with Rodrigo Muniz and Harry Wilson contributing eight off the bench.Arsenal round off the top four for goal involvements by replacements, but none of their nine has been scored by a centre-forward, perhaps indicative of what they are missing.By contrast, title rivals Liverpool have five goals from their two 'super-sub' strikers Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez.Image source, BBC SportCuriously, former Leicester City manager Steve Cooper has the best subs-to-goal ratio with his 46 changes in 12 games bringing four goals. Which Premier League boss makes most substitutions - and who does it best?Published7 March 2025Image source, BBC SportDharnish IqbalFootball tactics writerAs managers bemoan the lack of preparation time in between games, the use of substitutions has grown in importance.Since the pandemic, Premier League bosses have been able to use up to five substitutes spread over three occasions in order to cope with injuries, manage player workload and turn games in their favour.BBC Sport has crunched the numbers to find out which teams turn to the bench most and least often, whose substitutions have the biggest impact and what this reveals about that team's style of play.Who uses the bench the most and least?Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler uses the most substitutions, with 130 out of a possible 135 at an average of 4.8 per game. This is remarkably similar to his predecessor Roberto de Zerbi, who made 4.6 per match.Last season, Brighton were seeking to avoid injuries while balancing a maiden season in the Europa League.However, as Europe's second biggest spenders last summer, Albion now have a plethora of wingers to turn to off the bench and are not afraid to use them, making all five changes in 80% of their games.The majority tend to come late in matches, as Hurzeler shuffles his attacking wingers to have another go at a full-back if his first choice has not been successful or is tiring.It is interesting that two clubs in the relegation zone - Southampton and Ipswich Town - are in the top five for most substitutions made, with the majority coming early in games, either at half-time or shortly after the break.This is because both teams have regularly gone behind in matches and found themselves in need of a quick change to try to find a solution.At the other end of the scale, just like last season, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola barely makes substitutions. In 2023-24 when City won the league, Guardiola averaged three subs per game. That is 16% of Leicester City's goals in total.At the opposite end of the spectrum, since Ruben Amorim's arrival, Manchester United have had only one substitution result in a goal involvement - Christian Eriksen's assist against Southampton in January.As for the Saints, despite being one of the teams that make the most substitutions, they have only produced one goal off the bench since Ivan Juric's arrival, the same as Gary O'Neil managed at Wolves and Dyche at Everton before both were replaced.Rather surprisingly, Eddie Howe's Newcastle and Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace have scored just one more goal through substitutes than the teams mentioned above and the same as Ipswich Town.",

Unless they [repair] it, maybe level it. Otherwise, people are not safe,\" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.\nUnable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.\nYouth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.\n\"I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,\" says Mr Prince. \"I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or \u00a32.10] a day.\"\nThe collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.\nThe houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.\nCompensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.\nOfficials are \"waiting for the valuation and budget allocation\", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).\nSome argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.\n\"You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,\" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.\nThe Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.\nAs Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.\nOn the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still. \nBirds of prey can be seen flying overhead.\nThe city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.\nBut the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.\n\"With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,\" Mr Muramuzi explains.\n\"Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.\"\nYet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.\nHad that already been in place, \"the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided\", he says.\nSo, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?\nThe answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.\nUltimate responsibility for keeping Kampala \"clean, habitable, and sustainable environment\" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.\nThe KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.\n\"All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid\u2026 but their capacity is very limited,\" the Kampala mayor said recently.\n\"If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.\"\nThere is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.\nIt did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were \"found to be responsible\".\nA month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.\nJames Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.\nAt present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce \"unnecessary waste\" coming into the city.\nBut they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.\n\"We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,\" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.\n\"If you sort, waste has different destinations. If you mix, it all goes to one - the landfill.\"\nExperts say such initiatives are important but do not address the bigger structural inadequacies at Kiteezi.\nAnd for people whose lives have been shattered by recent events there, it is too little too late.\n\"They promised us compensation, but I haven't received anything - almost everyone is complaining too,\" Mr Prince tells the BBC.\n\"We lost our friend.

        "article_text": "Canada's governing Liberal Party will announce on Sunday who will take over from Justin Trudeau as leader, after a crucial vote that will change the face of Canadian politics.\nAbout 140,000 of the party's members have been voting for their preferred candidate, with results expected to be announced around 18:00 EDT (22:00 GMT).\nThe new leader will become the country's prime minister. But because the Liberals are a minority government, holding onto the top job will require winning a general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nWhoever replaces Trudeau will have to grapple with US President Donald Trump's threats against Canada, which include an escalating trade war and repeated calls to make the country the US's \"51st state\".\nThe issue has dominated the campaigns of all four candidates vying for the top job. Here's what to know about them.\nFormer Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney has pitched himself as a strong fiscal manager who can help countries navigate challenging times, including his own.\n\"I've helped manage multiple crises, and I've helped save two economies,\" he said in his campaign launch speech.\nWidely seen as the frontrunner for the job, he's sought to position himself as the man who can steer the country through the fallout caused by Trump's tariffs.\n\"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills,\" he said during a leadership debate last month.\nThe 59-year-old was born in Canada's Northwest Territories and grew up in Edmonton, Alberta. \nHe has sought to highlight his Canadian roots and paint himself as a political outsider. \nHe has served in recent months as a special economics adviser to Trudeau, and has long been considered a contender for the top job, though the Harvard graduate has never held public office.\nTrudeau himself admitted that he had long been trying to recruit Carney to his team.\nCarney tried to distance himself from the unpopular PM, saying he is \"not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the prime minister and his team let their attention wander from the economy too often\". Trudeau's approval ratings have however improved since Trump's return to office. \nCarney brings with him expertise on environmental matters through his role as the United Nations special envoy on climate action, recently calling the goal of net zero \"the greatest commercial opportunity of our time\".\nHe is a champion of some Liberal policies that have been unpopular, like the federal carbon tax, the party's signature climate policy that critics argue is a financial burden for Canadians.\nHe has recently backed away from the policy, saying in May that it had \"served a purpose up until now\".\nHe has received a number of cabinet endorsements, including Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault and Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly.\nThe Toronto member of parliament became one of the most well-known members of Trudeau's team.\nWhile she had long been seen as a trusted senior official in his inner circle, a rift with the prime minister's office led to her recent abrupt resignation in December. \nThat was a blow to Trudeau's already-shaky hold on power, helping to usher in his own resignation.\nThe two disagreed on how to address President Trump's threat of tariffs, among other financial policies as Canada faced a C$60bn deficit ($42bn; \u00a333bn).\nBorn to a Ukrainian mother in the western province of Alberta, the 56-year-old was a journalist before entering politics.\nShe entered the House of Commons in 2013 and two years later joined Trudeau's cabinet with a trade brief after he swept the party to power.\nAs Minister of Foreign Affairs she helped Canada renegotiate a free trade deal with the US and Mexico. \nShe was later named deputy prime minister and minister of finance and oversaw Canada's financial response to the Covid pandemic.\nA 2019 Globe and Mail profile said depending who you asked, Freeland is either a last, best hope for the liberal world order or an out-of-touch idealist.\nHer steadfast support of Ukraine earned praise in some quarters but the Harvard-educated MP has had her share of critics, including Trump who recently called her \"toxic\".\nIn her launch - walking onto the stage to the 1982 song, Maneater - she leaned into her time renegotiating a trade deal under the first Trump administration, and said she would take on the president again.\n\"I will lead a true Canadian response to the threat we now face. We will be united, we will be strong, we will be smart and that's why we will win,\" she told the crowd of supporters. \nShe has received the backing of Health Minister Mark Holland and Justice Minister Arif Virani, among other MPs. \nKarina Gould, a former trade and investment specialist, has thrown her hat in the ring, declaring she would represent a \"new generation\" if elected. \nShe was first elected in 2015 and has served a number of roles in Trudeau's cabinet - the youngest woman to serve as a minister in Canada. \nThe 37-year-old was families minister, international development minister and later Minister of Democratic Institutions, before taking on her current role as House Leader, where she oversees the government's legislative agenda.\nGould launched her bid by saying \"Canadians have lost trust in our party\".\nShe has taken aim at the US when trying to convince voters to choose her as leader, telling CNBC \"trust has been broken\" between Canada and its southern neighbour.\nShe said fentanyl, one of Trump's justifications for imposing tariffs, comes from Canada in \"miniscule amounts.\"\n\"But if that's what he cares about,\" she said, referring to the US president, \"well then let's put together an inspection team at the border to inspect every truck that goes south for fentanyl and every truck that comes north for illegal guns\".\nFrank Baylis, a former Liberal member of parliament, was the first out of the gate to announce he is seeking the leadership of the party. \nHe has said he will bring his experience from the world of business to address the affordability and cost-of-living challenges facing Canadians. \nBaylis is the executive chairman of a medical device company that was founded by his mother and where he later served as president. It was sold to a US firm in 2021. He is an engineer by training.\nBaylis served in parliament from 2015-2019 and was a founding member of the Parliamentary Black Caucus. \nHe has been heavily critical of Trudeau's approach to Trump's tariff threats and has claimed he would deal with Trump better than his opponents, casting his outsider experience as a businessman as a strength.\n\"Whether we like it or not, the Americans have put as a president a highly aggressive bully of a man, who's a businessman,\" he told The Canadian Press. \"And people coming from a genteel world of bureaucrats or banking, they're not going to know how to deal with this character,\" he said, taking aim at his opponents.\nMany prominent cabinet ministers chose not to run in this race, including Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, who all said they need to focus on their current duties.\nJaime Battiste, a member of parliament (MP) from the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, dropped out earlier in the race.\nAnother hopeful, former Toronto area MP Ruby Dhalla, was kicked out of the race over \"extremely serious\" violations, the party said. Those include allegations of inaccuracies in her campaign's financial reporting. Ms Dhalla has appealed the decision. ",

I want to go on and create a great legacy,\" said Price.\nThere is uncertainty surrounding Jonas' career, though, as the fine run in the twilight of the Liverpudlian's career is halted.\nJonas - a two-weight world champion - loses for the third time in 19 pro bouts and suggested she could call time.\n\"It's something I'll look at when I go home,\" she said. \"Right now I'm going to go home and spend some time with my daughter.\"\nThis video can not be played\nLauren Price improved her pro record to 9-0, with her last defeat in the amateurs in 2018\nDubois retains title with points win against Shin\nRelive Price's classy points win over Jonas\nThe raucous atmosphere was at odds with the regal 5,272-capacity auditorium, which has hosted British boxing since 1918 and was about 80% full. \nThe crowd, split quite equally between men and women, sat in plush, cushioned seats to enjoy the theatre of boxing.\nPrice, in all black, made her ring walk first to a huge chorus of boos drowned out by Welsh folk song Yma o Hyd, which blared out of the sound system.\nThe trailblazing Jonas - the first ever British female to box at an Olympics - rather fittingly entered to Extraordinary Being by Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Beyonce's Run the World (Girls).\nIn the dressing room before the fight, trainer Joe Gallagher drilled into Jonas how to deal with Price's burst of punches, but 'Miss GB' struggled with her opponent's speed from the outset.\nJonas was backed on to the ropes in the second, felt the power of a counter left, then stumbled when caught by a right.\nPrice bounced confidently on her toes and continued to assert dominance as Jonas missed wildly. \nAs her sister, footballer Nikita Parris, watching on with some of her England team-mates, plus TV celebrities including presenters Romesh Ranganathan and Stacey Dooley, Jonas began to let her hands go in the fifth.\nThe success was short lived. A sensational right hand sent Jonas' head spinning in the seventh.\n\"You've got to throw some punches, love,\" trainer Gallagher told Jonas. It all felt a little too late as the result became increasingly inevitable.\nThose sitting in the second tier and gallery had a breathtaking bird's-eye view of the action as Jonas hit the canvas in the ninth after a slip.\nPrice continued to pick Jonas apart until the final seconds.\nPrice became Wales' first ever female world champion when she beat Jessica McCaskill last year.\nLess than a year later, she is one win away from unifying the division. A win over American Mayer would introduce Price to a global audience, while an all-British showdown with Derby's Ryan could headline a UK show.\n\"I want to follow in the footsteps of Katie Taylor - I'm Welsh, I'm an Olympic champion, I've got a nation behind me,\" she said.\nJonas, meanwhile, has achieved so much in the sport, but after a long, arduous career now could be the time to hang up the gloves.\nShe is a fantastic and articulate pundit, manages young fighters and has also helped trainer Gallagher in the corner.\nWith all her experience and knowledge of the sport, she will be an integral part of British boxing - in whatever capacity - for years to come.\nJonas had not tasted defeat since 2021 before losing to Price\nThis video can not be played\nWhen Lauren Price met The Prince of Wales\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Watching her fights previously with the team, that's what she does. Charges in, head down and swings. She did exactly what I expected,\" Dubois told Sky Sports.\n\"I feel like I need to learn how to fight on the inside. It's one thing doing it in sparring, but it's another thing doing it in the ring.

        "article_text": "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.\nBut the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.\nThe technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly. \nMask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?\nThe LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.\nAccording to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).\n\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.\nA recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.\nUS space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.\nSince then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.\nBut at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.\nThe main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.\nDr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.\n\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.\n\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.\nSkincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.\nThis is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.\nDr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.\n\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.\n\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.\nWhen you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.\nNatalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.\nThe skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"\nShe adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.\nO'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.\n\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.\nPart of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.\nLaurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.\nHe started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.\n\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.\nNewman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.\nNewman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.\nHe emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.\nDr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.\n\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds. \n\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".\nHe says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.\nDr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

        "article_text": "Football fans - including Manchester United supporters at Old Trafford last weekend - have protested against rising ticket prices this season\nFootball fans can be tribal. But when it comes to ticket prices, there is unity.\n\"We are all fighting the same fight on ticket prices,\" said Manchester United Supporters' Trust CEO Duncan Drasdo.\n\"Clubs are exploiting loyalty and fans are united in saying enough is enough.\"\nWhen 19 of the Premier League's 20 clubs raised their ticket prices before the 2024-25 season, the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) launched a campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty'.\nThose protests have grown again this season, with some clubs removing concessionary discounts for the elderly and young people - and teams like Arsenal announcing increases for 2025-26.\nThe cost of competing for trophies, increasing operational expenses, and the threat of complying with financial regulations, have all been given as reasons for price hikes.\nBBC Sport has analysed a new Uefa report showing the league's financial power and how much clubs make from tickets - but also the challenge of increased staffing levels and expensive running costs.\nThis video can not be played\nArsenal fan Laura Kirk-Francis outlines her disappointment over ticket price hikes\nPremier League clubs made a total of almost 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) from selling tickets to home matches in 2023, Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report shows.\nThat figure is growing by about 10% per year, and is almost double that of Spain's  La Liga (\u00a3481m) and Germany's Bundesliga (\u00a3430m).\nThe report uses a mixture of full financial reporting of more than 700 clubs for 2023, plus 2024 figures from 130 of Europe's biggest clubs.\nOf the 10 clubs who generated the most income from gate receipts in 2024, six are English.\nThe same six Premier League clubs feature in the top 12 for another ticketing metric, which measures the money earned per fan, per ticket.\n\"What the figures show is that English top-flight clubs are doing very well financially in a whole number of different metrics,\" says Tom Greatrex, chair of the FSA.\n\"Healthy ticket revenue shows people are wanting to go - but also shows the ratcheting up of ticket prices in the past few years. That is manifesting itself in the protests and disenchantment we've seen.\"\nThe report also points out that \"stadium expansions and/or increases in premium seating and hospitality have also doubled gate revenues at Paris St-Germain, Bayern [Munich], Liverpool and Manchester City since 2009\".\nArsenal and Tottenham's positions are helped by sales of high-value hospitality seats at modern stadiums in London - one of the world's most-visited cities.\n\"What we have seen clubs do through stadium expansion is a huge focus on those seats being hospitality,\" says Dan Plumley, senior lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University. \n\"On a basic financial level it makes sense, because you can generate more from that than a baseline seat. \n\"But if that is stopping your more average fan getting a ticket, that is something clubs are going to have to grapple with.\"\nThe report states the average amount made per fan from tickets is \u00a329-\u00a337 \"for the majority of clubs\".\nFans from four rival clubs to protest at ticket prices\nMan Utd fans criticise ticket prices - as club reveals manager change costs\nPremier League ticket price rises - what the fans think\nThis video can not be played\nOne Manchester United fan explains why protests are planned\nThe Uefa report paints a similar picture to other research such as the annual Deloitte Money League - with Premier League clubs bringing in far more revenue  (\u00a36.2bn in 2023) than other European leagues.\nHowever, English clubs reported a combined loss of \u00a3728m before tax.\nTV rights deals are showing signs of plateauing, so clubs need to maximise matchday income and commercial and sponsorship revenues to try to offset significant spending on transfers, wages and running costs in order to turn a profit.\nThe report outlines some eye-watering spending figures:\nPremier League clubs spent \u00a34bn on player wages in 2023, almost double second-placed Spain (\u00a32.1bn).\nFour European clubs have squads that cost more than 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) to assemble by the end of 2024, and all are English - Chelsea (1.7bn euros/\u00a31.4bn), Manchester City (1.3bn euros/\u00a31.1bn), Manchester United (1.1bn euros/\u00a3920m), and Arsenal (1bn euros/\u00a3840m).\nChelsea's 2024 squad was found to be \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record - the 2020 Real Madrid squad. The report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nFour of the five most profitable clubs - by pre-tax profits - in 2024 were German: Bayern (\u00a353m), Borussia Dortmund (\u00a341m), Lazio (\u00a334m), Leipzig (\u00a331m), Eintracht Frankfurt (\u00a327m).\nThree of the five least profitable clubs in 2024 - by pre-tax losses - were English: Juventus (\u00a3164m), Chelsea (\u00a393m), Aston Villa (\u00a384m), Roma (\u00a363m), Liverpool (\u00a355m).\nPlumley says: \"Each individual club will have its own reasons for doing it, but raising ticket prices doesn't shift the dial massively in terms of the overall picture of the finances.\n\"I get that costs have gone up, we understand that side of the equation, but this is where it really grinds with fans.\"\nFans of some clubs have been contesting the loss of concessionary tickets for the elderly, juniors, and disabled supporters\nManchester United's controversial plans to make up to 450 redundancies,, external cut about 39% of its workforce and \"return the club to profitability\" have put a sharper focus on how many people are actually needed to run a football club - and the operating costs involved.\nWhile transfer spending remains a club's biggest outgoing, the report says high inflation in areas such as utilities, plus the wages spent on more employees to expand commercial activity, is biting. \nOperating costs have risen by 12% across Europe, with a total of \u00a31.5bn spent in the Premier League in 2023, almost \u00a3500m higher than second-placed Germany\nOperating costs plus non-player wages absorb just under half the revenue of big-five European league clubs\nIn 2024, six Premier League teams featured in the top 10 for money spent on operating costs.\n\"Operations costs have increased - that's fair,\" Greatrex says. \"But increasing ticket prices way beyond the level of inflation, year after year, which is what has started to happen with most clubs in the Premier League - and then trying to claim that PSR or financial fair play are the reason - is the clubs treating people as though they're idiots.\"\nSalaries paid to non-footballer staff members have also risen sharply.\nThe average top 20 club in Europe has 970 full-time employees - Barcelona have the most with 1,781\nFour Premier League teams have more than 1,000 full-time employees - Man Utd, Brighton, Liverpool and Man City\nPremier League clubs employed a total of 11,081 full-time employees by the end of 2023\nEnglish top-flight clubs paid a total of \u00a31bn in non-player wages in 2023. That total, which includes wages paid to staff members such as coaches, media departments and ticket office personnel, is more than twice that of second-placed Germany\nThere was 19% inflation on non-player wages across Europe in 2023 and for the biggest clubs, head coach wages rose on average 21% in 2024\nThat compares to a more modest average growth of 4.5% in player wages in 2024, which the report said was \"essential for financial stability as clubs struggle with strong inflation\".\nThe logic behind the rise in staffing numbers varies per club. Brighton, for example, employ a notoriously vast recruitment and scouting operation.\nThe report states that employee growth can be explained by clubs' desire to wring more from commercial and sponsorship deals.\nAcross Europe, income from commercial and sponsorship deals has risen by 39% since 2019.\n\"Commercial income is almost untapped in terms of potential and there is no restriction on the number of deals you can sign,\" Plumley says. \n\"But you have to throw more resource at that.\n\"There are more roles now in football clubs than ever before. Some of them are quite forward thinking.\n\"It's a natural consequence of how the game has evolved, because everyone is pushing for growth, growth, growth.\"",

        "article_text": "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.\nAt the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.\nShe used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"\nThe nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's girlfriend Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.\nThe love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.\nAt Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.\nRapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.\nNaked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.\nAs Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"\nDior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.\nCreative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".\nThe trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".\nSheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.\nThe trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.\nCharli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"\nBut many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.\n\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.\nFashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".\nThe controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.\nAbhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\". \nThe idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.\n\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"\nIt seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.\nShock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.\nAt Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.\nThere were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.\n\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.\nHowever, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".\n\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.\nSome men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.\nIt's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'How has he done that?' - Kohli out for 11 as Phillips takes dazzling catch\nThe day before taking his latest flying catch in the Champions Trophy, New Zealand's Glenn Phillips was soaring in a different way.\nHe is training to be an aeroplane pilot and has a simulator with him in his hotel room.\n\"I'll probably fly for close to four or five hours most days,\" Phillips tells BBC Sport.\n\"The other day I did Bahrain to Dubai.\n\"Sometimes I'll do Heathrow to Manchester, other days Auckland to Christchurch.\n\"It really depends on what is floating in my boat for the day.\"\nNZ hopeful bowler Henry will be fit for India final\nTMS' Champions Trophy team of the tournament\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nPhillips also practises various tricky scenarios - crosswind landings, mechanical failure, or turbulence and the like.\nBut on Sunday he will find himself attempting to keep a calm head in the Champions Trophy final against India in Dubai.\nIndia will be favourites but New Zealand, who beat India to win the 2000 edition, have progressed to their third Champions Trophy final via steady batting, dependable bowling and near-perfect fielding, led by the extraordinary Phillips.\nTwo 'Superman' catches in the group stage - one diving to his left to take Mohammad Rizwan one-handed and the other a mirror image leaping to his right to catch Virat Kohli - have reinforced the view that Phillips is the best fielder in the world.\n\"I did a fair bit of gymnastics at school growing up, so learning to tuck and roll, dive properly, land properly,\" he says.\n\"That probably gave me a lot more confidence than potentially your average person when hitting a hard surface on the ground.\n\"In the garden we had a big 16-foot trampoline and we always played like football goalkeeping stuff on it and we'd play like little cricket games on it.\n\"That probably had a huge impact on learning how to dive and being in a safe environment where you weren't going to get injured.\"\nCatching statistics can be misleading in cricket. \nA high catch percentage figure can look good but also mean the fielder has not attempted the more difficult chances. \nConversely, an athletic fielder could attempt difficult chances and be punished for only getting a fingertip to a ball others would not have reached.\nPhillips has managed to succeed regardless. \nHe has had more touches in the field than any other player (156) during this tournament and has a 100% catch success rate, despite fielding in the most difficult positions. \nHe would also reject one of cricket's oldest cliches - that fielding is something to be endured.\n\"I've always loved fielding since the beginning of playing,\" says Phillips, whose side also have the best catch percentage (91.2%) in the tournament.\n\"The reactionary catches like the dives, there's a big element of luck involved.\n\"I don't train those at all purely because if you train them and you get injured at training doing so then what's the point? There's no heroes at training.\n\"I've taken a few so you build up a bit of belief that if it's in that area, you have a chance. \n\"I've dropped plenty of them as well but, ultimately, if you push yourself to the limit, you're going to find where it is.\"\nIndia beat New Zealand in the group stage of the Champions Trophy but one of the highlights of the match was Phillips' catch to dismiss Virat Kohli\nWhen you sit with Phillips his attributes are obvious. \nBulging forearms, broad shoulders, huge thighs and a stocky frame all help him cover ground at speed, throw and leap from a low centre of gravity. He has also spoken about embracing being diagnosed with ADHD. \nBut Phillips, who was born in South Africa before moving to New Zealand with his family aged five, is not happy to settle with what he has been given physically. \nThe 28-year-old is a studier of the mechanics of fielding. He watches the NFL and, in particular, baseball for theories of how he can push those limits.\nHe practises throwing with his non-dominant left arm and tests different ways to collect the ball in the field, like picking up with his left hand and throwing with his right and vice versa to maintain momentum through the ball.\n\"In baseball, it's significantly quicker to pick it up on the move on your mitt side, carry on through the ball and then throw,\" Phillips says. \n\"Obviously that provides a lot of momentum and power.

I've used it in a game a couple of times and it's felt really cool.\"\nThose that know Phillips describe him as one of those people that is good at everything. \nElectric in the field, he is also a hard-hitting batter, bowls canny off-spin and has even been wicketkeeper at international level, something he has now stopped because \"there was no ability to move, no running, no diving and no ability to do something special unless the ball comes your way in your one specific spot\".\nPhillips has also taken up archery, which he believes helps his cricket.\n\"The element that I've taken out of that is being more process driven,\" he says.\n\"Obviously, baseball, I've seen the fielding element of it. Golf, the real patience side of things. \n\"But then archery is a real process-driven sport where if you focus on trying to hit the target, it often doesn't really work. \n\"If you focus on doing the things that you can do well, that being the process, the end result takes care of itself.\"\nPhillips believes New Zealand's fielding gives them \"an edge in big tournaments\" - they have reached a fourth men's white-ball final since 2015 here - but is also able to see the big picture when showing off his art.\n\"If it's a little thing I can do to give back to the cricket community and inspire the next generation to enjoy fielding rather than wanting to just sit on the sidelines and just bat and bowl, I think that's something that I'd be really happy to come out of this game with one day,\" Phillips says.\nPhillips hopes to be flying the skies after retirement. Perhaps others will follow his lead on the field.",

Two washouts in Rawalpindi made this more difficult.\nIt was between Joe Root and Shreyas Iyer at number four.

Matt Henry has been a standout as a seamer, here supported by Azmatullah Omarzai and Hardik Pandya, who are more than capable to bowl 10 overs each.\nKohli is a must as a master of the chase, while Duckett accumulated top-order runs in a side that otherwise struggled.

        "article_text": "Football fans - including Manchester United supporters at Old Trafford last weekend - have protested against rising ticket prices this season\nFootball fans can be tribal. But when it comes to ticket prices, there is unity.\n\"We are all fighting the same fight on ticket prices,\" said Manchester United Supporters' Trust CEO Duncan Drasdo.\n\"Clubs are exploiting loyalty and fans are united in saying enough is enough.\"\nWhen 19 of the Premier League's 20 clubs raised their ticket prices before the 2024-25 season, the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) launched a campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty'.\nThose protests have grown again this season, with some clubs removing concessionary discounts for the elderly and young people - and teams like Arsenal announcing increases for 2025-26.\nThe cost of competing for trophies, increasing operational expenses, and the threat of complying with financial regulations, have all been given as reasons for price hikes.\nBBC Sport has analysed a new Uefa report showing the league's financial power and how much clubs make from tickets - but also the challenge of increased staffing levels and expensive running costs.\nThis video can not be played\nArsenal fan Laura Kirk-Francis outlines her disappointment over ticket price hikes\nPremier League clubs made a total of almost 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) from selling tickets to home matches in 2023, Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report shows.\nThat figure is growing by about 10% per year, and is almost double that of Spain's  La Liga (\u00a3481m) and Germany's Bundesliga (\u00a3430m).\nThe report uses a mixture of full financial reporting of more than 700 clubs for 2023, plus 2024 figures from 130 of Europe's biggest clubs.\nOf the 10 clubs who generated the most income from gate receipts in 2024, six are English.\nThe same six Premier League clubs feature in the top 12 for another ticketing metric, which measures the money earned per fan, per ticket.\n\"What the figures show is that English top-flight clubs are doing very well financially in a whole number of different metrics,\" says Tom Greatrex, chair of the FSA.\n\"Healthy ticket revenue shows people are wanting to go - but also shows the ratcheting up of ticket prices in the past few years. That is manifesting itself in the protests and disenchantment we've seen.\"\nThe report also points out that \"stadium expansions and/or increases in premium seating and hospitality have also doubled gate revenues at Paris St-Germain, Bayern [Munich], Liverpool and Manchester City since 2009\".\nArsenal and Tottenham's positions are helped by sales of high-value hospitality seats at modern stadiums in London - one of the world's most-visited cities.\n\"What we have seen clubs do through stadium expansion is a huge focus on those seats being hospitality,\" says Dan Plumley, senior lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University. \n\"On a basic financial level it makes sense, because you can generate more from that than a baseline seat. \n\"But if that is stopping your more average fan getting a ticket, that is something clubs are going to have to grapple with.\"\nThe report states the average amount made per fan from tickets is \u00a329-\u00a337 \"for the majority of clubs\".\nFans from four rival clubs to protest at ticket prices\nMan Utd fans criticise ticket prices - as club reveals manager change costs\nPremier League ticket price rises - what the fans think\nThis video can not be played\nOne Manchester United fan explains why protests are planned\nThe Uefa report paints a similar picture to other research such as the annual Deloitte Money League - with Premier League clubs bringing in far more revenue  (\u00a36.2bn in 2023) than other European leagues.\nHowever, English clubs reported a combined loss of \u00a3728m before tax.\nTV rights deals are showing signs of plateauing, so clubs need to maximise matchday income and commercial and sponsorship revenues to try to offset significant spending on transfers, wages and running costs in order to turn a profit.\nThe report outlines some eye-watering spending figures:\nPremier League clubs spent \u00a34bn on player wages in 2023, almost double second-placed Spain (\u00a32.1bn).\nFour European clubs have squads that cost more than 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) to assemble by the end of 2024, and all are English - Chelsea (1.7bn euros/\u00a31.4bn), Manchester City (1.3bn euros/\u00a31.1bn), Manchester United (1.1bn euros/\u00a3920m), and Arsenal (1bn euros/\u00a3840m).\nChelsea's 2024 squad was found to be \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record - the 2020 Real Madrid squad. The report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nFour of the five most profitable clubs - by pre-tax profits - in 2024 were German: Bayern (\u00a353m), Borussia Dortmund (\u00a341m), Lazio (\u00a334m), Leipzig (\u00a331m), Eintracht Frankfurt (\u00a327m).\nThree of the five least profitable clubs in 2024 - by pre-tax losses - were English: Juventus (\u00a3164m), Chelsea (\u00a393m), Aston Villa (\u00a384m), Roma (\u00a363m), Liverpool (\u00a355m).\nPlumley says: \"Each individual club will have its own reasons for doing it, but raising ticket prices doesn't shift the dial massively in terms of the overall picture of the finances.\n\"I get that costs have gone up, we understand that side of the equation, but this is where it really grinds with fans.\"\nFans of some clubs have been contesting the loss of concessionary tickets for the elderly, juniors, and disabled supporters\nManchester United's controversial plans to make up to 450 redundancies,, external cut about 39% of its workforce and \"return the club to profitability\" have put a sharper focus on how many people are actually needed to run a football club - and the operating costs involved.\nWhile transfer spending remains a club's biggest outgoing, the report says high inflation in areas such as utilities, plus the wages spent on more employees to expand commercial activity, is biting. \nOperating costs have risen by 12% across Europe, with a total of \u00a31.5bn spent in the Premier League in 2023, almost \u00a3500m higher than second-placed Germany\nOperating costs plus non-player wages absorb just under half the revenue of big-five European league clubs\nIn 2024, six Premier League teams featured in the top 10 for money spent on operating costs.\n\"Operations costs have increased - that's fair,\" Greatrex says. \"But increasing ticket prices way beyond the level of inflation, year after year, which is what has started to happen with most clubs in the Premier League - and then trying to claim that PSR or financial fair play are the reason - is the clubs treating people as though they're idiots.\"\nSalaries paid to non-footballer staff members have also risen sharply.\nThe average top 20 club in Europe has 970 full-time employees - Barcelona have the most with 1,781\nFour Premier League teams have more than 1,000 full-time employees - Man Utd, Brighton, Liverpool and Man City\nPremier League clubs employed a total of 11,081 full-time employees by the end of 2023\nEnglish top-flight clubs paid a total of \u00a31bn in non-player wages in 2023. That total, which includes wages paid to staff members such as coaches, media departments and ticket office personnel, is more than twice that of second-placed Germany\nThere was 19% inflation on non-player wages across Europe in 2023 and for the biggest clubs, head coach wages rose on average 21% in 2024\nThat compares to a more modest average growth of 4.5% in player wages in 2024, which the report said was \"essential for financial stability as clubs struggle with strong inflation\".\nThe logic behind the rise in staffing numbers varies per club. Brighton, for example, employ a notoriously vast recruitment and scouting operation.\nThe report states that employee growth can be explained by clubs' desire to wring more from commercial and sponsorship deals.\nAcross Europe, income from commercial and sponsorship deals has risen by 39% since 2019.\n\"Commercial income is almost untapped in terms of potential and there is no restriction on the number of deals you can sign,\" Plumley says. \n\"But you have to throw more resource at that.\n\"There are more roles now in football clubs than ever before. Some of them are quite forward thinking.\n\"It's a natural consequence of how the game has evolved, because everyone is pushing for growth, growth, growth.\"",

He said he was considering new tariffs because \"Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now\".\nBut within hours, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin was acting as anyone else would.\n\"I think he's hitting them [Ukraine] harder than he's been hitting them,\" Trump said. \"And I think probably anyone in that position would be doing that right now.\" \nHe added that he believes Putin wants to end the war but he cannot say the same of Ukraine. \n\"I want to know they [Ukraine] want to settle and I don't know they want to settle,\" Trump said, when asked why he had cut off aid to Kyiv.\nTrump's direct diplomacy with Putin stunned Nato allies, because the West has shunned contacts with Moscow since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nDespite Trump's row with Zelensky, the tone from his foreign policy team in the last two days has sounded more conciliatory towards Ukraine, after its arm-wrenching in the form of cutting off military and intelligence support. \nThe Americans want Zelensky to sign a deal that would give them a major stake in Ukrainian minerals, and for him to agree to a quick truce with Moscow.\nZelensky has been pushing for firm security guarantees for Kyiv, to be agreed as part of the deal. Speaking on Friday, Trump said such a security guarantee could be discussed later and would be the \"easy part\". \nMeanwhile, space technology company Maxar told BBC Verify on Friday that the US had temporarily suspended Ukrainian access to some high quality imagery from US satellites.\nSatellite imagery is an important tool during a war as it allows armies to gather intelligence on their rivals.\nMaxar, a US-based company, has contracts to provide satellite imagery to various governments and companies.\nOne of those is the Global Enhanced GEOINT Deliver (GEGD) program, which gives users access to high quality imagery collected by the US government.\n\"The US government has decided to temporarily suspend Ukrainian accounts in GEGD,\" Maxar told the BBC. \"Each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data.\"\nThe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the US Department of Defense, confirmed the suspension was \"in accordance with the administration's directive on support to Ukraine\".\nNext week, Trump's senior officials will travel to Saudi Arabia to meet Zelensky's team amid growing pressure for him to sign up to Trump's demands.\nUkraine's president has said he hopes the talks will be \"meaningful\". On Friday, he said his country was \"ready for peace as soon as possible\" and had proposed \"concrete steps\" to achieve it. \n\"Every day, new Russian strikes and reality itself prove that it is Russia that must be forced to peace,\" he added.\nZelensky has expressed regret in the days since his public clash with Trump and worked to mend relations with the US.\nOn Thursday, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said Trump had received a letter from Zelensky that included an \"apology\" and \"sense of gratitude\".\n\"Hopefully, we get things back on track with the Ukrainians, and everything resumes,\" Witkoff said.\nUK officials have said around 20 countries are interested in joining a \"coalition of the willing\" to help Ukraine, as European leaders forge ahead with plans for much bigger military expenditure.\nFighting on the ground in Ukraine continued on Friday, with five people killed by Russian troops in the Donetsk region, according to local authorities.\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton, BBC Verify",

He said he was considering new tariffs because \"Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now\".But within hours, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin was acting as anyone else would. \"I want to know they [Ukraine] want to settle and I don't know they want to settle,\" Trump said, when asked why he had cut off aid to Kyiv.Trump's direct diplomacy with Putin stunned Nato allies, because the West has shunned contacts with Moscow since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Despite Trump's row with Zelensky, the tone from his foreign policy team in the last two days has sounded more conciliatory towards Ukraine, after its arm-wrenching in the form of cutting off military and intelligence support. \"The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the US Department of Defense, confirmed the suspension was \"in accordance with the administration's directive on support to Ukraine\".Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky and TrumpNext week, Trump's senior officials will travel to Saudi Arabia to meet Zelensky's team amid growing pressure for him to sign up to Trump's demands.Ukraine's president has said he hopes the talks will be \"meaningful\". Speaking on Friday, Trump said such a security guarantee could be discussed later and would be the \"easy part\".",

You don't worry; you don't start your day by reading the news about what happened in Ukraine, where there were attacks,\" she says.\n\"You fall asleep peacefully and wake up peacefully because your children are next to you, and nothing else is needed.\"\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nScotland survive late Wales comeback to win\nFifty minutes gone at Murrayfield and it was freewheelin' time. Five Scottish tries in the bag, a 27-point lead on the board and Finn Russell directing his players around the pitch with the authority of the world's greatest traffic cop.\nEasy. Scotland were all width and class, pace and execution. They were a joy. Blair Kinghorn, Huw Jones, Darcy Graham, Tom Jordan - even big Duhan van der Merwe was coming off his wing and getting involved in the show.\nAn exhibition of what is best about this team. Devastating. \nThey made bits of Wales, who were vulnerable to the wide game and who were caught out when Scotland ran up their guts. \nTheir composure was so shot that they gave their hosts a free seven-points when Ben Thomas lost the plot in the lead-up to Scotland's fourth try. They had a man in the bin and all hope in a skip. \nBut, hold on. This feeling of certainty and Scotland sit as well together as a hornets' nest and a big stick. When you watch Scotland through the decades that precise feeling of comfort in a game is when you really should start to feel uncomfortable.\nFive-try Scotland survive spirited Wales comeback\nScotland must be more 'ruthless' after Wales fright\nScotland reaction, analysis & have your say\nSame last year in Cardiff when the visitors led by 27 points early in the second half and were hanging on at the end. And same on Saturday. It wasn't quite the smelling salts and stretchers of 2024, but it was close.\nNobody can be sure, but with Wales scoring 21 unanswered points from the 62nd minute (plus a try for Taulupe Faletau that was disallowed) many people would have bet the house on Wales winning had it gone on much longer.\nIn boxing parlance, Scotland were stuck on the ropes, almost defenceless, eyes rolling in the back of their head as Wales unloaded. The last bell saved them from possible mortification.\nIn the first half they'd built their lead which saw them home and fair play to them for that. They won, they got five points and now they'll move on to Paris to try to stop what seems like the inevitable - a French title.\nThey'll travel, of course, with all the good wishes of their friends across the water. Irish fans are suddenly Scotland fans. \nGenerous souls that they are they'll wish Gregor Townsend and his players nothing but the best in Paris. A bit late to don the tartan, perhaps, but anyway.\nThis video can not be played\n'Superb' Russell stakes Lions claim\nSaturday was Scotland in microcosm, their excellence and their weakness. It was a day that showed again why you can't see them progressing to the status of contenders even if you buried your face in a vat of happy juice.\nEverything really started to go wrong when Russell was taken off as an injury precaution and the bench started to appear. Not enough of them make a positive impact. Several of them added to the errors and the chaos.\nScotland's hair caught fire when Teddy Williams drove over with 11 minutes left. Too easy, that. The home team had stopped working as hard it had been.\nFaletau's try didn't stand but it left an impact. In the preamble, Blair Morgan was missed by Stafford McDowall and Kyle Rowe, then after the illegal hurdling, he did George Horne. The score was correctly ruled out, but Wales were on a roll.\nThat last try showed Scotland in their panicked state. Joe Roberts eluded Kinghorn, then slipped out of trouble when Rowe, Jordan and Matt Fagerson came to him. It was like he was slathered in butter.\nA penalty, a lineout, a try for Max Llewellyn. Murrayfield silent, apart from the faint sound of sobbing. \nThe cameras turned to Russell who shook his head and looked like saying something beginning with F before the director cut away.\nScotland went to sleep, he said later. They switched off. The message all week, he stated, was to play for 80 minutes, but they didn't. Again. \nFair play to Russell, not just for the elegance of his performance but for the honesty of his assessment.\nThis video can not be played\n'Struggling to process last 20 minutes'\nThis team has a well-developed and debilitating trend of falling asleep in games. They didn't score in the last 33 minutes on Saturday. \nA fortnight ago they went an hour without scoring against England, against Ireland they didn't score for 41 minutes and then 26 minutes. Against Italy, they went 33 minutes without a point.\nThis is repeat behaviour from Scotland. Last season threw up similar numbers and so did the season before.  \nIt didn't cost them this time, but it remains a puzzler as to why this keeps happening. Are they always going to have the propensity for napping during games? \nIt's why we can admire many of the things this team does, but it's very hard to trust them. We can marvel at their creativity, but elan alone is not cutting it at the sharp end of the championship.\nAnd so to Paris against the mighty French. Scotland at their very, very best are unpredictable enough, and mad enough, to make it a scary day for Fabien Galthie.\nScotland are not a conventional team. They have players that could hurt France. They have a mindset that could cut them open and give them much to think about. \nThey don't have a hang-up about the French the way they do against the Irish. Psychology won't be a problem.\nFrance will surely win - and maybe very comfortably - because on top of the flair in the backline they have monsters up front. Many, many monsters. \nThey have eight starters and possibly another seven on the bench. To hell, Fabien, go 8-0 and be done with it. Bring out every brute, from Perpignan to Picardy.\nFrance won a seismic victory in Dublin and will feel invincible now. Scotland won a shaky one in Edinburgh and Lord only knows how they'll be feeling. \nThey won, though. That's kinda the point. But does it always have to be so dramatic?\nPodcast: 'Scotland took foot off gas and switched off'\n08/03/25",

While there remain outside chances of salvaging a title from the wreckage, the emotional swing is surely huge. \nIreland have not lost consecutive games since 2021 and Doris was quick to try and turn the page to Italy in Rome next week.\nHe said: \"Regardless of how the table is shaping up we still want to get our best performance out there and finish on a high for the [retiring] lads and as a team on a whole.\"\nYet, for a team that has made no bones about the desire for a signature achievement, when including the failure to make it beyond the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 2023, there is an undeniable feeling that three have now slipped from their grasp in the space of just 17 months.

        "article_text": "After being sealed off from the outside world for decades and experiencing a mass exodus, Albania is leaning into its culinary roots with the help of grandma chefs.\nTefta Pajenga, aged 76, is one of many pension-age TV chefs in Albania. In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrak\u00eb, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\nJaprak\u00eb holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens \u2013 20% of the population \u2013\u00a0fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine \u2013 except for women of a certain age.\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ci\u011feri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlija\u0161 (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\nSome indigenous foods, like mishavin\u00eb\u00a0(a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tav\u00eb krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\n\u00a0Xhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\nXhahysa's recipe of f\u00ebrges\u00eb (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjiz\u00eb (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania\u2019s forgotten past.\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Peak of the Balkans Trail: Europe's last true wilderness\n\u2022 A new 5,500km bike trail connecting one of Europe's most remote regions\n\u2022 Kuk\u00ebs: The first city ever nominated for a Nobel Prize\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods \u2013 many sourced from grandmothers \u2013 is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what Ren\u00e9 [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In announcing the decision to postpone some tariffs on Mexico for another month, US President Donald Trump was at pains to praise his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\"I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum\", he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. \"Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border.\"\nThe comments were in stark contrast to the kind of language he has used for the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, who he continues to refer to as \"Governor Trudeau\", while calling Canada \"the 51st State\". \nThe war of words \u2013 if not yet trade \u2013 continues between Canada and the Trump administration with Prime Minister Trudeau calling the entire tariffs policy \"dumb\" and the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, calling him a \"numbskull\" in return.\nThe difference in tone between the US neighbour to the north and the one to the south could hardly be more striking.\nSome, particularly in Claudia Sheinbaum's camp, see it as evidence of her deft handling of an unpredictable leader in the White House, one who has made several bold statements of intent, only for them to be rolled back or watered down.\nCertainly, President Sheinbaum has delivered a singular message from the start: Mexicans should \"remain calm\" over Trump, she has said, insisting that \"cooler heads will prevail.\"\nIn that sense, it has been so far, so good for the Mexican leader.\nTwice, now, in two months she has managed to stave off the imposition of sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexican goods through a last-minute phone call to President Trump \u2013 even though he said there was \"no room\" for negotiation. \nIt is testament to her diplomacy that Trump seems to genuinely appreciate her tone, clarity and overall demeanour in their interactions.\nShe has refused to accept publicly that Mexico hasn't done enough on either of the main border issues on which Trump is demanding action from his neighbours: fentanyl trafficking and undocumented immigration north.\nShe began Thursday's morning press briefing by referring to new figures from the US Customs and Border Protection agency which show seizures of fentanyl have dropped to 263 kilos, their lowest levels in 3 years. It represents a 75% drop in the last six months of her presidency.\nWhen tariffs were avoided in February, Sheinbaum agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border. \nHer administration has also extradited (although they prefer the word \"expelled\") 29 drug cartel figures to the US to face trial on charges from murder to money laundering, including a top drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been wanted by the US authorities since the mid-1980s.\nThose may well have been the measures Trump was referring to when he said the two countries were \"working hard, together\" on border security.\nFurthermore, she has often thrown the ball back in the US president's direction. \nWhere do the guns which arm the cartels come from, she asks rhetorically, openly calling for the US to do more to curb the flow of weapons south and tackle its demand for illegal drugs. The drugs may come from Latin America, she points out, but the market for their consumption is overwhelmingly in the US.\nEven when the Trump administration recently designated six Mexican cartels as \"foreign terrorist organisations\", it seemed to strengthen her hand.\nThat's because her administration is currently embroiled in a legal battle with US gun manufacturers over negligence. If US weapons-makers have allowed their products to reach terrorists rather than mere criminals, Mexico could expand its lawsuit, she said, to include a new charge of \"complicity\" with terror groups.\nAnd yet while President Sheinbaum is enjoying a strong start to her presidency \u2013 both domestically and in the eyes of the world \u2013 for her handling of Trump, it is worth stressing that these are early days in their bilateral relationship.\n\"I think she has played the hand she has been dealt pretty well\", said Mexican economist, Valeria Moy. \"I'm not sure it's time for celebration just yet. But I think she has done what she can in the face of the threat of tariffs. It makes little sense for either of side to enter into a trade war.\"\nThe key to Sheinbaum's success seems to have been in refusing to back down on unreasonable requests or matters of real importance, while similarly not appearing subservient or acquiescent to the White House's demands. \nThat is not an easy path to tread.\nOn some questions \u2013 the Gulf of Mexico being renamed by Trump as the Gulf of America, for example \u2013 she can afford to remain above the fray knowing that most people around the world are unlikely to adopt his preferred terminology. \nOn others, particularly tariffs, the stakes are considerably higher; there's a danger that the constant back-and-forth and instability on the issue could push the Mexican economy into recession.\nThe Mexican peso weakened again during this latest episode and, although Sheinbaum claims the country's economy is strong, the markets would clearly prefer a more reliable and solid relationship with the US. Mexico remains the US's biggest trading partner, after all.\nWhen I spoke to President Sheinbaum on the campaign trail last year, shortly before she made history by becoming Mexico's first woman president, she said she would have no problem working with a second Trump presidency and that she would always \"defend\" what was right for Mexicans \u2013 including the millions who reside in the US.\n\"We must always defend our country and our sovereignty,\" she told me.\nWith so much bluster between these three neighbours in recent days, it is easy to forget that the Trump presidency is still only six weeks old.\nThe new relationship with the White House has a long way to go, with the USMCA trade agreement to be renegotiated next year. But certainly, amid all the political theatre, Claudia Sheinbaum will be more pleased than Justin Trudeau with how it has started.",

The monthly gain in February was similar to the average monthly rise of 168,000 over the past year, the Labor Department said. \nHiring was driven by healthcare and financial firms. The manufacturing sector also added about 10,000 jobs, gains that were highlighted by the Trump administration. \nGovernment hiring slowed sharply, while analysts cautioned that the report did not yet reflect the full extent of the cuts that the White House has announced.\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the report felt \"reassuringly in line with expectations, showing payrolls growth only modestly weaker than in recent months\". \n\"Yet, while the worst fears were not met, the report does confirm that the labour market is cooling,\" she warned.\n\"Furthermore, with no shortage of headwinds confronting the US economy, the softening trend is likely to persist and may potentially deepen given the toxic combination of federal government layoffs, public spending cuts, and tariff uncertainty related inertia.\"\nEven before Donald Trump took office as president, financial analysts had been surprised at the long-running streak of growth in the US labour market, which came despite pressure from price increases and high interest rates.\nIn his first weeks, Trump's changes to US policy have added to pressures on the economy, generating widespread uncertainty.  \nHis changes include tariffs on America's top three trade partners, some of which have since been reversed, and cuts to federal jobs and spending, efforts that are facing challenges in the courts. \nIn remarks at the White House, Trump acknowledged that \"there could be some disturbance\" in the economy. But he said he thought reducing the size of government and moving forward with tariffs would unleash private sector growth.\n\"I think the labour market's going to be fantastic but it's going to have high-paying manufacturing jobs as opposed to government jobs,\" he said, adding that he could not commit to policy certainty on trade.\n\"There will always be changes,\" he said.  \nPolls indicate that the moves have the support of his base. But financial analysts have warned that they are contributing to worries in financial markets, hurting consumer sentiment and fuelling weakness across a range of other economic indicators. \nThe latest jobs report showed average hourly pay up 4% compared with a year ago, but the number of people reporting they were working part-time because of slack business conditions jumped.  \nSeparately, a measure of manufacturing showed new orders dropping sharply last month. Retail sales posted their biggest drop in two years in January, while foot traffic at major chains such as Target, Walmart and McDonald's fell last month, according to data from tracking firm Placer.ai.\nPrivate firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that layoff announcements in February jumped to their highest level since July 2020, driven by government cuts.\nBut the number of companies warning of job cuts coming in the next few months also jumped, while starting to spread to new sectors, noted Andy Challenger, vice president of the firm. \nThe Labor Department report \"falls squarely in line with big slow cooling of the labour market that we've seen for two years - that story of that nice soft landing,\" he said.\n\"My expectation will be that as these get revised in the coming months, we'll start to see this look worse than it does at first blush.\"\nShares in the US were trading lower at around midday, with the S&P 500 down more than 1%.",

        "article_text": "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.\nAll the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.\nThe test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.\nSuch metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.\n\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.\nThe firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.\nThe robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.\nSuch a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.\n\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.\nDeep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"\nScars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.\nIn 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.\nOpposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.\nNautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.\nMinerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.\nCurrently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.\nNo commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.\nMr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.\nHe adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.\nUnlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.\nHe also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"\nJovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.\nSome deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.\n\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"\nThe Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.\nMr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".\nThose calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.\n\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.\nThe Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.\nDutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.\nThe Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.\nClaims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.\nJeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.\nSome sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.\nMr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.\nAnn Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.\nDr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.\nAnd there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.\n\"When you delve deeper into it, and you look at which minerals actually have supply shortages, I'm not sure that adds up,\" she says.",

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen is aiming to become only the second driver to win five successive drivers' championships in 2025\nRed Bull might have won the world drivers' title for the fourth year in a row with Max Verstappen last year, but they head into the new season under conspicuous pressure.\nThey have lost their design guru, following Adrian Newey's move to Aston Martin, rivals are circling around Verstappen, and over the second half of last year, Red Bull had only the third fastest car in Formula 1.\nSo what is at stake for Red Bull as they head into the final year of F1's current regulations?\nVerstappen's fourth title was founded on the points advantage he built in a brief period of dominance at the start of the year, and an outstanding performance from the Dutchman for the remainder of the season.\nFrom the sixth race of the season in Miami, the car no longer retained the massive advantage over the rest of the field it had enjoyed in the first five races, or the two preceding years.\nYes, it ended the year as on average the fastest car in qualifying - by 0.052 seconds over the McLaren. But take the numbers from Miami onwards and the McLaren was faster by 0.053secs. Over the second half the season, the McLaren was faster by 0.142secs and Red Bull were also slower than Ferrari - by 0.008secs.\nHad McLaren started the season in a stronger position, therefore, Verstappen's championship would have been a lot harder to win.\nRed Bull's issue was that a fundamental balance disconnect became more apparent as they tried to add performance to their car. They struggled to solve their mid-corner, slow-speed understeer without creating oversteer in the fast corners.\nNewey said: \"Already through the very last stages of '23, the car was starting to become more difficult to drive,\" Newey said. \"Max could handle it. Checo (Sergio Perez) couldn't.\n\"That carried into the first part of '24, but the car was still quick enough to be able to cope with it.\n\"It's something I was starting to become concerned about, but not many other people in the organisation seemed to be very concerned about it.\n\"And from what I can see from the outside, but I don't know\u2026 the guys at Red Bull, this is no criticism, but I think they just \u2013 perhaps through lack of experience \u2013 kept going in that same (development) direction. And the problem became more and more acute, to the point that even Max found it difficult to drive.\"\nRed Bull believe they lost ground because they did not exploit aero-elasticity of front wings as much as McLaren, Mercedes and later Ferrari.\nThis method of construction enables teams to build the carbon-fibre in their front-wing in such a way as to have the elements flex downwards at high speed, reducing downforce and therefore oversteer, but have them move back into optimum downforce mode at slower speeds.\nNew rules for this season limit the flexibility of wings - at the rear from the first race, and at the front from the Spanish Grand Prix in June.\nThe question is whether this was the sole issue Red Bull faced, and whether they can catch up the ground McLaren and Ferrari made last year, and whatever development progress their rivals have made over the winter.\nNewey's departure came in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment and coercive, controlling behaviour made against team principal Christian Horner by a female employee.\nHorner has always denied the allegations and was cleared by two separate Red Bull internal investigations. But they unsettled Newey, and added to the disquiet Red Bull's design chief was already feeling about internal politics within the engineering team.\nThere was a disagreement as to who was primarily responsible for Red Bull's recent success. Newey felt technical director Pierre Wache was unfairly pushing for credit - and Horner backed him publicly. Whereas Newey saw the 2022 car and fundamental concept Red Bull followed for F1's current regulations as very much his.\nThe 2025 car will inevitably be an evolution of the 2024 design, given that this is the final year of a set of technical regulations and there is massive change coming for next year. Nevertheless, Newey's departure gives Wache and the rest of the design team a chance to prove themselves out of Newey's shadow.\nIt is a chance for Red Bull to prove a point, but it could go either way.\nRed Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has already been quoted saying that he believed the team were slower to get on top of their problems in 2024 than they would have been had Newey still been involved.\nIf they cannot return to having the best car, then there will be a major spotlight on Red Bull and serious questions being asked.\nMax and Jos Verstappen with Red Bull team boss Christian Horner during pre-season testing in Bahrain last month\nThe pressure on Red Bull is all the greater because of the potential ramifications of this year on Verstappen's future.\nThe Dutchman, 27, is under contract to Red Bull until the end of 2028, but his deal has performance clauses in it - the details of which are not known publicly. That means that if Red Bull don't produce a competitive, winning car, Verstappen could leave.\nVerstappen's father Jos made it abundantly clear in 2024 that he was not happy about Horner remaining in charge, saying back at the first race of the season that the team risked breaking apart if Horner stayed on as boss.\nAs Newey's departure was followed by that of sporting director Jonathan Wheatley to Sauber/Audi, and head of strategy Will Courtenay's decision to leave for McLaren - although Courtenay is currently being held to his contract - it could be argued that Jos Verstappen has a point.\nRelations between Horner and Verstappen Sr remain tense, even if an uneasy truce has developed in recent months.\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff has made no secret of the fact that he wants Verstappen in one of his cars as soon as he can get him.\nVerstappen could also have future options at Aston Martin, where Fernando Alonso's contract expires at the end of 2026, and Ferrari, where both Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc are said to reach potential break points in their deals at the same time.\nThe forthcoming 2026 regulations complicate things - the Verstappens may wish to wait and see how things pan out next year, given that both the chassis and engine rules are changing then.\nBut if Red Bull are not competitive this year, the temptation to jump early may be significant.\nHorner remains in situ, with the backing of Red Bull's main shareholder Chalerm Yoovidhya. The Austrian side of the team is said to be less supportive.\nThe allegations brought an internal power struggle at Red Bull out into the open, between the Thai and Austrian shareholders, and between Horner and Marko.\nMuch as with Horner and Jos Verstappen, there is currently a truce. Will it hold?\nAnd it remains to be seen whether the complainant will take matters further legally.\nAfter two seasons of Sergio Perez struggling alongside Verstappen, Red Bull finally lost patience with the Mexican at the end of last year and paid him off.\nThat decision was very expensive - it was made despite Horner deciding in the early summer last year to grant Perez a two-year contract extension to the end of 2026, when they could have signed Carlos Sainz instead.\nIn Perez's place, Red Bull have promoted New Zealander Liam Lawson.\nHorner acknowledges that being Verstappen's team-mate is probably the toughest job in F1, and Red Bull are asking Lawson to come in and do better than Perez after a career that has so far spanned only 11 grands prix for Red Bull's second team over two seasons.\nLiam Lawson drove five F1 races for Red Bull's second team in 2023 and six in 2024\nLawson put in some creditable and combative performances on his return last year, following Red Bull's decision to drop Daniel Ricciardo from their Racing Bulls team. But on average he was slightly slower than team-mate Yuki Tsunoda in qualifying.\nThere is no doubt that Perez's failings last year cost the team dearly in the constructors' championship.\nHe finished last out of all the drivers from the top four teams, and failed to score a podium finish after the fifth race of the season in China. That was a major factor in Red Bull slumping to third in the teams' title chase behind McLaren and Ferrari.\nBut Perez's average qualifying deficit to Verstappen was just over 0.4secs, which is better than Alex Albon managed in 2020 and Pierre Gasly in 2019 before each was dropped. And Albon and Gasly have gone on to produce impressive performances for their new teams, Williams and Alpine.\nLawson will be under pressure to prove he is a step up from Perez, or the decision-making process of Red Bull management will come back under scrutiny.\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nNetflix series shows moment Horner learns of alleged messages\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "article_text": "Men's Six Nations: Ireland v France\nVenue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday, 8 March Kick-off: 14:15 GMT\nCoverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1\nPeruse Ireland and France's line-ups for Saturday's potential Six Nations title decider and you'll find no shortage of instantly compelling head-to-head battles. \nCaelan Doris v Gregory Alldritt pits two of the world's best number eights against one another, Andrew Porter v Uini Atonio will be an engrossing scrum-time tussle, while powerhouse Irish centre Bundee Aki will meet his match in Yoram Moefana. \nBut naturally, most eyes are drawn to the battle of the scrum-halves. \nIn Antoine Dupont, France have a generational talent. A world player of the year in both the 15s and sevens codes, an Olympic gold medallist and a poster boy for his sport, Dupont has gleefully exhausted superlatives in recent years. \nHis otherworldly gifts even moved his Toulouse team-mates to refer to him as 'the Martian', Emmanuel Meafou revealed last year.\nDupont's worthy adversary on Saturday is Jamison Gibson-Park. 'Jamo' to his team-mates, he is Ireland's unflappable metronome and the frontrunner to wear nine for the British and Irish Lions in Australia this summer.\n\"Yeah, it will be interesting,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"Two fabulous players at the peak of their game. There are a number of individual battles across the teams, but that one will be pretty special.\"\nThis will not be the first time Gibson-Park and Dupont have crossed paths, of course. They have twice met in the Champions Cup, including last year's final when Dupont's Toulouse beat Gibson-Park's Leinster in extra time.  \nThey have met three times in the Six Nations, although not since 2022 (Gibson-Park was injured in 2023 while Dupont skipped last year's championship). \nThis time, the stakes are suitably sky-high.\nSix Nations: Ireland v France preview, coverage & stats\nDupont plays down Henry visit before Ireland game\nWinning 50th cap 'an incredible honour' - Bealham\nThis video can not be played\nIs Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?\nThis is a hugely important game for 28-year-old Dupont and France. For a player regarded by some as the greatest of all time, a single Six Nations title - in 2022 - is an underwhelming return. \nHe does not lack emotional ammunition heading to Dublin. In 2023, not even his herculean try-saving tackle on Mack Hansen could stop Ireland's charge to the Grand Slam. \nLater that year, France's home World Cup campaign ended in the quarter-finals. With his Olympic debut on the horizon, Dupont sat out last year's Six Nations as Les Bleus again finished second to the Irish. He led Toulouse to the Champions Cup in May, but craves more silverware at Test level.\nConsidering his Top 14 commitments are likely to rule him out of facing the All Blacks in the summer, the next couple of weeks takes on even greater significance as he leads France's bid to shift the Six Nations balance of power back to Paris. \nReassuringly for France head coach Fabien Galthie, Dupont has shone since his sevens sojourn. \nIn his first game back for Toulouse, in October, he scored a 13-minute hat-trick against Clermont. On his Test return, he captained his country to an unbeaten autumn campaign, which included a 30-29 win over New Zealand. \nFresh from scoring four tries in as many Champions Cup pool games for Toulouse, he sparkled on his Six Nations return.\nDupont's assist for Theo Attissogbe's try launched a 43-0 rout over Wales, his dead-eyed cross-kick encapsulating the decision-making and accuracy that helps set him apart.\nHe did, however, endure a rare off-night in the defeat by England. He was well shackled by the home side's defence and was not immune to the handling errors that derailed the French cause, dropping a Thomas Ramos pass when an opening try seemed a certainty.\nBut as the greats often do, he bounced back, masterfully orchestrating a French attack that scored 11 tries against Italy in Rome. \nHe even bagged himself a couple, his first Six Nations tries since the Grand Slam-clinching win over England in 2022. \nFrance missed Dupont last year, but he has been at the centre of this year's title bid, his eight direct try involvements (two tries, six assists) bettered only by his team-mate Louis Bielle-Biarrey (four tries, five assists). \nSignificantly, Romain Ntamack returns from suspension to partner Toulouse team-mate Dupont at half-back in Dublin. They started all five games of France's 2022 Grand Slam triumph together, but only one since the 2023 World Cup because of Ntamack's injuries and Dupont's sevens commitments.\nWhile Dupont is a global superstar, Gibson-Park prefers to stay away from the spotlight. Unfortunately for him, he is too good to remain in the background.  \nIt hasn't always been this way.\nAfter giving up on representing New Zealand, Gibson-Park moved to Leinster from the Hurricanes in 2016. He qualified for Ireland under the residency rule in 2019 but was left out of Joe Schmidt's World Cup squad. \nHe had to bide his time at Leinster, too, behind Luke McGrath, who started the 2018 and 2019 Champions Cup finals.\nIreland coach Andy Farrell, however, recognised his potential, handing him his Test debut in October 2020. \nHe shone in the autumn wins over Japan and New Zealand a year later, broke up Ireland's iconic Johnny Sexton-Conor Murray partnership and has not looked back, rarely being overlooked when fit.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT\nHaving missed last summer's Test series in South Africa through injury, Gibson-Park has elevated his game. In November's defeat by New Zealand, he was one of a select few in green who showed up, and was key in the victories over Argentina and Australia.\nHe has been even better in the Six Nations, delivering a series of game-changing moments for Ireland in recent weeks. \nIn his player-of-the-match display against England, he scored a crucial try to jolt Ireland out of a sluggish start, brilliantly side-stepping Freddie Steward after James Lowe had shrugged off Alex Mitchell. \nHe was arguably even better as Ireland powered past Scotland in Murrayfield. \nHis superb, try-saving tackle on Blair Kinghorn - after sprinting more than half the length of the field - demonstrated his defensive awareness, speed and ability to read the play as he stopped the hosts cutting Ireland's lead to two points.\nIn Cardiff - where he again won player of the match - he showed how his kicking helps Ireland open teams up. With Ireland trailing Wales 18-13 in the second half, it was his pinpoint cross-kick that allowed Lowe to palm the ball into Jamie Osborne's path for a crucial try.\nAlongside Lowe and Sam Prendergast, Gibson-Park has been at the forefront of Ireland's ramped-up kicking game this year. He recently said he \"couldn't kick snow off a rope\" when he arrived at Leinster in 2016, so he has turned weakness into strength.\nDupont came out on top when he last faced Gibson-Park in the 2024 Investec Champions Cup final \nGibson-Park is softly spoken in front of the media but his leadership should not be overlooked, either. \nAfter Sexton's retirement, he has helped guide untested fly-halves Jack Crowley and Prendergast through their debut Six Nations campaigns.  \nTo win in Dublin and take control of the championship, both sides need every facet operating with optimum efficiency. \nBut much will hinge on how the nines fare. Considering what they have produced in recent weeks, they are poised to take centre stage on Saturday. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'No one wanted to give me a chance' - Gonzalez Quintero\nOn the streets they call him 'Kego'. The one-time wonderkid left to train alone in a concrete wilderness of city towerblock staircases. A cage footballer for hire, a pick-up game artist on speed dial. The embers of his professional dream still flickering in a footballing underworld.\nKevin Gonzalez Quintero was once Jude Bellingham's England room-mate, played in the same youth teams as Jamal Musiala and Harvey Elliott and was the guy a young Jhon Duran would ask for boots.\n\"Jude, he is a great lad,\" remembers Kego. \"He is very chill, a great person on and off the pitch. You can see why he is where he is today. Since that very young age he has had that leadership. Very mature.\"\nHis father once played for Deportivo Cali, but Kego's parents packed up and left a Colombia that he says was in the grip of Pablo Escobar and the nation's drug cartels to swap South America for a new life in south London before he was born.\nThat allowed Kego to shine in front of Crystal Palace scouts, joining the Eagles aged eight and later winning their academy player of the year.\nAfter a decade with Palace he believed he was destined for the Premier League and life on the international stage. As well as England, Kego represented Colombia at youth level.\n\"It was a dream,\" he says. \"I always wanted to play for Colombia. Duran was there with me. He is a funny guy.\n\"He has always been good, but he wasn't banging in goals like that. Which shows his dedication, his time. It worked out for him. I'm very happy for him, too. He deserves it, I saw how hard it was for him.\n\"I remember him asking me for football boots. Just seeing him now is like 'wow, you have grown so much and I am proud of you, man'.\"\nThose players have gone on to represent some of the world's biggest clubs - Bellingham at Real Madrid, Musiala at Bayern Munich and Elliott at Liverpool, while former Aston Villa striker Duran is making his fortune in Saudi Arabia.\nBut for Kego, it didn't work out like that. \nHe was released by Palace at 18 and, via false dawns and broken promises, spent four years travelling the world, trialling in 14 different countries, yearning for a professional contract.\n\"I thought I was going to have the world at my feet,\" says the now 22-year-old. \"I played with Colombia, I played with England. I was at Palace for 10 years. I was pretty sure I'd get a club, easily, but then I got exposed to the real world, quickly.\"\nJamal Musiala and Kego on England youth team duty\nSo what went wrong for Kego at Crystal Palace? He was offered an extension, he says, but it did not materialise. \n\"I got different advice that I shouldn't have listened to,\" recalls Kego. \"Two months later, they just told me 'Look, Kevin, we're not going to guarantee you any game time for next year, you're better off looking for other teams. You're a very good player, we believe you can start your professional career elsewhere'.\n\"I was very down, 10 years here and then just like that, gone.\n\"A few agents, they lied to me. Saying 'listen, we have got this club for you and this club'. They sell you the world. But when it came to the time, nothing happened. That was really upsetting.\"\nHe was caught in a spiral of failed trials and wasted journeys - Hungary, Spain, even Brazil.\n\"Before you know it, you're six months without a club, then a year, then it carries on going,\" adds Kego. \"They start questioning your ability. Often I heard from clubs 'Oh, but he's been out for six months, oh, two years now'.\n\"Then when I did get the chance, I would be so mentally drained, to the point I couldn't focus. And when I was there, there would be another agent telling me 'listen, I've got you a first-team game'.\n\"I went to another team in Spain. The agent sorted the travel and everything, but when I got there, he blocked me. I didn't hear from him again and I was left stranded.\"\nAt the same time, his mum became seriously ill and needed the support of Kego and his father. \n\"Seeing your mum, the person that raised you, when she's ill, that kills you as a son,\" he says. \"She is still recovering, she has days that are good and days that are bad. We are getting there.\"\nKego with Xavi Simons, now of RB Leipzig and the Netherlands, after a youth match against Barcelona\nKego with the Colombia Under-17s squad\n1 of 2\nTo stay prepared for an opportunity, Kego would train relentlessly on his own.\n\"It almost felt like a prison cell,\" he explains. \"You wake up, you train, you see the same surroundings over and over again. Four years, the same thing.\n\"I would wake up, I would see bricks, blocks. It's mad. Going from seeing grass, everything is cut for you, you have got new balls - now I am maybe playing with a flat football, playing with a tennis ball or a golf ball.\n\"It's called the towerblock in my area. Every day I would be running up the stairs, training with my dad. I would even go to the park, on an 11-a-side pitch, I would start passing the ball to imaginary team-mates and then I would go and chase after the ball myself. It wasn't easy, but you have to work with what you have.\"\nBut it was not just a physical battle. He could eat well and run until the sun came up - and friends say they would get calls at 4am to do just that - but mentally, with no end in sight, the churn was taxing.\n\"When you're not at a team you're getting frustrated because you know your talent, you know that you can do that, that you're a good player, you have played with the best before,\" says Kego. \"Mentally it is killing you.\"\nKego says he went \"deep inside my mind\". He tried new things - he practises Simran meditation and, as a Christian, studies the Bible and prays. \nBut he also found salvation on the streets, with a ball at his feet.\n\"Street football is what gives you that tempo,\" he beams. \"Short spaces. You have got to think quick. It really helped me. It gave me a lot of confidence. I was like 'you know what, if I can do it in this short space, imagine a bigger space'.\"\nKego built a reputation in cage tournaments and pick-up games, becoming renowned in street football circles and even earning a deal with Puma.\n\"Everyone knew if they wanted to win with style, call him,\" laughs Gundeep Anand, the founder of street football tournament The Last Stand.\nIt was in one such tournament Kego was spotted by Spanish side UD Ibarra, and suddenly the dream was revived.\nKego earned a glowing reputation on the street football scene, playing in tournaments such as The Last Stand \nDiego Maradona Jr is the head coach of Spanish side UD Ibarra, who play on the island of Tenerife\nIbarra, from Tenerife, play in the fifth tier but are pushing for promotion and showing ambition. They recently appointed Diego Maradona Jr as head coach.\n\"He passed the ball to me and I said 'what, wait, [it's like] his dad is passing the ball to me',\" Kego remembers of their first meeting on the training pitch. \"It's a bit mad. I was watching his dad's YouTube videos and then his son is passing the ball to me.\n\"The way they walk, they have a similar look. It's very motivating.\"\nThe forward is waiting to make his debut and Maradona Jr is keen to see the youngster kickstart his career in the Canary Islands.\n\"We needed a player like him,\" he says. \"Quick. Good technically, and had some experience in professional teams like Crystal Palace, the Colombian national team.\n\"He can bring speed to the game.  A player who can score many goals and who understands the game.\n\"We hope he can bring a different mentality that we are trying to change with the team and the club.\"\nKego describes joining Ibarra as \"relief\". Now, he says, \"it's time to shine\".\n\"I was buzzing, excited, very emotional as well,\" he adds.\n\"All these years of work, I would never have thought I would make it pro at 22. If I'm honest, I said let me just dedicate myself to playing street football.\"\nThat is one dream accomplished, but what comes next?\n\"I always think big,\" he smiles. \"Short term is smash it here, do my best, focus and try and get many goals and get the club promotion.\n\"Longer term... I want to be the best player in the world one day.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

We are going to go out to dinner with our partners. We are going to do it.\"\nDiscussing their conversation pre-surgery, she said: \"The temptation, of course, was to say to him: 'I've got three children.

Chemotherapy or radiotherapy can also be used if the surgery is not successful.\nMother-of-three McCall said that although she was told to expect a good outcome, minor risks of death or losing her short-term memory from the operation meant that she decided to put her affairs in order before the procedure.\n\"I set up my whole life before I went into the operating theatre knowing that, if I didn't make it, the kids would be OK,\" she said.\n\"I needed to go under the anaesthetic knowing I had my ducks in a row.\n\"It was my way of letting go. And I am so grateful for that process, because I realised through all of it that, if I were not around, my children would be on the right path.\n\"If this hadn't happened to me, I'd have stayed in 'mum mode'. I love my kids so much, but I looked at them and thought: 'Would they be OK without me?' And the answer was yes, and that made me so proud.\n\"I've always been a grateful person but this brain operation has supersized my gratitude.\"\nMcCall spent time in intensive care before returning home, where she was cared for by family including her partner, celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas.\nA longtime advocate of women's health, McCall was given a special recognition award at the National Television Awards last year after having been awarded an MBE in 2023 for services to broadcasting.",

        "article_text": "The enigmatic musician has released one of the most raved-about LPs of recent times. But they've done it without marketing or interviews \u2013 and you certainly won't find it on Spotify.\nOf all the musical acts that emerged last year, none was more fascinating \u2013 or more mysterious \u2013 than Cindy Lee. Last March, their album Diamond Jubilee \u2013 an astonishing two-hour, 32-track, lo-fi heliograph of rock and pop's formative sounds \u2013 appeared as if by magic: a sprawling, sumptuous, dream-like immersion of melodiously beautiful, often haunting songs of loss and longing. But this self-released album wasn't easily accessible, exactly, being unavailable on streaming services, or in any physical format.\u00a0\nWarning: This article contains language that some may find offensive\u00a0\nThe music was beguilingly kaleidoscopic, moving from its aesthetic core of girl groups like The Supremes through folk, psych, glam, rockabilly, doo-wop, Velvet Underground-esque rock and Righteous Brothers-like balladry. But to hear it, you had to go to an antiquated 1990s-modelled GeoCities-style website and download the files from a service called Mega, with a suggested donation of $30; it was uploaded to YouTube shortly after.\nPeople were also eagerly scrambling to find out: who exactly is Cindy Lee anyway? There was no PR campaign, no interviews, and no social media presence. In fact, as it transpired, it was the enigmatic drag alter ego of alternative Canadian singer-songwriter Patrick Flegel, whose band Women had been a combustible but admired act in the 00s indie rock scene, releasing two acclaimed albums before splitting after an onstage fistfight.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nFlegel began their Cindy Lee project in 2012. It was shortly after their first live performance, playing bass in a friend's band, in their now trademark drag look: beehive wig, gold or silver sequined dresses, knee-high boots and fur coat. \"In the context of modern drag, the way I do drag is so tame, conventional, basic, and traditional,\" they said in a rare 2020 interview. \"I'm like, 60s closet queen drag... [in] a tradition of diva archetypes like Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Diana Ross.\" The music and the look weren't matched in any particularly deliberate way, Flegel also explained in another 2022 interview. \"They didn't really have anything to do with each other initially,\" he said, \"they just kind of blended together. But that's kind of a long game thing, where it's not just some idea that I wrote down on paper \u2013 it's just my life.\"\nFlegel's previous six albums as Cindy Lee had made little imprint: Diamond Jubilee's grand unorthodoxy could have been another hard sell. But switched-on music fans discovering the album couldn't get enough. As old-school word-of-mouth hype built, internet forums such as Reddit were awash with praise; the YouTube comment section was unanimously effusive (\"This is one of the best albums I've heard in a decade. Wow\" read a typical post). \"There was a certain air of mystery to it that made it feel unique,\" says Steven Hyden, an author and music critic who co-hosts Uproxx's indie rock podcast Indiecast. \"That added to the allure. It really feels like a mixtape of songs that might have been hits 40 or 50 years ago, but no one has heard yet. That was the quality that a lot of people responded to. And even though Patrick did have this history in indie rock, there was a feeling like it came out of nowhere.\" \u00a0\nWhen, last October, a more conventional download was made available to buy on Bandcamp, an online record store and music community that connects independent artists with loyal, paying fans, it proved incredibly popular; then a couple of weeks ago, it was finally given a physical release on vinyl and CD. \"Pretty instantly it was one of the biggest selling items on the site,\" says Aly Gillani,\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Bandcamp's European\u00a0Artist\u00a0and\u00a0Label\u00a0Representative and founder of independent label First Word Records. \"It's sold very well, and continues to.\"\nIt has been helped along by vociferous praise from the online US music press; one site, Aquarium Drunkard, called Diamond Jubilee \"a throwback to a different, weirder, cooler, better era in independent music\". Leading online magazine Pitchfork gave the album a score of 9.1, their highest for a new album in four years, propelling Cindy Lee forward in a way reminiscent of the site's taste-making 00s heyday, when its reviews habitually helped break indie acts like Arcade Fire. Meanwhile The Guardian voted Diamond Jubilee the second best album of 2024, behind only Charli xcx's cultural behemoth and dance-pop masterpiece Brat.\u00a0\nThere was something incongruous about seeing Diamond Jubilee and Brat side by side. Brat was the epitome of a 21st Century album, with a very 21st Century album campaign: aggressively marketed and cleverly hyper-self-aware, its domination of online discourse via memes and viral social media moments worked so well that its branding reached Kamala Harris. Diamond Jubilee, on the other hand, has rejected almost all prevailing theories about how music should be sold and consumed in the modern era, prompting a debate on wider music industry practices and the fan-artist relationship that goes far beyond the record itself.\nFor a certain type of music fan \u2013 highly engaged and record buying \u2013 the act of discovery was a huge part of Diamond Jubilee's appeal, not to mention the commitment needed to source and then digest Flegel's ambitious artistic vision. \"It does lean into that desire that some music fans have to go back to how things used to be,\" Gillani says, \"when they could find an album and get excited and really dig into it, rather than constantly jump to the next one. There's a yearning from people to experience great artistry directly.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"People felt like they were getting in on the ground floor in a way that you don't get much on the internet these days,\" Hyden says. \"And with a feeling this record wasn't being shoved down people's throats by social media or labels or corporate media, it all combined to make it feel like it was a special event, although still a niche event.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nOf course, artists finding different ways to sell and promote their music is nothing new. From Beyonc\u00e9 \u00a0surprise-dropping 2013's self-titled fifth album to Jack White's rollout of last year's No Name record \u2013 White initially gave away unmarked vinyl copies in plastic bags to unwitting customers in his Third Man Records shops \u2013 an inventive approach can ignite a campaign. \"If you're a larger artist with a platform, you can afford to take risks that maybe smaller artists can't,\" Gillani says, while adding, nevertheless, that unknown musicians can sometimes use an off-kilter release strategy to powerful effect.\nGillani points to secretive London neo-soul collective Sault, who for years never confirmed their identify, also refused interviews and once simultaneously made five albums available for free download in a five-day window. \"Both Cindy Lee and Sault did things you would not necessarily advise,\" Gillani says, \"and it definitely helped that the music is exceptional. But as a music fan, that captures my imagination. And doing something like that can be a really effective way of bypassing all of the things that you quote unquote 'have' to do to release music.\"\nThe theory goes that if people have to work harder to hear something, it is more rewarding. \"You want people to connect with it on an emotional level,\" Gillani says. \"And I think by creating some barriers to that, yes, it's a risk, because they might not get through the barriers. But if they do, that emotional connection is doubled, tripled. That's hard to beat.\" And despite what it may look like, Gillani insists Diamond Jubilee was indeed marketed. \"It's a high-risk strategy, absolutely, but it is still a strategy nonetheless.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThough it's not one you see often in our oversharing, content-saturated online world: an artist giving the impression they're not fussed if their music is heard or not. Expensive PR campaigns with a strong social media presence are the norm for artists desperately vying for our attention. \"Back in the 80s and 90s, artists weren't brazenly chasing clout in a way they do now,\" Hyden says. \"I'm not blaming artists now for chasing clout, because we're in an environment where you're just trying to have your music heard through a huge trough of content online. But Patrick not chasing that was a throwback.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nFlegel's rejection of streaming \u2013 they once stated on their website about Spotify CEO Daniel Ek that \"[HE] IS A THIEF AND A WAR PIG\" \u2013 taps into a growing debate about the state of the music industry, and the economics of streaming in particular (one can only imagine what Flegel thought when an illegal upload of Diamond Jubilee was suddenly available on Spotify, only to be quickly taken down). On top of a worldwide cost-of-touring crisis \u2013 a new survey by Ditto Music states that 84% of UK independent artists can no longer afford to tour \u2013 smaller artists who have seen physical sales decline now see next to no financial reward from streaming. Spotify reportedly pays between $0.003 - $0.005 per stream, which is then split between all rights holders (which could include labels and publishers as well as artists).\nWhile the advantages for users are obvious \u2013 cost and convenience \u2013 it has seen the work of artists devalued. \"Spotify has become a pretty inhospitable place for artists who don't get a lot of streams,\" Hyden says. \"People treat Spotify like it's Netflix. And it's like, if the movie isn't on Netflix, then the movie doesn't exist. There's an illusion that that's the whole world. You would hope that people would take from Diamond Jubilee that not everything that there is to be heard is on streaming platforms. There's a lot of artists that operate outside of that because they choose to.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Kendrick Lamar's road to the Super Bowl\n\u2022 The 2024 drinking song that became a giant US hit\n\u2022 How Espresso became the song of the summer\nIn-keeping with their initial album campaign, or lack of it, Cindy Lee has shown no interest in capitalising on their higher profile. Even before their US tour was cancelled midway through at short notice for undisclosed personal reasons last May, a message on their website read \"THIS WILL BE CINDY LEE'S LAST AMERICAN TOUR\". Critics who saw the shows that did happen, 45-minute solo-sets where Flegel, in their Cindy Lee aesthetic of beehive wig and gold dress, played to a backing track, reported a rapt audience watching a phenomenal guitar talent: Flegel played \"with a casual mastery I'd imagined was reserved for those who've made deals with the devil,\" wrote NPR's Meaghan Garvey. But a reticence to perform was also noted: Stereogum's Ian Cohen reported in San Diego that Flegel commented onstage \"I feel like a caged fucking animal\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Patrick being uncomfortable with the exposure has kept Cindy's profile on that cult level,\" Hyden says. \"And maybe that's where it should be. Maybe some things are just meant for an audience of connoisseurs and appreciators. But we're not used to that way of thinking in the internet age. Before the internet, if you were in the indie world, it was understood that you weren't trying to reach that mass audience, and that allowed you to engage in a different kind of way. Now everyone's on the same platform. So if you're the person who is only getting 100,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, you get talked about in the media like you don't really matter, because they're comparing it with Coldplay.

        "article_text": "Robbie Williams has invited Scottish Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus to sing a duet with him on the first date of his tour in Edinburgh.\nThe Rock DJ singer will embark on a highly-anticipated European tour which starts in Murrayfield on 31 May.\nMcManus, who won the televised singing competition in 2003, was interviewing Williams on her Afternoons show on BBC Radio Scotland when he surprised her with the invitation.\nHe asked her: \"Would you like to come and sing with me in Edinburgh?\"\nShe replied: \"What, sorry? What was that?\"\nWilliams repeated his question and McManus, from Glasgow, can be heard starting to cry.\n\"Is this a joke?\" she said. \"For goodness sake, yes!\"\n\"Let's do it,\" said Williams. \"We'll sort out what song later.\"\nThe singer is set to perform some of his most popular songs on tour including Angels and She's the One, as well as new songs from his recent biopic.\nHe has previously performed duets with the likes of Kylie Minogue, Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift.\nBetter Man tells the story of Robbie Williams and his rise to fame - but he is portrayed by an anthropomorphic chimpanzee. \nThe film was released in December and depicts the early days of Take That as well as his struggles with drug addiction and mental health.\nMcManus told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that she assumed Williams was going to ask her for food recommendations in Edinburgh.\n\"At no point ever in my wildest dreams did I think he was about to ask me what he did,\" she said.\n\"I cried a lot after it happened. It's the enormity of being onstage in Murrayfield in front of about 70,000 people with Robbie Williams.\n\"But it's also the magnitude of the kindness. Robbie has been so incredibly kind to me on so many different occasions even though he's such a megastar.\"\nMcManus said she got to know Williams in the early 2000s after she won Pop Idol.\n\"Robbie had just done Knebworth and he was absolutely huge with a solo career,\" she said.\n\"He was getting a lot of really horrible stuff written about him in the press. As soon as Pop Idol came along, I got a lot of that as well.\n\"It was so intense at the time about how unattractive I was, about how overweight I was. He was a huge fan of reality TV and noticed that we were both getting a lot of column inches.\"\nMcManus said Williams reached out to her after her time on Pop Idol with some advice on dealing with the negativity.\nShe added: \"I cried a lot with him at the time and it never left me because he gave me some great advice and it really helped me get through that initial period.\"\nWhen asked what she would like to sing with him, McManus said: \"That man could hand me the phone book and I'd sing it for him, I don't care because it's Robbie Williams.\n\"Obviously I want to Lulu it right up - but I don't think he'll do Relight My Fire because why would he? With the back catalogue that man's got, I'm not going to ask him to whip out a Take That number.\n\"I'll give it my best shot. He knows I'm a big belter.\"\nShe told BBC Scotland that it was especially meaningful to sing in front of a Scottish crowd with someone who has been \"really important to me throughout all of my career\".\nIn 2014, McManus was invited to sing with Rod Stewart at the Hydro in Glasgow to celebrate 50 years of the Lisbon Lions - the Celtic team that won the European Cup in Portugal in 1967.\nShe also performed alongside Susan Boyle for Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to Glasgow in 2010.\nBut she added: \"To get to this point 22 years after I won the competition, this is probably the biggest thing I've been asked to do. \n\"I'm still in shock. My heart is bursting.\"",

We are going to go out to dinner with our partners. We are going to do it.\"\nDiscussing their conversation pre-surgery, she said: \"The temptation, of course, was to say to him: 'I've got three children. Please, please keep me alive.'\n\"But that is quite a stress for the surgeon.\n\"It's an immense pressure and what he needs to know is that I have faith in him.\n\"I know that he is the best at his job. I know that he wants to do the best for me.\n\"So I said to him: 'You do whatever you need to do. I put all my faith in you.' He doesn't need me screaming at him to keep me alive.\n\"He needs to be in the calmest and most confident place. I wanted to empower Kevin to do the best job he could.\"\nMr O'Neill, 62, said of the former Big Brother host: \"Davina is a special person.\n\"Some people are so terrified they can't make a decision [about what to do when diagnosed].\"\nDespite his experience, the neurosurgeon said he found the procedure stressful \"because she was high profile and her career rests on her memory\".\nDescribing himself as \"spiritual\", he added: \"I prayed in the run-up. And just before, on holiday in Venice, I dropped my glasses and when I went to pick them up, I bent down and saw a card with my birthday printed on it. I saw it as a good sign.\"\nNon-cancerous brain tumours are more common in people over the age of 50, and symptoms can include headaches, vision problems and drowsiness, according to the NHS website.\nSome can be difficult to remove without damaging surrounding tissue. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy can also be used if the surgery is not successful.\nMother-of-three McCall said that although she was told to expect a good outcome, minor risks of death or losing her short-term memory from the operation meant that she decided to put her affairs in order before the procedure.\n\"I set up my whole life before I went into the operating theatre knowing that, if I didn't make it, the kids would be OK,\" she said.\n\"I needed to go under the anaesthetic knowing I had my ducks in a row.\n\"It was my way of letting go. And I am so grateful for that process, because I realised through all of it that, if I were not around, my children would be on the right path.\n\"If this hadn't happened to me, I'd have stayed in 'mum mode'. I love my kids so much, but I looked at them and thought: 'Would they be OK without me?' And the answer was yes, and that made me so proud.\n\"I've always been a grateful person but this brain operation has supersized my gratitude.\"\nMcCall spent time in intensive care before returning home, where she was cared for by family including her partner, celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas.\nA longtime advocate of women's health, McCall was given a special recognition award at the National Television Awards last year after having been awarded an MBE in 2023 for services to broadcasting.",

        "article_text": "It may have been drowned out this week as US President Donald Trump walked back tariffs on his closest neighbours - and biggest trading partners - almost as soon as they were in place.\nBut despite the dizzying back-and-forth with Canada and Mexico, the White House  made clear that it is serious about its economic vision. And it is willing to pay the price of some short-term economic harm to pursue it.\n\"There'll be a little disturbance,\" Trump warned in his address to Congress on Tuesday. \"But we're okay with that.\"\nSome scepticism about that comfort might be understandable, given the abrupt policy turns on tariffs Trump has made, as financial markets dropped and the outcry from US businesses intensified.\nThose who see Trump's tariff threats as economic bluster might be tempted to conclude that he wants to talk tough, but flinches at the first signs of economic damage.\nBut that view is to some extent undermined by the trade war against China he started in his first term which has seriously intensified. \nIn just a few weeks, Trump has raised taxes to at least 20% on all Chinese imports.\nIt means the average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, because taxes on some sectors - like electric vehicles and steel - stand at much higher rates.\nThe 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods hasn't completely gone away either. The levy still stands on goods that aren't compliant with a trade deal that Trump negotiated in his first term - and so some goods coming from both neighbours will still be subject to it.\nThe White House also says its much-touted reciprocal tariffs targeting nearly all US trade partners are still in the pipeline. The details, they say, will be unveiled on 2 April, with rates tailor-made to address whatever policies other countries impose that officials consider unfair - whether in the form of taxes on US tech firms, Value-Added Taxes, or other import rules.\n\"It's a certainty \u2013 reciprocal tariffs are coming,\" Trump's senior adviser on trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro told business broadcaster CNBC on Friday.\nHe said the White House had seen signs that its threats alone were prompting car companies to start taking action and bolster their supply chains in the US - exactly the kind of investment that Donald Trump says his tariffs will spur.\n\"They're getting the picture,\" Navarro said.\nNavarro and others say the nitty-gritty of tariff rates is not their focus. Rather, they are using trade levies as a means to create a new version of America, where the country has a different relationship with its global partners. \nThat America has more local manufacturing, a smaller government and pays less for the military defence of its allies.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent - a former Wall Street hedge fund boss not known as a tariff hawk - this week pointed to political discussions in Germany about boosting its military spending as an \"early, big win\".\n\"The international trading system consists of a web of relationships - military economic, political. One cannot take a single aspect in isolation,\" he said, as he tried to sell the administration's strategy to a tariff-sceptical audience at the Economic Club of New York.\n\"This is how President Trump sees the world - not as a zero-sum game but as inter-linkages that can be re-ordered to advance the interests of American people.\"\nFor Trump, tariffs are a key tool for re-ordering that web. And the treasury secretary made clear that the likely short-term harm - higher prices - is an acceptable trade-off. \n\"Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,\" Bessent said.\nFor now, polls indicate Trump's voter base remains behind him. But how the next months unfold - and what happens in particular with consumer prices - could prove a real test of that message.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump.\nThe former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. \nIn much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"  \nCarney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nCarney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. \nThe Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. \nCarney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.\nLoud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital.  \nThe party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. \nCarney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\nThe governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country\nAt the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.\nThey have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.\nMuch of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. \nThe US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy.\nCarney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was \"attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses\". \n\"We can't let him succeed,\" he added, as the crowd booed loudly.\nHe said his government would keep tariffs on US imports \"until the Americans show us respect\".\nCanada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed.\n\"I know these are dark days,\" Carney said. \"Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. \n\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\nCarney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.\nThe US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.\n\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney. \n\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"\nShortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.\nHe warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.\nThe Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".\nThey accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.\nPoilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. \nCarney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December.\nFederal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he \"embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues\". \n\"I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election.\" \nThe Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. \nThe former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left.\nA major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years.\nHe has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US.\nDuring the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",

        "article_text": "There's a secret side of YouTube, just beyond the guiding hand of the algorithm \u2013 and it\u2019s nothing like what you know. The vast majority of YouTube's estimated 14.8 billion videos have almost never been seen. Until now.\nThis year marks YouTube's 20th birthday. From its humble beginnings as a venue for amateurs, today YouTube is such a behemoth that the company calls itself the new Hollywood. YouTube is the world's number one TV streaming service, where users clock billions of hours of watching every day. Leading YouTubers regularly outperform big-name studios. For comparison, an estimated 823 million cinema tickets were sold across all of the US and Canada in 2024. Meanwhile, MrBeast's most successful video alone racked up 762 million views, about one watch for every 10 people on earth. \u00a0\nThat's the vision of YouTube the company promotes \u2013 slick, professional, entertaining and loud \u2013 but from one perspective, it's all a fa\u00e7ade.\nThrough another lens, the essence of YouTube is more like this video from 2020. Before I watched, it had only been seen twice. A man points the camera out of his bedroom window as a flurry breaks out in the dead of winter. \"Here it is,\" he says. \"The falling snow.\" The sound of a TV plays in the background. A bird lands on a nearby fence. 19 minutes go by. Nothing happens.\n\"The conversations we're having about YouTube are based on an impoverished view of what the platform really is,\" says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US. \"When we just focus on what's popular, we miss how the vast majority of people actually use YouTube as uploaders, and overlooking the role it plays in our society.\"\nI spent the last month dipping into one of the first truly random samples of YouTube ever collected outside the company. I saw a side of the internet that sometimes feels lost, one full of pure, unvarnished self-expression. It's an entire world that YouTube's all-seeing algorithm won't show you.\n\"YouTube isn't just a vehicle for professionals,\" McGrady says. \"We rely on it as the default video arm of the internet. YouTube is infrastructure. It's a critical tool that regular people use to communicate.\"\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our stories on:\n\u2022\u00a0YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 The YouTube videos that changed the way we think about ourselves\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\nTo unveil this side of YouTube, McGrady and his colleagues built a tool that dials videos at random. The scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs before it collected a big enough sample for real scientific analysis. Among the findings the researchers estimate that the median video has been watched just 41 times; posts with more than 130 views are actually in the top third of the service's most popular content. In other words, the vast majority of YouTube is practically invisible.\nMost of these videos aren't meant for us to see. They exist because people need a digital attic to store their memories. It's an internet unshaped by the pressures of clicks and algorithms \u2013 a glimpse into a place where content doesn't have to perform, where it can simply exist.\nTwelve years ago, a woman from the US named Emily posted a YouTube video called \"sw33t tats\". I learned it's even older than that, recorded around 2008. In the video, Emily, who asked to withhold her full name, sits in her college dorm room. She pries her mouth open as her younger sister brings a marker to the inside of Emily's lower lip.\n\"Stop moving!\", her sister yells as she starts to write, the girls barely able to control their laughter. Emily holds her lip open to the camera, and her sister does the same, revealing a sweet tat of her own. But the footage is blurry; whatever these fake tattoos said is lost to time.\nEmily, now 34 and living in New York City, forgot this video existed until I asked her about it. \"I don't even remember why I uploaded this,\" she says. \"I think wanted to send it to my sister, but I also I had to free up space on my hard drive. I just needed a place to put it. I don't know, it's funny and weird. I'm glad it's still here.\"\n\"We tend to assume the reason to use social media is to try to be an influencer, either you're Joe Rogan or you're a failure. But that's the wrong way to think about it,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, who leads the YouTube research as the director of the University of Massachusetts' Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure.\nYouTube tells the BBC it's incorrect to say the platform doesn't let you see videos with low views or content from small channels. The algorithm's job is to help people find the videos they want to watch and that will give them value, YouTube says, and sometimes that does include videos with a small number of views.\n\"The magic of YouTube is that whether a video has 60 views or six million, people are able to find community, learn a new skill, be entertained, or share their voice with the world,\" says Boot Bullwinkle, a YouTube spokesperson. \"Every channel starts from the same blank slate, from which they can build an audience and grow a business.\"\nZuckerman and his colleagues weren't the first to go looking for YouTube's underbelly. Between 2009 and 2012, for instance, iPhones included a feature that let users post videos straight to YouTube with a few taps. YouTube reported that mobile uploads jumped 400% a day. Unless people added a custom title, the name for all these videos followed a standard format, which makes them easily searchable over a decade later. A few online tinkerers have explored these videos, which apparently number in the millions. One even built a custom player that cycles through them.\nWithout the algorithm's recommendations, you'll find that YouTube is a study of the everyday, Zuckerman says, people documenting small moments in their lives and using the available tools to exchange ideas.\nIn South Asia, for example, Zuckerman says YouTube and similar networks seem to function as a video messaging tool for people with low or no literacy. Most of YouTube comes from outside of the US, in fact. Zuckerman's lab has estimated that over 70% of YouTube videos are in languages other than English. You find fisherman in South America waving from a boat, or two construction workers speaking in Hindi about how much they miss home. Videos like these fall under what he calls \"friends and family\" content, where comments and interactions all come from people who seem to know the user personally.\n\"If any of these videos went viral, it would mean something went terribly wrong. That's not what most of YouTube for,\" Zuckerman says.\nMost unwatched YouTube is less entertaining than sw33t tats, which, with respect to Emily, sets a low bar. This stuff is bland enough to melt your brain. A bride gets ready for a photo shoot. A grouchy Korean man rants about politics. Six seconds of a martial arts instructor, devoid of context. Dash camera footage from a car struggling to escape a parking lot. A woman advertises a horse for sale in 2018. Endless, mundane screen recordings of video games \u2013 the University of Massachusetts Amhurst study found people playing video games seems to make up almost 20% of YouTube. \u00a0\nOccasionally, you stumble on something fun, or more often, just plain weird. Three men performatively slapping each other's rear ends to a James Brown song. A woman reviews a brand of pre-sliced bologna (it's \"not too bad\"). Or take the channel \"Space Stuff and Other Stuff\", where a kid raps about the planet Neptune and shares his condolences after Queen Elizabeth's passing. The latter falls in the \"other stuff\" category, apparently.\nSome videos are heartrending. I listened to an elderly man describe how he's living in a car on a farm, trading manual labour for a place to stay. There was a moving tribute to a departed cat from her owner, Tyler. \"Kiko didn't make it,\" he says, holding back tears. \"It's so darn quiet without her here.\" A few dozen videos I paused to watch a young ballerina float delicately across a stage, wafting back and forth in front of a hushed crowd.\n\"As researchers, we spend a lot of time with this stuff. It can be a lot like looking at people's personal snapshots,\" Zuckerman says. \"Most of it's boring, but sometimes it's poignant, even haunting. And every so often, you get something that feels incredibly revealing about how human beings communicate.\"\nBut my favourite videos by far came from Bill \"The WoofDriver\" Hellman. He's a 58-year-old working in real estate just outside of Baltimore, US. But that's not his passion. What Hellman really cares about is his dogs, and the unique way he cares for them. \"You've never seen anything like this before,\" he says in one video. I guarantee that he's right.\nHellman has built over 50 custom-made vehicles that he uses to take his four huskies out for what he calls \"urban mushing\". He uses social media to document their adventures on the trails of the eastern US. It all looks a bit like the dog sled races of the Iditarod. Except here, the dogs are usually strapped to the side of his various slow-moving contraptions, recumbent bicycles and electric dog-walking carts. By the looks of it Hellman's dogs are thrilled to participate.\nHe's posted more than 2,400 YouTube videos in the last 14 years, many of which include original rock songs. (Hellman says he's written more than 100 WoofDriver songs, in fact.) He puts in a lot of work, heading out with drones and groups of friends to document his journeys. Hellman's even paid for celebrity endorsements through the platform Cameo to promote his videos. But for all the effort, his channel often gets little traction. Many videos have views in the low double digits.\n\"I don't get a big audience a lot of the time, but that doesn't bother me. I was just so in love with how happy it made the dogs that at some point I thought 'I gotta share this',\" Hellman says. \"Maybe it'll inspire someone to take better care of their dogs, but really, I use YouTube like the cloud, so I have a place to document my adventures.\"\nYouTube doesn't pay the bills, and the WoofDriver isn't selling anything \u2013 though he's happy to give you the dimensions if you want to build your own urban dog sled. \"I just do it because of the joy it brings me,\" Hellman says.\nRandom YouTube usually doesn't look like the highly produced videos of the WoofDriver, but he's a good representation in one sense. Like Hellman's content, the majority of these unseen YouTube videos range from neutral to overwhelmingly positive.\nThe same can't be said for what rises to the top. Research suggests YouTube's algorithm amplifies negativity, reinforces stereotypes and gives users little control over the content they don't want to see. Over the years, YouTube has faced increasing criticism over concerns about hate speech, political extremism and misinformation. Along with other social media platforms, YouTube has been utilised by drug cartels and harnessed by terrorists as a tool for promotion and recruitment.\nYouTube says that the company has employed a set of community guidelines since its earliest days to establish what's allowed on the platform. The company says it has redoubled efforts to address its responsibilities. One way YouTube measures its success is through its \"violative view rate\". In 2017, for every 10,000 views on YouTube, 63-72 views came from content that violated YouTube policies, but today that number has fallen to eight to nine views, according to the company.\nYouTube says it gives users several ways to manage YouTube recommendations and search results, such as deleting your Watch History.\nWhen the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure set out to study YouTube, part of the impetus was to document how common hate speech and misinformation is on the platform. \"If you go looking for it, you'll find it,\" McGrady says, but compared to the total body of videos on YouTube it's exceedingly unusual. Still, it doesn't matter how rare a damaging video is if it gets a ton of views, McGrady says, and harmful content remains a serious issue on YouTube.\nIn recent years, Google has faced a wave of scrutiny from policy makers, with new laws and a mountain of proposed regulations \u2013 not to mention a series of antitrust cases. But when the regulatory conversation turns to the videos on YouTube themselves, the focus is almost always on content that goes viral, McGrady says.\nThis ignores the obligations YouTube should have because, according to McGrady, the company is running a piece of essential infrastructure.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022 Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\n\"The internet is deeply troubled, and we can't ignore the way tech companies are exacerbating those problems,\" McGrady says. \"What makes me hopeful is that when you find a way to look at how people are really using the web, a lot of it still feels like the early internet. It's expression, communication, connection. Fundamentally, it's a place where regular people share themselves and do wonderful things.\"\nThe YouTube we talk about \u2013 the one full of celebrities, scandals and manufactured virality \u2013 only tells part of the story. The majority exists in quiet moments, in shaky camera work and voices meant for no one in particular. \u00a0I watched hundreds of these videos. Everything one of them is public, but it's also clear that most people didn't upload this content for strangers. It was like being let in on a secret, a sprawling, uncurated documentary of human life. But watching it also felt like work compared to the doomscroll-inducing entertainment you get from the algorithm. Eventually, I closed my tabs and headed back to the YouTube homepage, back to the polished world of the corporate internet.\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "article_text": "From speeches watched by millions to a position as her party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars.\nHowever, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was \"flailing through life\" and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC.\nBlack believes it was only through a \"life-changing\" diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life.  \nThe former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.   \nBlack stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20.\nShe said her decision came after years in a \"toxic\" and \"bullying\" environment that was \"consuming my entire life\", with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018.   \n\"Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried,\" she told the BBC's Scotcast podcast.\nThe interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again.\nShe said: \"I couldn't go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went. \n\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"\nThe documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.\nShe describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.     \n\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.\nFor Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.\nShe told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.\n\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"\nBlack compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.\n\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.\nHowever, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.\nShe recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.\n\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"\nBlack recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough. \nShe said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"\nElected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".\nBlack felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\". \nShe added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive. \nShe said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.\n\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"\nBlack added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.  \nForbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.\nBlack was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.\nIt came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.\nBlack had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.\nDefeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.\n\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.\nIt did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.\nHowever, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.\nIn 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".\n\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.\n\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland. \n\"It was like two in the morning and the phrase used was a 'an imminent death threat'.\n\"I don't know what I've done to make you viscerally hate me that much.\"\nSince politics she has performed a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival and spent time talking about politics on various TV shows and podcasts.\nThere does not appear to be any second guessing about her decision to stand down though, as she enjoys a walk with her dog in the new documentary.\n\"People deserve a representative that wants to be there and I don't think that's me anymore.

Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.Youngest MP Mhairi Black's maiden speechBlack was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",

        "article_text": "Danny Dyer is back on the big screen with a film about a bloke trying to win back his missus.\nMarching Powder follows the story of Jack Jones (Dyer), a football hooligan who feels increasingly irrelevant.\nAfter some violent match day behaviour, Jack is arrested and given six weeks to turn his life around - or face prison. He also has to try to save his marriage.\nBut the real Danny Dyer met his partner when they were 13. They've been together more than 30 years, married for eight of them, and he likes to think he's a bit of a romantic.\nSo, what love lessons can we learn from the former EastEnders actor?\n\"I'm a snorer,\" Dyer admits.\n\"You know what, snoring is just bad luck. Me and my wife have been around a long time and we have separate beds and the reason for that is, I unfortunately roar in the night.\"\nThe 47-year-old says it's rare to have been with your partner for over 30 years at his age. \"We're bringing up grandchildren \u2013 it's a beautiful thing. My clan's getting bigger and I've become more responsible now.\n\"I feel like I've grown up slightly and become an adult.\"\n\"Listen, I think it's a bit of a myth that I've played the hard man role,\" Dyer says. \"In EastEnders, I played an alpha male that wore a pink dressing gown.

It's about being a decent human being.\n\"There's nothing wrong with being masculine. But as men, we need to open up to each other and stand up to our mates and go, 'no, I'm not coming out tonight \u2013 I'm going to spend a nice evening with my wife'.\n\"Me and my wife are actually going to therapy, couples' help groups. And you know, your mates are all laughing but you go \u2013 no, no I love her.\"\nWhen it comes to his romantic playlist, Dyer loves the somewhat unlikely combo of Luther Vandross and Jeff Buckley. \n\"Everybody Here Wants You \u2013 whack that on,\" he says. And what's his best chat up line? He replies immediately.\n\"Well, I'm Danny Dyer. I don't need one. Whatever that means. Well, you know, fame and stuff, I don't think I've ever needed to use a chat up line.\n\"Obviously I've been with my missus for so long and I went through a period where I was quite desirable to women, and all of a sudden I've become desirable again, even though I'm a grandad, a balding sort of lumpy grandad.\"\nDyer says his wife has grown with him and kept him grounded. \"She's a very special human being and she's never really been fazed by my work.\"\nHe says he comes from a working class family and the Marching Powder screening was \"full of the working class lot that love our movies.

This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.\nThe government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth. \nThe UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.\nIvy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.\nThe firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.\n\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"\nDr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet. \nIt doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.\nIn this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.\n\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me. \n\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"\nThe FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods. \nProf May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.\n\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"\nBut Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.\n\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.\n\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House ahead of a special crypto summit on Friday, Sacks said that it was a \"real shame that we did not maximise value for the American taxpayer.\" \n\"What we want to do is make sure that with the remaining Bitcoin that we have,\" he added. \nNonetheless, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, called Thursday's announcement \"a pig in lipstick\" in response to Sacks' post on X.\n\"No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government,\" he said.\nTrump's executive order says that the Treasury and Commerce secretary will come up with strategies for acquiring more government Bitcoin, provided these are \"budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers\".\nThat meant, Sacks told reporters, they are only \"allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.\" \nJason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a \"horrible precedent\" and \"makes no sense.\"\n\"Without a clear framework, we risk arbitrary asset selections, which would distort the markets and drive a loss of public trust,\" he suggested.\nOther analysts though have been more positive.\n\"This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\"It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globe's reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence.\"\nFurther details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House.\nIt is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it \"will not cost taxpayers a dime\". \nIt is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.\nThe US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset.

No exceptions have so far been made. \n\"We'll take in that report, and then the Secretary of the Treasury will be setting up accounts within the charging department, one for Bitcoin and one for all other digital assets,\" he said. \nTrump aggressively courted the crypto community during his presidential campaign.

        "article_text": "Ireland allowed 34 unanswered points between the 43rd and 74th minutes of their loss to France\nIn the end, it was the most ill-fitting of send-offs.\nAs a video tribute to Ireland's retiring trio of legends appeared on the big screens at the Aviva Stadium after a 42-27 Six Nations defeat by France, the majority of a crowd that had felt decidedly blue-tinged throughout had already departed into the Dublin streets.\nMany of them were likely left trying to process what they had witnessed across the previous 40 minutes. \nPeter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Cian Healy may have 374 caps' worth of Ireland experience, but even that most seasoned group of stalwarts would struggle to recall any recent spell where Ireland were so thoroughly bested. \nSimon Easterby's side came in with the 2025 Triple Crown already secured, chasing both a Grand Slam and the first ever hat-trick of outright titles in the competition.\nWhen, with 37 minutes remaining of the game, they had overturned their third half-time deficit of the championship thanks to Dan Sheehan's converted score, that potential history still stretched ahead of them. \nYet across the scintillating spell that followed, France scored 34 straight points to gain the upper hand in the game, the Six Nations title race and, perhaps, the competition's defining rivalry of the past four seasons. \nIreland Grand Slam hopes ended by rampant France\nIreland coach Easterby questions second French try\nFrance win in Dublin to take control of Six Nations\nThis video can not be played\nDominant France win to end Ireland's Grand Slam hopes\nShould France go on and win the championship against Scotland next weekend, it will be that half hour that is viewed as the defining passage of their campaign, their remarkable blend of power and flair all the more impressive for occurring after star player and captain Antoine Dupont had departed injured. \nSuch was their dominance through the period it was easy to forget that, with Fabien Galthie having opted for a 7-1 bench split, they did it all with La Rochelle flanker Oscar Jegou playing centre. \n\"We've seen it from them before,\" said Ireland skipper Caelan Doris of facing Les Bleus during such a purple patch.\n\"We've experienced it first hand, but we've also seen it against other teams so far in this campaign. \n\"It was a big message for us this week, stopping them on the gain-line and not allowing them to get quick ball.\n\"We weren't good enough in that area.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrance score 'irresistible' try\nAlthough Ireland only gave away six penalties, there were plenty more occasions when France were able to play with greater freedom thanks to a penalty advantage. \nIf that was one way in which the visitors were able to get on such a roll, Ireland's interim head coach Simon Easterby felt their dominance in the collisions was another.\n\"They're as good as anyone when they get behind you and they get on the front foot,\" he said after his first defeat filling in for Andy Farrell.\n\"It's probably down a large part to the collisions that we weren't able to put in place ourselves, but also credit to the way that they play the game as well.\"\nAcross the past four seasons, these sides have now won two head to heads each, both having done so once away from home.\nBarring a French stumble next weekend, it will likely be a pair of titles apiece too.\nYet, rarely, across the period has one team felt so superior to the other, even for only half an hour.\nIreland will surely point to areas where they could be and normally are better. \nFor the second game in succession they played 20 minutes a man down with Joe McCarthy's first-half yellow card feeling particularly avoidable. \nThey lacked any clinical edge during their own period of ascendancy too. \nGiven France's final try came off a Damian Penaud intercept from within the shadow of his own posts, it is fair to say that France scored the same seven points as Ireland did from the latter's visits to the opposition 22 across the first 75 minutes of the game.\nPeter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray were all playing their final home Test for Ireland\nAfter their win over Wales to secure the Triple Crown last month, Easterby said this Ireland team was motivated to \"chase down things which maybe other teams can't do\".\nFor the second Six Nations campaign in a row, such ambitions have been quashed in round four.\nLast year, the bid for back to back Grand Slams was scuppered by England in Twickenham. \nHere, hopes of an unprecedented third consecutive outright title fell by the wayside. While there remain outside chances of salvaging a title from the wreckage, the emotional swing is surely huge. \nIreland have not lost consecutive games since 2021 and Doris was quick to try and turn the page to Italy in Rome next week.\nHe said: \"Regardless of how the table is shaping up we still want to get our best performance out there and finish on a high for the [retiring] lads and as a team on a whole.\"\nYet, for a team that has made no bones about the desire for a signature achievement, when including the failure to make it beyond the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 2023, there is an undeniable feeling that three have now slipped from their grasp in the space of just 17 months.

Yet across the scintillating spell that followed, France scored 34 straight points to gain the upper hand in the game, the Six Nations title race and, perhaps, the competition's defining rivalry of the past four seasons.",

        "article_text": "If you had asked Canadians a few months ago who would win the country's next general election, most would have predicted a decisive victory for the Conservative Party.\nThat outcome does not look so certain now.\nIn the wake of US President Donald Trump's threats against Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has surged in the polls, shrinking the double-digit lead their Conservative rivals had held steadily since mid-2023.\nThe dramatic change in the country's political landscape reflects how Trump's tariffs and his repeated calls to make Canada \"the 51st state\" have fundamentally altered Canadian voters' priorities.\nTrump's rhetoric has \"pushed away all of the other issues\" that were top of mind for Canadians before his inauguration on 20 January, notes Luc Turgeon, a political science professor at the University of Ottawa.\nIt has even managed to revive the once deeply unpopular Trudeau, whose approval rating has climbed by 12 points since December. The prime minister, of course, will not be in power for much longer, having announced his resignation at the start of the year.\nOn Sunday, his Liberals will declare the results of the leadership contest to determine who takes over a party running a precarious minority government. The new leader will have two immediate decisions to make: how to respond to Trump's threats, and when to call a general election. The answer to the first dilemma will surely influence the second.\nWho is in the running to replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?\nA federal election must be held on or before 20 October, but could be called as early as this week.\nPolls indicate that many Canadians still want a change at the top. But what that change would look like - a Liberal government under new leadership, or a complete shift to the Conservatives - is now anyone's guess, says Greg Lyle, president of the Toronto-based Innovative Research Group, which has been polling Canadians on their shifting attitudes.\n\"Up until now, it was a blowout for the Conservatives,\" he tells the BBC.\nThat is because the centre-right party led by Pierre Poilievre, has been effective in its messaging on issues that have occupied the Canadian psyche for the last few years: the rising cost of living, housing unaffordability, crime and a strained healthcare system.\nPoilievre successfully tied these societal problems to what he labelled Trudeau's \"disastrous\" policies, and promised a return to \"common sense politics\".\nBut with Trudeau's resignation, and Trump's threats to Canada's economic security and even its sovereignty, that messaging has become stale, Mr Lyle says. His polling suggests the majority of the country is now most afraid of Trump's presidency and the impact it will have on Canada.\nTrump's 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports to the US, some of which have been paused until 2 April, could be devastating for Canada's economy, which sends three-quarters of all its products to the US. Officials have predicted up to a million job losses as a result, and Canada could head into a recession if the tax on goods persists.\nTrudeau left no doubt how seriously he is taking the threat, when he told reporters this week that Trump's stated reason for the US tariffs - the flow of fentanyl across the border - was bogus and unjustified.\n\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" the prime minister warned.\n\"In many ways, it's an all encompassing, fundamental issue about the survival of the country,\" Prof Turgeon tells the BBC. Who is best placed to stand up for Canada against Trump has therefore become the key question in the forthcoming election.\nThe Conservatives are still ahead in the polls, with the latest averages suggesting 40% of voters back them. The Liberals' fortunes, meanwhile, have been revived, with their support climbing to slightly over 30% - up 10 points from January.\nLiberals have attempted to highlight similarities between the Conservative leader and Republican president. At last week's leadership debate, candidates referred to Poilievre as \"our little version of Trump here at home\" and said he was looking to \"imitate\" the US president. A Liberal Party attack ad juxtaposed clips of the two using similar phrases such as \"fake news\" and \"radical left\".\nThere are clear differences, however, between the two politicians, in terms of style and substance. And Trump himself has downplayed any parallels, telling British magazine The Spectator in a recent interview that Poilievre is \"not Maga enough\".\nStill, polls suggest a slipping of Conservative support. A recent poll by national pollster Angus Reid indicates Canadians believe Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney is better equipped to deal with Trump on issues of tariffs and trade than Poilievre. \nThe former central banker for both Canada and England is touting his experience dealing with economic crises, including the 2008 financial crash and Brexit.\nAnd the shift in the political mood has forced Conservatives to recalculate their messaging.\nIf the election is called soon, the campaign will take place at a moment when Trump's threats have inspired a fierce patriotism among Canadians. Many are boycotting American goods at their local grocery stores or even cancelling trips to the US.\nProf Turgeon says this \"rallying around the flag\" has become a key theme of Canadian politics.\nThe Conservatives have shifted away from their \"Canada is Broken\" slogan, which Mr Lyle says risked coming across as \"anti-patriotic\", to \"Canada First\".\nConservatives have also redirected their attacks towards Carney. Before Trump's tariffs, they ran ads saying he is \"just like Justin\" in an attempt to tie him to Trudeau. But in recent weeks, the Conservatives have started digging into Carney's loyalty to Canada.\nSpecifically, they have questioned whether he had a role in moving the headquarters of Brookfield Asset Management - a Canadian investment company - from Toronto to New York when he served as its chair.\nCarney has responded that he had left the firm by the time that decision was made, but company documents reported on by public broadcaster CBC show the board approved the move in October 2024, when Carney was still at Brookfield.\nThe move, and Carney's equivocation of his involvement with it, was criticised by the editorial board of Canada's national newspaper the Globe and Mail, which wrote on Thursday that Carney must be transparent with Canadians.\nMore broadly, the paper wrote: \"Every party leader must understand that Canada is entering a years-long period of uncertainty. The next prime minister will have to call on the trust of Canadians to lead the country where it needs to head but may not want to go.\"\nGiven the anxiety reverberating among Canadians, Mr Lyle says that any ambiguity about Carney's loyalty to the country could yet be damaging for him and the Liberals.\nWhenever the election comes, and whoever wins, one thing is certain: Trump will continue to influence and reshape Canadian politics just as he has in the United States.",

        "article_text": "Cyriel Dessers scored one goal, assisted another, and had two efforts disallowed against Fenerbahce\nJust short of the hour mark in Istanbul, after he had scored Rangers' first, brilliantly assisted their second, then came inches away, twice, from adding a third, Cyriel Dessers reminded you of a boxer, dancing around the ring, toying with a bewildered opponent.\nThe Fenerbahce backline were on the ropes. Their defences were down and so were their heads. They remonstrated with each other about this menace in their midst and their inability to stop him. Dessers was running amok.\nThere were many major performers on this night of nights for Rangers - all of them, quite frankly - but Dessers was one of the star turns.\nRangers folk have had a torrid relationship with him. A kind of Richard Burton-Elizabeth Taylor vibe if you are old enough to catch the drift, an on-off thing, love and hate, tempestuous, never dull.\nThe big man scored his fourth European goal of the season and delivered his fourth assist. He is on 22 goals this term now, to match the 22 he got last season. \n'Calm down, it's not over', Mourinho warns Rangers\nRangers earn stunning win over Fenerbahce\nRangers reaction, analysis & have your say\nIf you look back over Rangers' past 25 to 30 years, you'll see that Alfredo Morelos and Kris Boyd managed back-to-back 20-plus goal seasons in the top flight, but it is a pantheon with few heroes.\nThat's not a word many among the Rangers support would associate with Dessers. \nHe has spoken before about feeling written off only months into his first season at the club - last season - how his misses were more talked about than his goals and how it made him feel like the worst Rangers player ever. His description.\nOn Thursday, he looked like one of the best Rangers strikers of several decades. Classy, dangerous, resilient, he was inches away from an away European hat-trick. \nOne goal, one assist and one lovely cushioned pass to Nico Raskin before his sumptuous delivery to Vaclav Cerny for the goal that made it 3-1 was a mighty contribution from a maligned player who just keeps going no matter the doubt that rings in his ears from the stands.\nMaybe that has changed now. Or, perhaps, it is changing. Not there yet, but moving fast in the right direction. \nMaybe you could say the same about Rangers in Europe.\nThis tie isn't over, but they produced something very special in Istanbul and take a two-goal buffer to Glasgow next week. Nobody saw that coming. Absolutely nobody. \nThey were immense. Had they won by four instead of two then Jose Mourinho suggested that he could have had no complaints.\nThis was a glorious night for the 'Four Bears' - the interim coaching team of former Rangers men led by Barry Ferguson - and a continuation of the surreality that surrounds this collection of players.\nDefeats in recent weeks by Motherwell, St Mirren and Queen's Park in the Scottish Cup. A manager sacked. A support in uproar. A Glasgow rival laughing in their face, 16 points clear in the league and so far ahead on every metric that you wonder when, or if, the chasm between them will close.\nA team that struggles hopelessly when dealing with the low blocks of smaller clubs domestically - they have dropped points in 11 out of 29 league matches - and then delivers their very best stuff against better teams in European football.\nSigmund Freud could not get to the heart of this lot. He would end up on the couch himself with Carl Jung waving a fan and some smelling salts in his face.\nFrom joyless defeats at home against teams with fractions of their budget to steepling victories away against European big shots, this lays claim to be the oddest of all Rangers sides, the one that is capable of the most jaw-dropping extremes.\nThis video can not be played\n'Brilliant result but I'm not getting carried away' - Ferguson\nIs there one to rival them in the Rangers 'odditorium'? Club historians will have plenty to say on that. \nIn more recent memory, the Giovanni van Bronckhorst side of 2021-22 are worth a mention. They got to the Europa League final that season, only losing on penalties. \nThey beat the Borussia Dortmund of Mats Hummels, Raphael Guerreiro and Jude Bellingham then the RB Leipzig of Konrad Laimer, Josko Gvardiol, Dani Olmo and Dominik Szoboszlai.\nOne missed penalty in the final shootout against an Eintracht Frankfurt side later broken up and sold on for serious money was all that stopped them. \nAll of those massive nights against heavy-hitters in Europe and they had to settle for second place in the Scottish Premiership to Ange Postecoglou's new Celtic team.\nThere are big differences between that team and the Rangers of today, though. Van Bronckhorst's lot fought hard domestically, losing the league by just four points and winning the Scottish Cup.\nThey were never as far off the pace in Scotland as the current crew, and never displayed the kind of incredible turbulence that has been so pervasive this season.\nWinston Churchill described the geo-politics of the old Soviet Union as a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma - a description that could be stolen and applied to the twin personalities of this Rangers outfit.\nFenerbahce, like others before them, afforded Rangers time and space on the not unreasonable premise that a team not good enough to score against second-tier opposition in Scotland was hardly likely to cause them too many problems.\nBig mistake. Huge. They reckoned without the Jekyll and Hyde, the domestic Rangers and the European Rangers, the Rangers who have the devil's own job in breaking down defensive teams in the Premiership but who are like kids in candy stores in Europe when there is space and an ability to counter-attack.\nDessers typified the effort: strutting, lethal and head and shoulders ahead of more celebrated strikers down the other end.\nFerguson and his coaches deserve huge credit for a formation shift to three at the back, which worked well. For sending their team out with belief when those players had reason not to believe. \nAnd for delivering a massive result that sets up a pulse-quickening night at Ibrox next Thursday. Bonkers, but brilliantly so.",

        "article_text": "As the clocks go forward this spring, see if you can solve these puzzles based on ancient calendars.\nWhen the clocks change for Daylight Saving Time, it can often involve a bit more mental arithmetic than usual as we try to figure out our schedules. This is especially true for those of us trying to navigate different time zones.\nFor most of the US, the clocks go forward one hour on the second Sunday in March \u2013 unless you're in Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe Daylight Saving Time. Spare a thought for the Navajo Nation living in Arizona \u2013 they move to daylight savings time even though the rest of the state stays on standard time.\nAnd for those making transatlantic calls, the time difference is a little shorter for the next three weeks as the UK and the rest of Europe do not move to their summer time schedule until later in March. But even here there can be mental agility needed - the clocks at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, are a frequent cause of confusion for visitors as they remain on GMT throughout the summer.\nIn the ancient world, there were far more radical changes to the way people observed and formalised time. The changes to the calendars used by the Romans, for instance, led to seemingly impossible conundrums.\nTo help limber up your brain for the weeks ahead, we've put together the following time-based riddles with the advice of Helen Parish, professor of history at the University of Reading in the UK. Scroll to the bottom of the article for the answers \u2013 or if you'd like a clue, get some hints in this story first.\u00a0 \nPuzzle 1: The impossible letter\nA woman sits down to write a letter in France on 8 November 1582.\u00a0\nThree days earlier, the letter is received in England.\u00a0\nWhat happened?\nPuzzle 2: The mystery of the missing birthdays\nIn the year 46BC, in Rome, a child is born in spring.\u00a0\nShe lives to be 60 years old, though she never has another birthday again.\u00a0\nBut why?\nPuzzle 3: The strangely ageing farmhand\nAfter working in the fields on the last day of December 800BC, a farm labourer downs his tools and goes to bed.\u00a0\nOn the first day of the new year, when he picks up his tools to start work again, he is two months older.\u00a0\nHow can this be?\nThe impossible letter \u2013 Puzzle 1\nIn the 1500s, the old Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar. But different countries in Europe adopted the new calendar at different times \u2013 which meant the days across the continent were often out of sync, leaving some countries several days or weeks behind others.\nThe mystery of the missing birthdays \u2013 Puzzle 2\nRomans used to use extra months known as \"intercalary months\", which were added ad hoc to realign the 355-day Roman year with the solar year. The child in question was born in the intercalary month of Mercedonius. The last time the month of Mercedonius was used was spring 46BC, so the child was severely short-changed on birthdays.\nThe strangely ageing farmhand \u2013 Puzzle 3\nThe pre-Julian calendar only had 10 months, and didn't calendarise the roughly 60 days of wintertime when there was no agricultural work to be done. During this wintertime, there was no real concept of \"months\".\nBonus:\nEven in our modern world there are calendar quirks that mean some people live in multiple time zones where they can be several different ages at once. With a bit of border-hopping, it is also possible to travel back to the 1300s or forward to the 26th Century.

        "article_text": "Roman Dobrokhotov is used to looking over his shoulder.\nThe Russian journalist's investigations into Vladimir Putin's regime - one of which unmasked the agents responsible for the 2018 Salisbury poisonings - have made him a target of the Kremlin.\nBut as the Insider editor waited on the tarmac to board a commercial flight from Budapest to Berlin in 2021, where he was to give evidence in a murder trial, he didn't notice the brunette woman stood behind him.\nHe thought nothing of it when she took a seat close to his. Nor did he see the camera strapped to her shoulder, quietly recording.\nThat morning, the woman had flown from Luton to Budapest to locate the mark. Dobrokhotov's flight information had been obtained in advance.\nAs the aircraft approached its destination, the woman, a Bulgarian \u2013 Katrin Ivanova \u2013 sent a message on Telegram.\nThen two more.\nHer partner, Biser Dzhambazov, with whom she lived in Harrow, north London, was waiting for her and Dobrokhotov in Berlin.\nAnother woman, an airport worker identified only as Cvetka, had already flown a dummy run of the route.\nWaiting in Berlin, she was another pair of eyes.\nThey'd lost him.\nOperational for years, the cell tracked Russia's enemies across Europe. Its leaders plotted honeytraps, kidnap and murder in service of the Kremlin. Following a trial, three members were convicted on 7 March at the Old Bailey in London for their part in the conspiracy. Three more had already pleaded guilty.\n\"We're in a situation where only some of us will survive,\" Dobrokhotov would later tell the BBC.\n\"It will be either Russian journalists and human rights watchers, or Vladimir Putin and his killers.\"\nWatching events in Berlin unfold from the UK was the final member of the Telegram group, another Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, 47.\nAn associate recalls Orlin Roussev as a man fascinated by espionage. An email address associated with him includes the 007 sobriquet of the world's most famous secret agent.\nHe moved to Britain in 2009, before he set up a company involved in signals intelligence \u2013 the interception of communications or electronic signals.\nWhen police officers searched the faded 33-room Great Yarmouth former guest house in which he lived with his wife and stepson, they discovered, in the assessment of one expert, \"a vast amount of technical surveillance equipment which could be used to enable intrusive surveillance\".\nThey might have been less dry. It was an Aladdin's cave disguised as a cluttered seaside relic; sophisticated communications interception devices worth \u00a3175,000; radio frequency jammers; covert cameras hidden in smoke detectors, a pen, sunglasses, even men's ties; a horde of fake identity documents and equipment to make more. An encrypted hard drive was left open. Telegram conversations were visible on Roussev's laptop.\nAmong the masses of equipment, police discovered the business card of a one-time finance executive, Jan Marsalek.\nRoussev first met Jan Marsalek in 2015, introduced, he recalled, by a mutual acquaintance he had met at the offices of a British investor and wealth adviser. In emails from that time seen by the BBC, Marsalek enlists Roussev's help in acquiring a secure mobile phone from a Chinese company.\nThen, Jan Marsalek was the respected chief operating officer of German payments processing company Wirecard. While reports criticising Wirecard's business practices had started to appear in the Financial Times,  the company's reputation as a star performer in the European fintech sector, valued in excess of \u00a320 billion at its peak, was intact.\nNow, he was directing operations as Roussev's controller on the run from fraud charges - the subject of an Interpol red notice - following the company's 2020 collapse.\nTogether, the pair conceived operations targeting journalists, dissidents, politicians, even Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military installation in Stuttgart. They discussed selling US drones captured from Ukrainian battlefields to China. And they did it for Russia.\nLinked to the state's intelligence services, Marsalek is believed to be hiding in Moscow. He faces no charges in the UK.\nThe group Roussev employed, all Bulgarians, were not the spies of popular imagination.\nAlongside Dzhambazov, a medical courier, and Ivanova, a laboratory assistant, he employed a beautician with a salon in Acton, Vanya Gaberova; a painter and decorator, Tihomir Ivanchev; plus an MMA fighter nicknamed \"The Destroyer\" who wore his fights on his face, Ivan Stoyanov.\nA neighbour who knew two of the accused was sceptical they could be guilty. They were too stupid and didn't know anything, the neighbour asserted, though they admired the fighter's \"enormous calves\".\nBut they were not ineffective \u2013 Roman Dobrokhotov recognised none of the group's faces when pictures were shown to him by police.\nThe group operated a clear hierarchy. Roussev reported to Marsalek, who reported to his \"friends in Russia\". Roussev managed the rest of the Bulgarians, who he referred to as his \"minions\", Dzhambazov chief among them.\n\"There are no bosses here,\" Dzambhazov wrote, as he issued instructions to Ivanchev.\nNonetheless, \"minion\" was attached to the decorator's number in Dzhambazov's phone.\nThe group dynamics were complicated. Dzhambazov and Ivanova were in a long term relationship and lived together. Gaberova and Ivanchev were in a relationship until 2022.\nBut it was Dzhambazov and Gaberova police found in bed together when they burst into the beautician's northwest London flat in February 2023.\nBetween August 2020 and February 2023, Marsalek and Roussev exchanged 78,747 messages on the Telegram messaging app.\nThey reveal at least six operations the spy cell was tasked with over a period of years \u2013 four of which targeted individuals who were enemies of Putin's regime.\nAs well as Dobrokhotov, the investigative journalist Christo Grozev was watched at home in Vienna. Cameras in the window of a rented apartment nearby were trained on his front door.\nHe was tailed on flights and photographed in a Valencia hotel eating breakfast with co-founder of the Bellingcat investigative collective Elliott Higgins.\nA thorn in the side of Russian intelligence services, he was observed in Bulgaria meeting with an arms trader who had been the victim of an assassination attempt Grozev linked to the Russian state.\nGaberova was instructed to befriend him.\nIn Montenegro, the cell searched for Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until he fell foul of the Kremlin. They were anxious to impress. A second Russian intelligence team circled, including a chain-smoking blonde woman referred to only as \"Red Sparrow\".\nMarsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kachur. It wasn't an empty threat \u2013 a colleague of Kachur's had separately been taken to Moscow.\nA former Kazakh politician living with refugee status in London, Bergey Ryskaliyev, was targeted at a luxury apartment in Hyde Park. Further reconnaissance took place at his home.\nIvan Stoyanov, who acknowledged his part in the conspiracy, was spotted parked in a Toyota Prius outside his address. Suspicious, an assistant of Mr Ryskaliyev noted the licence plate.\nWhen confronted, the MMA fighter claimed he was working for a Kensington hospital, delivering tests. The next day, an NHS logo had been placed in the windscreen.\nProsecutors said providing information on a political dissident like Ryskaliyev \"is predicated on Russian attempts to control diplomatic relations\".\nIndeed, Marsalek would further task Roussev with another project: a hare-brained scheme to initiate a staged protest at the Kazakh Embassy featuring blood dropped from drones, an astroturf human rights campaign involving Just Stop Oil, a letter addressed to the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, advertising on London buses and unrealised deepfake pornographic video of the Kazakh president's son. Russia would then help nervous Kazakh security services \"uncover\" the \"activists\" responsible.\nIn February 2022, Telegram exchanges between Marsalek and Roussev reveal a preoccupation with following Christo Grozev to Kyiv, where he was believed to have travelled.\nTheir offers to help were rebuffed.\nFewer than three weeks later, Russian tanks surged across Ukraine's eastern, southern and northern borders.\nLater that year, Marsalek asked Roussev if one of the cell's three IMSI grabbers \u2013 sophisticated communications interception equipment \u2013 could be deployed to spy on Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. Roussev promised to retrieve it from his \"Indiana Jones garage\", where it was \"gathering dust\".\nMarsalek returned to the idea repeatedly.\nBy February 2023, Roussev and Marsalek were plotting to send Dzhambazov and \"one more person\" to Stuttgart, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers to be training on Patriot missile systems.\nHad they successfully deployed and captured Ukrainian troops' mobile phone data as planned, they might have used it to pinpoint those same troops on the battlefield \u2013 leading Russian forces to Western-supplied Ukrainian air defences.\n\"This was espionage activity of the highest level of seriousness,\" prosecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey.\nBefore their plans could be put into action, they were arrested \u2013 Dzhambazov, Ivanova, Gaberova and Stoyanov in London, Roussev in his guest house.\nThough Ivanchev identified himself to police outside Gaberova's flat, he would not be arrested for another year.\nIn his first police interview, he told officers he had spoken to MI5 in the interim. The interview was paused.\nNone of the six denied their actions.\nRoussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov pleaded guilty before trial. Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev denied knowing they were working for Russia.\nThe jury disagreed.\nIvanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev were found guilty after the jury deliberated for over 32 hours. Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing multiple false identity documents.\nThey could face up to 14 years in prison. They will be sentenced in May.\nBut it is not the end.\n\"If there is no regime change, there will be new and new teams of people who come to kill or kidnap you,\" Roman Dobrokhotov told the BBC.\n\"This is this actually something that motivates us to work.\n\"From the very beginning, I was sure it was something directly controlled by Vladimir Putin.\n\"In his dictatorship you would never take responsibility on your own to do such political stuff. \n\"You'd always have a direct order from the president.\n\"Putin is a psychopath who has no borders,\" he said.\nMessage extracts have been edited for brevity.",

He faces no charges in the UK.The group Roussev employed, all Bulgarians, were not the spies of popular imagination.Alongside Dzhambazov, a medical courier, and Ivanova, a laboratory assistant, he employed a beautician with a salon in Acton, Vanya Gaberova; a painter and decorator, Tihomir Ivanchev; plus an MMA fighter nicknamed \"The Destroyer\" who wore his fights on his face, Ivan Stoyanov.Metropolitan Police handout and social mediaClockwise from top left: Orlin Roussev, Katrin Ivanova, Ivan Stoyanov, Biser Dzhambazov, Vanya Gaberova and Tihomir IvanchevA neighbour who knew two of the accused was sceptical they could be guilty. \"This was espionage activity of the highest level of seriousness,\" prosecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey.Before their plans could be put into action, they were arrested \u2013 Dzhambazov, Ivanova, Gaberova and Stoyanov in London, Roussev in his guest house.Orlin Roussev was arrested in Great Yarmouth on 8 February 2023Though Ivanchev identified himself to police outside Gaberova's flat, he would not be arrested for another year.In his first police interview, he told officers he had spoken to MI5 in the interim.

        "article_text": "Men's Six Nations: Ireland v France\nVenue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday, 8 March Kick-off: 14:15 GMT\nCoverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1\nPeruse Ireland and France's line-ups for Saturday's potential Six Nations title decider and you'll find no shortage of instantly compelling head-to-head battles. \nCaelan Doris v Gregory Alldritt pits two of the world's best number eights against one another, Andrew Porter v Uini Atonio will be an engrossing scrum-time tussle, while powerhouse Irish centre Bundee Aki will meet his match in Yoram Moefana. \nBut naturally, most eyes are drawn to the battle of the scrum-halves. \nIn Antoine Dupont, France have a generational talent. A world player of the year in both the 15s and sevens codes, an Olympic gold medallist and a poster boy for his sport, Dupont has gleefully exhausted superlatives in recent years. \nHis otherworldly gifts even moved his Toulouse team-mates to refer to him as 'the Martian', Emmanuel Meafou revealed last year.\nDupont's worthy adversary on Saturday is Jamison Gibson-Park. 'Jamo' to his team-mates, he is Ireland's unflappable metronome and the frontrunner to wear nine for the British and Irish Lions in Australia this summer.\n\"Yeah, it will be interesting,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"Two fabulous players at the peak of their game. There are a number of individual battles across the teams, but that one will be pretty special.\"\nThis will not be the first time Gibson-Park and Dupont have crossed paths, of course. They have twice met in the Champions Cup, including last year's final when Dupont's Toulouse beat Gibson-Park's Leinster in extra time.  \nThey have met three times in the Six Nations, although not since 2022 (Gibson-Park was injured in 2023 while Dupont skipped last year's championship). \nThis time, the stakes are suitably sky-high.\nSix Nations: Ireland v France preview, coverage & stats\nDupont plays down Henry visit before Ireland game\nWinning 50th cap 'an incredible honour' - Bealham\nThis video can not be played\nIs Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?\nThis is a hugely important game for 28-year-old Dupont and France. For a player regarded by some as the greatest of all time, a single Six Nations title - in 2022 - is an underwhelming return. \nHe does not lack emotional ammunition heading to Dublin. In 2023, not even his herculean try-saving tackle on Mack Hansen could stop Ireland's charge to the Grand Slam. \nLater that year, France's home World Cup campaign ended in the quarter-finals. With his Olympic debut on the horizon, Dupont sat out last year's Six Nations as Les Bleus again finished second to the Irish. He led Toulouse to the Champions Cup in May, but craves more silverware at Test level.\nConsidering his Top 14 commitments are likely to rule him out of facing the All Blacks in the summer, the next couple of weeks takes on even greater significance as he leads France's bid to shift the Six Nations balance of power back to Paris. \nReassuringly for France head coach Fabien Galthie, Dupont has shone since his sevens sojourn. \nIn his first game back for Toulouse, in October, he scored a 13-minute hat-trick against Clermont. On his Test return, he captained his country to an unbeaten autumn campaign, which included a 30-29 win over New Zealand. \nFresh from scoring four tries in as many Champions Cup pool games for Toulouse, he sparkled on his Six Nations return.\nDupont's assist for Theo Attissogbe's try launched a 43-0 rout over Wales, his dead-eyed cross-kick encapsulating the decision-making and accuracy that helps set him apart.\nHe did, however, endure a rare off-night in the defeat by England. He was well shackled by the home side's defence and was not immune to the handling errors that derailed the French cause, dropping a Thomas Ramos pass when an opening try seemed a certainty.\nBut as the greats often do, he bounced back, masterfully orchestrating a French attack that scored 11 tries against Italy in Rome. \nHe even bagged himself a couple, his first Six Nations tries since the Grand Slam-clinching win over England in 2022. \nFrance missed Dupont last year, but he has been at the centre of this year's title bid, his eight direct try involvements (two tries, six assists) bettered only by his team-mate Louis Bielle-Biarrey (four tries, five assists). \nSignificantly, Romain Ntamack returns from suspension to partner Toulouse team-mate Dupont at half-back in Dublin. They started all five games of France's 2022 Grand Slam triumph together, but only one since the 2023 World Cup because of Ntamack's injuries and Dupont's sevens commitments.\nWhile Dupont is a global superstar, Gibson-Park prefers to stay away from the spotlight. Unfortunately for him, he is too good to remain in the background.  \nIt hasn't always been this way.\nAfter giving up on representing New Zealand, Gibson-Park moved to Leinster from the Hurricanes in 2016. He qualified for Ireland under the residency rule in 2019 but was left out of Joe Schmidt's World Cup squad. \nHe had to bide his time at Leinster, too, behind Luke McGrath, who started the 2018 and 2019 Champions Cup finals.\nIreland coach Andy Farrell, however, recognised his potential, handing him his Test debut in October 2020. \nHe shone in the autumn wins over Japan and New Zealand a year later, broke up Ireland's iconic Johnny Sexton-Conor Murray partnership and has not looked back, rarely being overlooked when fit.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT\nHaving missed last summer's Test series in South Africa through injury, Gibson-Park has elevated his game. In November's defeat by New Zealand, he was one of a select few in green who showed up, and was key in the victories over Argentina and Australia.\nHe has been even better in the Six Nations, delivering a series of game-changing moments for Ireland in recent weeks. \nIn his player-of-the-match display against England, he scored a crucial try to jolt Ireland out of a sluggish start, brilliantly side-stepping Freddie Steward after James Lowe had shrugged off Alex Mitchell. \nHe was arguably even better as Ireland powered past Scotland in Murrayfield. \nHis superb, try-saving tackle on Blair Kinghorn - after sprinting more than half the length of the field - demonstrated his defensive awareness, speed and ability to read the play as he stopped the hosts cutting Ireland's lead to two points.\nIn Cardiff - where he again won player of the match - he showed how his kicking helps Ireland open teams up. With Ireland trailing Wales 18-13 in the second half, it was his pinpoint cross-kick that allowed Lowe to palm the ball into Jamie Osborne's path for a crucial try.\nAlongside Lowe and Sam Prendergast, Gibson-Park has been at the forefront of Ireland's ramped-up kicking game this year. He recently said he \"couldn't kick snow off a rope\" when he arrived at Leinster in 2016, so he has turned weakness into strength.\nDupont came out on top when he last faced Gibson-Park in the 2024 Investec Champions Cup final \nGibson-Park is softly spoken in front of the media but his leadership should not be overlooked, either. \nAfter Sexton's retirement, he has helped guide untested fly-halves Jack Crowley and Prendergast through their debut Six Nations campaigns.  \nTo win in Dublin and take control of the championship, both sides need every facet operating with optimum efficiency. \nBut much will hinge on how the nines fare. Considering what they have produced in recent weeks, they are poised to take centre stage on Saturday. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "A new Bollywood film - Mrs - has once again laid bare a stark reality: even in well-educated households in India a woman's role is often confined to unpaid domestic work.\nThe protagonist, married to a gynaecologist, finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning and caregiving. Her dreams are sidelined not by force, but by relentless criticism and quiet coercion.\nWhile the film, which is a remake of the hit Malayalam movie The Great Indian Kitchen, has sparked conversation - and pushback, especially from men on social media - its themes resonate with hard data.\nA recent government survey reveals that Indian women spend over seven hours a day on unpaid domestic and caregiving work - more than twice the time men do. Data shows that women spend 289 minutes on unpaid domestic work and 137 minutes on unpaid caregiving, whereas men spend 88 minutes on chores and 75 minutes on care work.\nThey also spent less time than men doing paid work and engaging in self-care activities.\nWhat's disappointing is that the last such survey which came out six years ago had similar results. Despite the government launching campaigns to empower women,  the situation hasn't changed much.\nIndia's Time Use Surveys (TUS) track how people spend their time across various activities. Surveyors gather data nationwide by asking individuals aged six to 59 how they spent the previous day. The first TUS was released in 2019, with the second published last week.\nWhen the government released findings from the second Time Use Survey (TUS), it highlighted two key shifts: women aged 15 to 59 spent 10 minutes less on unpaid domestic work, while their participation in employment and related activities rose by just over three percentage points.\nThe survey concluded this marked a \"shift from unpaid to paid activities\" for women - a positive sign that they were spending less time on domestic chores and more time in paid employment.\nHowever, economists argue this isn't necessarily true. Even if it is, the slight drop in domestic work suggests women are still juggling paid jobs with a heavier load of unpaid work than men.\nAshwini Deshpande, an economics professor at Ashoka University, says TUS data should be analysed alongside India's Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) for a deeper understanding of how women spend their time. FLFPR measures the percentage of women aged 15 and above in the labour force.\nAccording to government data, the FLFPR grew from about 23% in 2017-2018 to 37% in 2022-2023. Prof Deshpande says that this increase is not solely due to an increase in employment opportunities for women, but has also been spurred by economic distress.\n\"Women are not waiting for their time spent on domestic chores to reduce to take up jobs. Research shows that women want to work to supplement household incomes and so they end up working 'double-shifts', doing paid work outside the home and unpaid work inside,\" Prof Deshpande says.\nIndian women aren't alone in shouldering a disproportionate share of household and caregiving work -  it's a global reality. However, the gap in time spent on domestic work is significantly wider in India.\nWhere globally women spend about 2.8 hours more than men on domestic and care work, for Indian women, this difference is closer to four hours.\nSociologists attribute this to India's deeply patriarchal society, which continues to enforce strict gender norms. Even among the educated elite, women remain confined by roles upheld and perpetuated not just by men, but also by women.\nThis rigid enforcement of gender roles doesn't just shape women's lives - it also shapes the way stories about them are received.\nSo, while Mrs struck a chord with many, it also faced sharp criticism - especially from men on social media.\nA men's rights group accused it of \"spreading toxicity\" against traditional joint families, while others dismissed its premise altogether.\nKajol Srinivasan, a Mumbai-based comedian, says the film ruffled feathers because it held up an uncomfortable mirror to society.\nShe told the BBC how her father, who quit his job at 40 to take over household duties while her mother continued working, quickly realised that housework was no easy task.\n\"The first week he was excited; he cooked different dishes and deep-cleaned the house,\" she says. \nBut then he began to find the work tedious and couldn't continue beyond a week.  \n\"My father realised that housework was not just about work, it was also an imbalance in power. The power always stays with the breadwinner; no matter how well you cook, there are no accolades,\" she says.\nShe believes that women are expected and raised to accept this lower rung of power. \n\"When Indian men talk about what they like about their wives and mothers, it often has a lot to do with how much they have sacrificed for them or how much they take care of them or the home,\" Ms Srinivasan says.\nIndia's Time Use Survey shows that social change is slow, and it may take time before women spend less on domestic work.\nIn the meantime, films like Mrs spark conversations around everyday questions many prefer to avoid - like, who's doing the dishes?

        "article_text": "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.\nHe teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.\nThen, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.\nThe 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh. \nBut he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.\nMany criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.\nSeven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.\nA lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.\nSingh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".\nHe claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.\n\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.\nBut Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.\nInstead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.\nSince his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"\nIn interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth\n\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"\nBorn Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.\n\"This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,\" he's often heard saying.\nSingh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says. \nBut after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"\nSo he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.\nFor three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.\nBrown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.\nDespite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.\n\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.\nBut Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.\n\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.\nIn 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"\nSingh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.\n\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"\nFans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.\n\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student. \nOthers see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.\nNo matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.\n\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently. \n\"I am back and I want the same love I received seven years ago.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",
