Nor have far-left groups till now made prisoners' rights a particular issue.\nInvestigators have said that perpetrators of the attacks caught on video were dressed more like drugs-gang foot soldiers rather than far-left militants, who tend to come from a different social background.\nAnd in one location they wrote the wrong set of initials \u2013 DDFM \u2013 suggesting that their attachment to the supposed organisation was not exactly deep.\nThe theory of foreign manipulation is taken seriously \u2013 especially after proven cases of Russian interference such as the spraying of Stars of David in Paris after the October 7 attacks.\nRelations with Algeria are also at an all-time low at the moment.\nBut if the drugs gang theory is the favoured one, it is because means and motivation are both so easy to grasp.\nThe French government currently includes an unusual tandem: an interior and a justice minister who are not rivals; who are both on the political right; and who have pledged to fight head-on the scourge that they say is the drugs trade.\nTo this end Darmanin and Retailleau are currently steering a bill through parliament that they say will seriously hamper the drugs lords' ability to operate.\nA dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office will be created. There will be extra powers for investigators, and a special, protected status for informers.\nEven more of a threat to the drugs barons \u2013 so the government says \u2013 will be two newly converted prisons, where the 100 most powerful of them will be interned from later this year.\nIn these top-security jails, there will be much stricter rules governing visits and communication with the outside world.

        "article_text": "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry! \nLady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.\nBetter yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).\nWith that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.\nLady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.\nHer second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.\nStaged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's  inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.\nDuring Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.\nIt was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off. \nIf you only watch one performance, make it this one.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).\nDespite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year. \nLuckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.\nShe arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.\nThe only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time).\n\n\"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".\nThe British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.\nWith her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.\nWatch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).\nAlthough Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.\nThey plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".\nThat aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"\nIt might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.\nHe rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.\nIt all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).\nSurprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two. \nAs someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).\nIn 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.\nLisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.\nAfter her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Ros\u00e9 (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).\nJennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.\nHighlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break -  and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.\nThe 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers. \nWatch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).\nCharli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.\nPerforming entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.\nCompared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.\nAt several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".\nWhether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen. But Charli is worth your time either way.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 7:15pm on Saturday (local time), or 3:15am on Sunday (UK time).\nAnyone who's had the pleasure of watching Benson Boone over the last year will know he's fond of performing a front flip off his piano, the big show off.\nHe didn't let us down at Coachella - bouncing around the stage like a Duracell Bunny attached to a car battery. To cap it all off, he brought out Brian May for a surprisingly successful version of Bohemian Rhapsody.\nLess fortunate, however, was Texan singer d4vd, whose attempt at a backflip went disastrously wrong.\nThankfully, he recovered in time to pull off an energetic set that highlighted the life-affirming vibes of his bedroom pop hits Feel It and What Are You Waiting For.\nAfter the set, he swore to practice harder for this weekend's performance. \"Imagine if I fall again,\" he cringed.\nWatch Benson Boone on the Coachella Stage at 7:05pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45 am on Saturday (UK Time). D4vd plays the Gobi Stage at 5:55pm on Friday (local time), or 1:55am on Saturday (UK time).\nLast Saturday, the entire LA Philharmonic Orchestra boarded a bus and set off for the desert to make their Coachella debut.\nUnder the baton of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, they performed what was billed as \"Gustavo's mixtape\" - moving seamlessly between classical standards like Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and modern pop hits.\nFor the latter, they were joined on stage by a host of A-list stars, including indie titan Beck, Icelandic songstress Laufey, country singer Maren Morris and rap icon LL Cool J.\n\"I told to the orchestra, 'I'm so happy conducting, but I wish I could be in the middle of the crowd and enjoy the moment,'\" Dudamel told Variety magazine ahead of the show.\nWeekend two will feature an all-new array of guest stars, he promised, but details are being kept under wraps for now. \nThe LA Philharmonic plays the Outdoor Theatre at 6:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 2:25am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"It took me 20 years to get on this stage,\" said T-Pain towards the end of his set on Saturday, and he certainly made the most of his hour-long set.\nHe covered Journey's Don't Stop Believin' and Chris Stapleton's country hit Tennessee Whiskey, while racing through early 2000s hits like Buy U A Drank and I'm In Luv, and revisiting his verses on Flo Rida's Low, and Kanye West's Good Life.\nFor that, he received a hero's welcome, with the crowd treating his set as an excuse for some turn of the millennium escapism. \nBy the time it ended, a campaign had started for T-Pain to play next year's Super Bowl half-time show.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 5:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 1:25am on Sunday (UK time).\nLuckily, you're not forced to stay up all night to watch the stars strut their stuff in California.\nCoachella's generous livestreams repeat throughout the day, and you can rewind several hours to find the performances you want.\nOther highlights from the first weekend included Megan Thee Stallion, whose star-studded set included appearances from Queen Latifah, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, and Ciara; and Kraftwerk, reminding everyone that they essentially invented electronic music.\nBelinda Carlisle reunited with her old band The Go-Gos for a dose of sun-kissed 1980s nostalgia, and the UK's Sam Fender tore through a blistering set that showcased the songwriting chops of his new album, People Watching.\nAmong the newcomers with main stage aspirations were South Africa's hip-swivelling R&B star Tyla, and New York dance act Fcukers, whose breakout hit Bon Bon was one of the weekend's most inescapable tracks.\nYou can see the full line-up for Coachella's second weekend on the festival's website.",

But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.With her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.Watch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).4) Green Day are 'not part of the MAGA agenda'Getty ImagesGreen Day headlined the main stage in what was their first ever appearance at CoachellaAlthough Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.They plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".That aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).5) Post Malone's good-time hoedownGetty ImagesPost Malone closed the festival on Sunday night, with a characteristically unpretentious set\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump has attacked the head of the US central bank for not cutting interest rates, stating that Jerome Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough!\".\nThe US president took to social media to renew his criticism of Powell ahead of the third interest rate cut this year by European Central Bank (ECB).\nOn Thursday, it announced that it had reduced the key rate \"owing to rising trade tensions\".\nTrump, who nominated Powell as Federal Reserve chair in 2017 during his first term, wrote that he \"is always TOO LATE AND WRONG\" on reducing borrowing costs.\nTrump continued:  \"Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now.\"\nWhile oil prices have fallen since the start of the month when Trump unveiled his tariff regime, eggs prices have risen to $6.23 per dozen, according to official data. \nMeanwhile, the BBC has found no evidence for Trump's claims about how much money the US is collecting from tariffs.\nAs Trump attacked Powell, Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB defended her American counterpart. \n\"I have a lot of respect for my friend and esteemed colleague Jay Powell,\" said Lagarde as she discussed the decision to cut European interest rates from 2.5% to 2.25%. \n\"We have a solid, steady relationship amongst central bankers.\"\nThe president lashed out after Powell said on Wednesday that US economic growth will be hit and prices will rise for consumers as a result of Trump's tariffs.\nHe said the import taxes were larger than the bank had expected, going beyond the higher end of its estimates.\nThere has been turmoil on global stock markets as investors reacted to the tariffs and an escalating trade war between the US and China.\nMr Powell said: \"The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated. \n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"\nThe US president has said tariffs will boost US manufacturing and jobs but economists have warned they risk fuelling inflation. Trump campaigned on cutting inflation. \nIt is not the first time that Trump has targeted Powell, who he nominated to replace Janet Yellen who the president accused of keeping interest rates too low.\nThe president's campaign promises included calls for lower interest rates in order to bring relief to borrowers.\nSince returning to office, Trump has stoked a trade war by introducing a 10% tax on goods being imported to the US from the vast majority of countries.\nHe has escalated tariffs further with China by putting a 145% tax on Chinese goods, though there are some exemptions for smartphones. China has hit back with tariffs of 125% on US products. The White House said on Wednesday that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nMr Powell said that despite the uncertainty and ructions in the markets, the \"US economy is still in a solid position\".\nFor now, he said, the Fed could keep its benchmark interest rate steady \"to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments\".\nThe Fed's benchmark interest rate is currently set in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%, where it has been since December following a series of rate cuts late last year.\nIf tariffs push up inflation, as many economists expect, the Fed could decide to hold or even raise rates. Traders on Wednesday kept their bets it will continue to cut rates this year.\nBut the Fed also has a mandate to maintain maximum employment as well as stable prices.\nShould it be caught between rising inflation and a rising unemployment rate, Mr Powell said \"we would consider how far the economy is from each goal\" and then look at \"the potentially different time horizons\" for getting prices under control and bringing the unemployment rate down.\n\"As that great Chicagoan Ferris Bueller once noted, \"life moves pretty fast\", he added.",

        "article_text": "Harry Maguire joined Manchester United from Leicester City in 2019\nManchester United defender Harry Maguire says their 5-4 win against Lyon was the \"strangest game\" he has ever played in. \nThe England centre-back scored the second of two goals in the 120th minute of extra time to send United through to the semi-finals of the Europa League with a 7-6 aggregate victory.\nLyon, who had been 2-0 down on the night, scored four times without reply and had Corentin Tolisso sent off, before conceding three times in seven extra-time minutes. \nThe fixture was the first in European history in which five goals were scored in extra time, while United became the first club to score twice in the 120th minute of a European tie. \nMaguire, who was named United captain in 2020 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but was stripped of the armband under Erik ten Hag in 2023, said the victory was one of his career highlights. \n\"It was an incredible feeling to score that winner in such an important game, in a game that was full of emotion and the strangest, maddest game I've ever played in or witnessed,\" said Maguire. \n\"I've been here six years now and I've had some great times and some bad times as well.\n\"I think that game pretty much summed up my time at this club, to be honest.\n\"I don't know how I would have felt if I had come here and been speaking to you after a 4-2 defeat - it's not even worth trying to think about that.\"\nGreatest European comebacks as Man Utd beat Lyon\n'Three games from glory, Man Utd begin to show never-say-die DNA'\nMaguire scores last-minute winner as Man Utd beat Lyon in nine-goal classic\nUnited had been cruising in the first half, taking a 2-0 lead into half-time after goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot.\nBut Tolisso's header halved the deficit 19 minutes from time, before Nicolas Tagliafico equalised six minutes later. \nDespite being reduced to 10 men, Lyon took the lead on aggregate through Rayan Cherki in extra time before former Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette scored a fourth from the penalty spot.\nLyon's players celebrated Lacazette's effort 11 minutes from time by running towards the away end, at the other end of the pitch to where the penalty was taken. \n\"I think they [Lyon] thought they'd won it, the way they were celebrating,\" said Maguire.\n\"That gave us more of an incentive to turn the game around. \n\"I think the worst feeling was that we felt we'd thrown it away, rather than lost the game at that moment, and how we managed to get ourselves into that situation, because even going into extra time at 2-2, the momentum was back with us with the sending off, we shouldn't end up in that situation.\n\"We've got to do far better than that if we want to win this competition - we can't be doing that and be leaving it to turn it around in that situation.\"\nUnited boss Ruben Amorim says he will trust the \"kids\" to guide the club through the remainder of the Premier League season in order to rest some of his senior players for Europe. \nUnited will face Spanish side Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals, after their 2-0 aggregate win against Rangers. \nThe competition is now United's main focus, despite having six matches to play in the remainder of a Premier League campaign which sees the 20-time champions of England floundering in 14th.\nThe United boss noted Portuguese duo Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot were both suffering from fatigue as Thursday's epic encounter drew to a close.\nIt means 17-year-old striker Chido Obi, who is not registered to play in Europe, is likely to play some part against Wolves at Old Trafford on Sunday.\nThe same is also true of full-back Harry Amass, who came on for Patrick Dorgu for the final 20 minutes against Lyon, defenders Jaydan Kamason and Godwill Kukonki and midfielder Jack Moorhouse, who were all on the bench.\nStriker Gabriel Biancheri has been on the fringes of the first team, as have Darren Fletcher's twin sons Jack and Tyler Fletcher.\nIf former Arsenal defender Ayden Heaven has recovered from the setback he suffered as he closed on full fitness after a recent ankle injury, he will be involved too given how much the 18-year-old impressed in his four first-team outings before last month's international break.\n\"It is not the best moment or the best season to put kids in because they need a strong base to really show what they can do,\" said Amorim.\n\"But in this moment you need to do it and sometimes you have some surprises.\n\"I can be honest, Ayden [Heaven] just played because we had a lot of injuries in that moment. But today I think of him as my player. When he is ready he is facing the competition in the team because he is ready to play.\n\"You don't know. Amass did really well today. Chido when he played, did quite well. It is a difficult moment and not the right moment for the kids to play. But if we have to do it, we will.\"\nIt is not known yet whether senior defenders Noussair Mazraoui or Victor Lindelof will be involved against Wolves.\nMazraoui was taken off at half-time and Lindelof had a planned substitute appearance scrapped after they were alerted independently to medical issues at home.\n\"It was the same for both,\" he said. \n\"Sometimes you don't control these things but everything is OK now. I know football is really important but there are things that are more important. They will be ready to play the next game.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "summary": "'Not the time to discuss future' - Alonso on Real Madrid linksImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Xabi Alonso won 14 trophies during his club career, plus the World Cup and two European Championships with SpainTom MallowsBBC Sport journalistPublished18 April 2025, 15:29 BSTUpdated 3 hours agoXabi Alonso says it is \"not a good time\" to discuss his future after the Bayer Leverkusen boss was linked with Real Madrid.The 43-year-old is reportedly a candidate to succeed Carlo Ancelotti should the Italian leave Real at the end of the season.Alonso is highly regarded after leading Leverkusen to the double of a Bundesliga title without losing a game and the German Cup in his first full season as a senior club manager last year. Alonso was linked with Real, Liverpool and Bayern Munich last year, but told a news conference in March he wanted to stay at Leverkusen following talks with the club's hierarchy.The former Liverpool and Spain midfielder won La Liga and the Champions League during a six-season spell as a Madrid player between 2009 and 2014.Alonso retired as a player following a three-year spell at Bayern Munich in 2017.He moved into coaching with Real Madrid's Under-14 side the following year, before three years in charge of Real Sociedad's B team.In October 2022, Leverkusen gave him his first managerial role in first-team football and, having taken over with the club second from bottom in the Bundesliga, led them to a sixth-placed finish.Last season he guided Leverkusen to their first Bundesliga title and the German Cup in impressive fashion. We're at a very important moment in the season,\" said Alonso, whose Leverkusen side are six points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich with five games left. \"Leverkusen chief executive Fernando Carro said last week that Alonso was \"comfortable\" at the club and already planning for next season.Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has also been linked with Real in the past week amid speculation over Ancelotti's future.But when asked about Real's potential interest, Klopp's agent Marc Kosicke told Sky Germany, external on Friday that \"Jurgen is very happy with his new role as head of global soccer at Red Bull\".Klopp stepped down as Liverpool manager at the end of last season after just over eight-and-a-half years in charge at Anfield.The German took up a position at Red Bull in October 2024 when he reiterated he did not envisage himself \"on the sidelines anymore\". \"It's not a good time to discuss the future.",

        "article_text": "Michele Kang has been labelled the first tycoon in women's football\nSuccess is synonymous with Olympique Lyonnais Feminin.\nSince being established in 2004, the French club have become one of the superpowers in women's football, lifting 38 trophies across the domestic and European stage.\nTheir record in the Women's Champions League is unparalleled, winning the competition eight times in an 11-year period between 2011 and 2022.\nWhile Lyon remain a formidable force in the women's game, with a record-extending 12th European final appearance on the horizon if they overcome Arsenal over the next fortnight, other teams are catching up in terms of both investment and on-field success. \nIn recent years they have been usurped on the European stage by fellow semi-finalists Barcelona, who are just three matches from a third Champions League title in a row.\nAfter nearly two decades as the passion project of former Lyon owner Jean-Michel Aulas, the club have turned to trailblazing American businesswoman Michele Kang to give them a new lease of life. BBC World Service's World Football podcast has taken a closer look at the club's unique journey.\nOlympique Lyonnais: The Champions League trailblazers\nThe women's football investors 'ripping up blueprint' on club ownership\nIs this the future of the Women's Championship?\nAulas established OL Feminin in 2004\nFor more than 30 years, local businessman Aulas was Lyon.\nAfter becoming owner and president in 1987, following pleas from the city's mayor and F1 legend Alain Prost, he oversaw the men's club's transformation from a debt-ridden club languishing in the second tier to serial trophy-winners throughout the 2000s.\nDetermined to replicate that success in women's football, he launched OL Feminin in 2004 and, under his ownership, the club attracted top overseas players, championed French talent like Wendie Renard, and opened France's first mixed-gender academy.\nIt took three years to deliver silverware, winning the Premiere Ligue in 2006-07. The rest is history.\n\"This guy was ahead of his time,\" former Lyon defender Lucy Bronze told the BBC's World Service. \"To have someone that powerful say I want the women's team to do well, I want them to be the best, I want to give them everything.\n\"He was the first one [to invest in women's football], not just with his money but with physically being there and how much he cared about the team. He enjoyed it just as much as the girls. He celebrated just as hard as we did.\"\nBronze is one of a number of superstars in the women's game to have played for Lyon\nAulas' ownership ended in 2022 when Eagle Football became the majority shareholders of the OL Groupe, which encompassed both the men's and women's teams - as well as a majority stake in NWSL side Seattle Reign, and he resigned from his 36-year presidency the following year.\nIn 2023, the women's team changed hands again, with South Korea-born American businesswoman Kang, who made her fortune in healthcare IT, taking on majority ownership and making it a separate entity - \"independent\" - from the men's team.\n\"We have reached the end of our model a bit,\" chief executive Vincent Ponsot said. \"I think we needed a new lease of life, a new project. That is exactly what Michele brought with a much more global vision.\n\"We now see clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Barcelona. There is competition and our ambition is to remain one of the best European clubs. If Michele had not arrived, I think it would have been almost impossible because we need France to move much faster than it does today.\"\nKang also owns Washington Spirit and London City Lionesses\nDescribed by the Financial Times as \"arguably the first tycoon in women's football\", Kang is a relative latecomer to football.\nShe first became interested in the sport after meeting the World Cup-winning US women's team in 2019 and has since built up a portfolio of teams under her Kynisca Sports International group. In addition to Lyon, she has been the majority owner of NWSL team Washington Spirit since 2022 and purchased Women's Championship side London City Lionesses in 2023.\n\"I realised these are the best of the best athletes around the world,\" Kang said, reflecting on her meeting with the USWNT.\n\"I saw a significant lack of resources and attention. I saw the possibility of how women's football could explode with a little nudge and a little investment. \n\"I am not alone and there are a lot of people who share the same passion. Two billion people watch the World Cup - it's growing.\"\nKang's interest isn't limited to multi-club ownership, however, with a number of multi-million pound investments in women's sport, including a \u00a339m global investment in improving the health of elite female athletes.\nHer plans for Lyon are no less grand. Her long-term ambitions include the construction of a dedicated women's centre, with a 15-18,000-seater stadium and a bigger training facility, while she has already invested heavily in improving the club's backroom staff.\n\"The first thing she said to me was 'Vincent, what do you have to do for the OL women's team to have the same supervisions as the professional men's team?'. That was in August 2023,\" Ponsot said.\n\"I told her, 'we have to hire 11 people to the staff', and she said, 'go on then'. Two months later, we had 11 more people and 24 staff to improve the support to players so they can perform.\n\"The main thing we have evolved is in the performance sector. We have full-time nutritionists, physiotherapists, doctors, a performance manager, a psychologist. We have everything we need for the players to be in the best conditions to perform like the men's team.\"\nLyon midfielder and USA captain Lindsey Heaps added: \"[Michele] is incredible. I have never seen anything like this in the women's game, the sort of investment but also the way she speaks.\n\"When she took over she was a bit shocked that it was such a prestigious club and still [have] things that we need. Sometimes you can look at it and think 'they have Champions League trophies, they are winning every single game' [but] it's still not to the standard we need.\"\nLyon have attracted some 15,000-20,000 fans to Groupama Stadium for big Champions League games, but play most of their home matches at the 1,500-seater Gerard Houllier Stadium  \nAnother of Kang's priorities is increasing attendances at Lyon fixtures. \n\"If you ask many female players what is at the top of your wishlist, they don't say I want to get paid more, I want bigger cars. They say, 'I want to play against the best players and best teams in a sellout stadium'. It's my job that we fill the stadium,\" she said.\nLyon will travel to Emirates Stadium on Saturday (12:30 BST) for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final with Arsenal - a stadium where the Gunners recorded an average attendance of 52,029 across six matches last season.\n\"When you see that Arsenal are filling Emirates Stadium, there is no reason why we can't,\" said Ponsot. \"We realised that women's football has an audience with a strong increase in appetite, but we are having trouble making it a reality.\"\nLyon are on course for a record-extending 18th league title this season, having already booked their place in May's end-of-season play-offs. Indeed, they have only lost two league matches over the past four seasons.\nThat sustained success, coupled with Aulas' unmatched support, is seen by some as having had a negative impact on crowds, media interest, and investment in France.\nWomen's football journalist Assile Toufaily said: \"Some will say 'why should we come and watch football that isn't attractive because the level isn't that good?' We know OL are going to smash the other clubs 7-0. Fans aren't intrigued to come and watch.\n\"They say if you want to have a better level of football, investors have to invest. Investors will then say why should we invest if the media isn't promoting the game? So you find yourself in a vicious circle and it's been like this for years.\"\nBut she does not see Aulas' investment as the problem. \n\"If he didn't invest in 2004, maybe no-one would ever have done it in France. Aulas isn't to blame, but maybe the problem is others didn't follow along.\"\nKang, unsurprisingly, is undaunted by this, working with Ponsot to \"find the profile\" of women's football fans, with their own research indicating only a 5% overlap between fans who watch men's and women's matches.\nShe will likely find a powerful ally in Aulas, who was elected vice-president of the French Football Federation in December 2023 and has taken over responsibility for development of women's football. \n\"The French league is going to be very strong in years to come,\" vowed Aulas.\n\"If I acted badly before by being too strong [when I was] with Lyon, you can expect me to act badly [in my role] with France.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "A US federal judge has given President Donald Trump's officials a one-week deadline to comply with his court order or risk being found in contempt of court - potentially setting up a historic clash between two equally powerful branches of government.\nJudge James Boasberg said the \"most obvious way\" for the officials to avoid contempt was to \"assert custody\" over a group of more than 200 people who they deported to El Salvador last month - after he told them not to do so. \nBut the Trump administration has shown no sign of a desire to adhere, criticising Wednesday's request and saying it would appeal. \nThe White House denies any wrongdoing, and has depicted the group as \"terrorists and criminal illegal migrants\" who threaten American society.\nExperts have told the BBC that a showdown between the judicial and executive branch appears all but inevitable. So, what might happen if the government does not comply with Judge Boasberg's deadline of 23 April? \nThe first step to hold any Trump officials in contempt of court would be to determine who was responsible for the non-compliance, an expert told the BBC.\nAt the moment, it remains unclear who took the specific actions against Judge's Boasberg's initial order to not deport people to El Salvador, said Robert Tsai, a Boston University constitutional law professor.\nLawyers would use a process called discovery to decide who was responsible, by seeking documents and questioning government officials under oath.\n\"You want to be able to nail someone down and pinpoint who it is that's basically saying, 'We're getting the planes up in the air, and just stonewall the judge,'\" Prof Tsai said.\nGovernment lawyers have said the planes were already en route by the time Judge Boasberg's written order was issued, and that his subsequent verbal order for the planes to return happened when they were no longer in US airspace. \nIf he felt government lawyers were not playing ball, Judge Boasberg could fine both the lawyers and other government officials until they complied, Prof Tsai said. The sanctions or penalties would apply until the government met the terms of the judge's order. \nAll of this falls under the umbrella of civil contempt. \n\nThere is also the possibility of Trump administration officials being found in criminal contempt - for which the punishment could include jail time. \n\"That's considered one of the most serious things, and usually the last resort,\" Prof Tsai said. \nIn the case of criminal contempt, Prof Tsai said the normal course of events would be to refer the issue for prosecution by the justice department, which is run by Attorney General Pam Bondi. \nJudge Boasberg also has the power to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue criminal contempt charges and to sidestep Bondi, a Trump loyalist who was appointed by the president.\n\"With this administration, it is very possible that the justice department refuses to prosecute,\" George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin explained to the BBC. \nEven if the justice department does take the case, Trump has the power to pardon a criminal offence. But the president does not have the power to issue pardons for civil liability (civil contempt).\nThe ruling from US District Judge James E Boasberg on Wednesday said the government showed \"wilful disregard\" for his order when it sent planes carrying alleged criminals to El Salvador - after he had barred the government from using a wartime law for the deportations. \nThat law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, gave the Trump administration power to expedite its deportation of those it said were gang members without providing any evidence.\nThe US Supreme Court later ruled that Trump was able to use the wartime law, Judge Boasberg said on Wednesday that \"does not excuse the government's violation\" of his earlier request.\nTo avoid contempt proceedings, the judge gave the administration two options - to \"purge\" itself of contempt, or to remedy its noncompliance.\n\"The most obvious way\", he said, was for the administration to \"assert custody\" of the hundreds deported to El Salvador's mega-prison, so they could \"challenge their removability\". \nJudge Boasberg said the government would not need to release any of those deported - a number of whom have not been convicted of any crimes - nor fly them back to the US.\nThe judge said the administration could also \"propose other methods of coming into compliance\". \nThe high-stakes collision between a federal judge and the Trump administration comes under a president whose stated goal was to enact the \"largest deportation programme\" in US history. \nIf any officials are found in contempt, regardless of Trump's possible involvement, it is unlikely that the president himself would ever be criminally charged, Prof Tsai said, thanks to the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling last year.\n\"I think that the presidential immunity decision that was issued is going to be the thing that protects him from any kind of criminal prosecution,\" Prof Tsai explained. \n\"All these orders are sort of policy decisions. They might be illegal, they might be unconstitutional, who knows. \n\"But even if they are, they're done within the scope of his his core powers,\" he said.\n",

Generally, Finns are flattered \u2013 happy, even \u2013 to be honoured by the report's conclusions, but while graciously accepting them, they feel \"happiness\" isn't really the right word. Instead, \"contentment\", \"fulfilment\" or \"life satisfaction\" are widely considered more appropriate terms. As Finnish President Alexander Stubb recently posted on Facebook: \"No one can be happy all the time, and sometimes circumstance makes it difficult. But getting the basics right \u2013 security, freedom and equality \u2013 is a good start.\"\nBut while the concept of happiness in Finland may be nuanced and culturally specific, it is deeply embedded in the fabric of daily life. Rather than seeking constant highs, the Finnish approach is rooted in balance, connection and quiet contentment \u2013 qualities that increasingly resonate with visitors. And for travellers, this state of being is not just something to observe but one to get involved with first-hand, through embracing the country's nature, sauna culture, food, sustainable design and lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We see Finnish happiness as a summary of these five elements,\" says Teemu Ahola, director of international operations at Visit Finland, \"but we don't measure or collect data to evaluate happiness as a single attraction in itself\".\nTo experience these tangible, authentic aspects of Finnish life that underpin its consistent happiness ranking, Ahola suggests Finnish sauna culture as an increasingly popular, most globally identifiable attraction; and stresses that Finland is a safe country, naming the risk of bumping into free-roaming reindeer in northern Lapland as one of the few potential hazards for visiting tourists. Meanwhile, he adds, a new and confident generation of Finnish chefs has earned international respect for and interest in the Finnish culinary scene.\n2025's Happiest Countries\nThe 2025 top 10 happiest countries, in descending order, consist of Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Norway, Israel, Luxembourg and Mexico. The Report's findings are based on Gallup poll scores for inequality (or absence thereof), social support, GDP per capita, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, perceptions of corruption, positive emotions, and willingness to donate and volunteer. \"Caring and Sharing\" were chosen as general themes for the 2025 report, timely reminders of the societal virtues of empathy and community.\u00a0\nFinland is home to the world's northernmost Michelin star restaurant, Tapio, in Ruka-Kuusamo; and the Saimaa Lakeland region was named a European Region of Gastronomy in 2024. Many restaurants across Helsinki celebrate the edible riches \u2013 mushrooms, berries, fish and game \u2013 that are accessible to all in the country's endless forests, coastal archipelagos and inland waterways through Finland's Jokaisenoikeudet\u00a0or \"Everyman's Right\", a law that grants everyone the freedom to roam and forage.\nHelsinki, where most visitors start or end their trip, offers a first-hand glimpse of this national contentment. This is a seaside city, spread over a beautiful natural archipelago and reclaimed land. It's easy to grab a city bike from one of the dozens of stands around town and head off to explore the coast-hugging cycling routes or disappear into Central Park, a belt of forest that stretches from the city centre to its northern periphery.\nThe endorphin boost experienced by this kind of freewheeling adventure and access to plentiful natural resources ties directly into the UN's happiness metrics of life expectancy, freedom and positive emotions. This connection can be found at the heart of SaimaaLife, a nature and wellness company in eastern Finland's sprawling Saimaa Lakeland region, run by mental health expert and guide Mari Ahonen.\nAhonen is an enthusiastic advocate of the mental balance that Finnish nature and lifestyle have to offer and leads her guests through shinrin-yoku (forest bathing), traditional lakeside saunas, wild swimming, foraging trips for mushrooms and berries and cooking over an open fire.\n\"We Finns can be too modest,\" she says. \"We should notice the World Happiness status in a positive way. I'm a living example of having been able to develop a business with the support that has been available for my entrepreneurship. Some people say it's a lottery win to be born in Finland.\"\u00a0\nA lottery win, that is, in the form of life satisfaction and balance; of living comfortably and having \"enough\" in a material sense. This ceiling of expectation shouldn't be confused with a lack of ambition or resourcefulness. After all, this is the birthplace of mobile communications pioneer Nokia, the distinctive garden tool and scissor brand Fiskars and textile and clothing icon Marimekko.\u00a0\nFinland isn't immune from economic pressure or controversies, however, and the long, dark winters can put a strain on mental health. The Finnish idea of happiness also includes a dose of sisu: a hard-to-translate concept of resilience, fortitude, courage and grit. Finnish-Canadian author Katja Pantzar, who has written extensively about this perceived national quality, explains that it's \"a mindset that allows people and communities to work together in the face of challenges rather than give up or blame and attack others\".\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n\u2022 The European region where young people are happiest\n\u2022 Turku: Finland's under-the-radar Nordic destination\nShe notes that the top four nations in the World Happiness Report are all Nordic countries with strong welfare systems designed to support the collective good. \"Happiness is very culturally specific,\" she said. \"In Finland, there are many examples of everyday happiness that are available and accessible to everyone, whether it's nature \u2013 every person in Finland is on average about 200m from the nearest forest, park, seashore or natural body of water \u2013 saunas, public libraries, safe and efficient public transport, free clean drinking water, education or healthcare.\"\nPantzar also highlights the mood-boosting properties of contrast therapy \u2013 hot saunas followed by cold dips \u2013 as an accessible, every-day mood booster. \"It's incredibly easy to do in Helsinki, surrounded by the sea,\" she says. \"When you don't need to travel great distances or pay large fees to have a quick dip, it's easier to do more regularly, before or after work or on your lunch break.\"\u00a0\nAnd while some Finns remain sceptical of the \"happiest nation\" label, most seem to appreciate what they have. \"I don't find it easy to think of Finland as the happiest country in the world,\" says pensioner Juha Roiha. \"In poorer countries like Thailand and Nepal, people seem relaxed in spite of any hardship. In Finland, you might sometimes hear people say that they'd be happier somewhere else. But within ourselves, with what we have, we're happy.\"\nHappy Land - Finding the Inner Finn, a travel memoir by Tim Bird, will be published by Eye Books in the UK in January 2026. It takes a \"sideways\" look at Finland's happiness status.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "\"Please be upstanding for the world's most confusing House of Games contestant and Bake Off failure, Self Esteem!\"\nThis is how Rebecca Lucy Taylor \u2013 aka celebrated pop singer Self Esteem \u2013 is introduced to the stage at London's Duke of York's Theatre.\nIt's a typically irreverent comment, an example of the dry wit she uses to sweeten the sincerity and anger of her music.\n\"You can take piccies and videos,\" the off-stage voice continues, \"because she needs all the help she can get.\"\nThat, too, is strictly tongue-in-cheek.\nThree years ago, Taylor released her second album, Prioritise Pleasure, a body-shaking manifesto for female self-worth that bristled at society's expectations while acknowledging her own shortcomings (\"Sexting you at the mental health talk seems counterproductive,\" she observed on Moody).\nAfter 10 years in mid-ranking indie band Slow Club, the album propelled her into uncharted realms.\nThere were magazine covers, nominations for the Mercury Prize and Brit Awards, a starring role on stage in Cabaret, a support slot with Adele and, yes, an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off \u2013 where, unfortunately, she burned her crumpets.\n\"The week that Prioritise Pleasure came out, my whole life changed,\" she reflects.\n\"Not financially or in terms of fame, but it's like there was a knot in my stomach that untied.\n\"Then everyone was like, 'Right, can you do that again, please?'\"\nTaylor tore herself in two to make the follow-up, A Complicated Woman, which comes out on Friday.\nAfter playing it live for the first time in the West End on Wednesday, she describes the album's gestation process as \"horrible\", \"lonely\", and \"painful\".\n\"It just felt really stressful to execute what was in my head,\" she explains in a phone interview the next morning.\n\"I was thinking so big, but I still don't have access to the resources I need to make it as big as I wanted.\"\nPart of the problem was a punishing, but self-imposed, time limit.\n\"The music industry is like, 'You've got 10 minutes, then you're over and someone else is going to take your place',\" she explains.\n\"So I felt like I had no choice [but to commit to another record] if I wanted to build on what I'd done.\n\"But as painful as it was and as dark as it got, the second I'm back on stage performing it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is why I love it'.\"\nShe hasn't just made a new album - she has also created a daring, jaw-dropping theatrical experience to go with it.\nIt's set in a sparse recreation of the community centre where eight-year-old Becky from Rotherham learned to tap dance.\n\"You just wanted to sing / You didn't know what that would bring,\" recalls an older, more cynical version of that child \u2013 as she assesses her life at the age of 38.\n\"This really is all there is, and that's what you've got to get comfortable with.\" \nAs the show opens, 10 dancers line up on either side of her, dressed in austere outfits that recall The Handmaid's Tale.\nInitially, their movements are stiff and restricted but, as Taylor describes suffocating relationships with emotionally-stunted men, they start to thrash and jerk their bodies.\n\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.\n\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"\nA four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.\nSeveral times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.\n\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?\n\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"\nIn the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.\nThe music becomes a soundtrack to solidarity - which, it transpires, was Taylor's intention. \nA Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.\n\"Do you remember the Elbow song One Day Like This?\" she asks. \"The one that goes, 'Throw those curtains wii-iide'?\n\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"\n\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"\nThat's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.\nRecent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.\n\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs. \n\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.\n\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"\nThose moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.\nHer personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.\n\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap. \n\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"\nIt's a feeling Taylor immediately recognised. \nAs excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.\n\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.\n\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"\nEventually, the criticism took its toll.\n\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.\n\"But over the last few years, especially with the world being like it is, I've definitely had feelings of protecting myself and shutting up.\n\"That's the saddest part of the album, really. But I found a way through.\n\"And if I can, then I hope the rest of the world can too, you know?\"\nThat realisation is the connecting tissue of A Complicated Woman.\nLife is never easy, she says. No-one is ever truly satisfied. Relationships are hard work. You can't please everyone. But that's OK. You're OK. Trust your gut.\nShe sums it up on Focus Is Power, held aloft by the sound of a gospel choir: \"And now I see it clear with every passing of each year / I deserve to be here.\"\nOn stage in London, she sings those final lines a capella with her dancers and backing singers, arms wrapped around each other in a display of female solidarity.\nIt's a cathartic moment after the bruising process of putting the album together.\n\"There's so much joy in being a woman and just being yourself can be beautiful,\" she says. \"You've just got to find a way to do it.\"\nWith that, she's off to make tweaks for the show's second night. After that, she has to find a way to scale down the West End production for a UK tour.\n\"I'll do what I can to make it continue, but it's a huge risk because there's so little revenue from anything else,\" she says. \nUltimately, though, her ambition is undimmed.\n\"I want to make 20 albums, I want to do bigger theatre shows,\" she says.\n\"Of course it'd be useful if I could 'cross over' because everything gets easier when you've got more resources.\n\"But last night I was like, 'Bloody hell, you did what you set out to do'. So I'm good.\"",

        "article_text": "When wedding dress designer Catherine Deane saw her company's Instagram account get hacked, she says it was \"devastating\".\n\"It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.\n\"To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work\u2026 it was just pulled.\"\nMs Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.\nOn Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.\nThis was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.\nSo her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.\nWhat added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.\nInitially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.\n\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"\nEventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.\nIn the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.\n\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.\nAccording to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.\n\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"\nHis company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"\nThe BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.\nHowever, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.\n\"We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.\"\nHackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.\nThe final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.\nHe got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.\nBecause his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (\u00a3900) to unlock the account.\nUnable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.\nThankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.\nMr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.\n\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.\nIn fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.\nHe tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.\n\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.\n\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"\nHe said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.\n\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.\n\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"\nThe BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.\nOne small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.\nMeanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts.\nLast autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. \"It had just disappeared,\" he says.\n\"There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost.\"\nThe page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU.\nMr Senadeera says that the customer support agents he spoke to at Meta, Facebook's owner, were baffled. He says they told him that they could see the page, but that it had been restricted, and that they couldn't unblock it.\nSix months later, and the page remains locked.\nMeta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful.\nMr Senadeera disputes that the firm has ever posted any harmful or misleading content. He says that Meta needs to do more, and move more quickly, to help firms get their Facebook and Instagram pages back, whether they have been a victim of fraud or not.",

        "article_text": "Carlo Ancelotti has won the Champions League three times with Real Madrid\nIn the build-up to Wednesday's night Champions League quarter-final tie at the Bernabeu against Arsenal, it felt like there was only one word on every Real Madrid fan's mind - remontada.\nThat is Spanish for comeback, and while Real Madrid sides of the past have produced stirring fightbacks from difficult positions to triumph, that never looked likely with this current team.\nReal were 3-0 down from a disappointing first-leg display at Emirates Stadium but, bar a brief moment of belief when Vinicius Jr cancelled out Bukayo Saka's second-half opener within two minutes, the holders never threatened to overturn the deficit.\nIt was Arsenal instead who fashioned a success to become the only side to win their first two games against Real at the Bernabeu. Gabriel Martinelli struck in stoppage time to secure a stunning 2-1 victory and 5-1 success on aggregate.\nThe post-mortem has already begun and, as Real Madrid face up the prospect of not being in the Champions League semi-finals for just the third time in 12 seasons, Carlo Ancelotti knows the questions about him and his players won't be going away anytime soon.\n\"We have the dark side and we have the bright side,\" said the Italian, who took charge of Real for a second spell in 2021 and has won the Champions League three times with the club.\n\"We have managed the bright side many times, we have won titles, we have won games. We have been eliminated [from the Champions League but] we have three more competitions we need to stay focused for.\"\nSpanish football expert Guillem Balague added: \"Real Madrid stand at the crossroads. They have a squad in need of refreshing.\n\"The defeat to Arsenal hasn't caused a reset, it has simply confirmed the need for it. For Ancelotti the message will be clear - it's time to move on.\"\nWho will win Champions League? BBC Sport's predictions\nSuperb Arsenal defeat Real to reach semi-finals\nThis video can not be played\nArsenal dominate against Real Madrid to reach semi-finals\nIt wasn't supposed to be this way. \nWhen the Spanish giants signed Kylian Mbappe in the summer after his contract expired at Paris St-Germain, a lot of people were wondering how this Madrid team full of superstars could be stopped. Many pundits suggested they couldn't., external\nBut after losing their European crown following the limp exit to Arsenal and facing a big fight to defend their La Liga title with Barcelona four points clear in top spot, Real's season is already being seen as a failure.\n\"This Real Madrid team is not at the level that these supporters expect,\" former Arsenal defender Matthew Upson told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"That's why I wouldn't be surprised if there were some changes at some point.\"\nAncelotti's future has been a subject of discussion in Spain for the majority of the season.\nThe 65-year-old has won 11 trophies in his second stint, including two league titles, two Champions Leagues and the Fifa Club World Cup.\nAncelotti is contracted until 2026 and - linked with the vacant Brazil job - has previously said he will discuss his future in the summer.\nAsked if he would still be in charge by the time the Club World Cup begins in June, Ancelotti said: \"I can't speak about this right now.\n\"It could be that the club decide to change [coach]. It could be this year - or the next when my contract expires, there's no problem.\n\"It could be tomorrow, in 10 days, in a month or a year, but all I can do will be to thank the club - if my contract's up or not, I don't care.\"\nAncelotti's managerial record is impressive and deserves respect, having won 20 major trophies, including five Champions Leagues, with two of them at AC Milan.\nBut, with Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso linked with a return,, external the club's hierarchy could decide now is the time to make the change.\n\"He won't be there next season,\" French football journalist Julien Laurens said on BBC Match of the Day.\n\"This was an embarrassment for Real Madrid. To lose 5-1 against a very good Arsenal team, but you still are the reigning champions and have some of the best players in the world.\"\nBalague added: \"Ancelotti thrives in environments with quality players who don't need to be over-coached.\n\"His job, in many ways, has been to keep the dressing room harmonious, egos balanced, and the belief high that Real Madrid can win any game, simply because they are Real Madrid. And that worked, to a point.\n\"But this season has highlighted the limits of that approach. Madrid have run less than their opponents in key games, while the second tier of talent - Arda Guler, Brahim D\u00edaz and even Endrick when available - have been underused. \n\"The load has fallen on a core group that now looks physically and mentally exhausted.\"\nTrent Alexander-Arnold has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid \nMany would argue the summer dismissal of Ancelotti would be an overreaction.\nAfter all, the Spaniards are still in with a shout of defending their La Liga title and have a Copa Del Rey final looming against Barcelona.\nBut after winning a 15th Champions League and La Liga last season, there's no hiding the fact this one has been disappointing so far.\nThey have lost 11 games in all competitions, while their performance in both legs against Arsenal were alarming.\nThey were a distant second best in the first leg and, while their fans did their part in the return with plenty of noise at the Bernabeu, the players failed to do theirs. \nReal did not manage a shot on target until 10 minutes into the second half, while their leveller came about after an uncharacteristic mistake by William Saliba.\n\"There was no plan tactically, it was an absolute mess,\" Laurens added. \n\"They have to change, they have to change their policy and their manager.\"\nBalague admitted: \"The warning signs have been there for months.\n\"Their Champions League elimination at the hands of Arsenal feels like a reckoning, the culmination of a season where, despite results, things have often looked off.\n\"Every match has been a grind. This Real Madrid side has looked like a team running on fumes.\"\nChange has already started for next season.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold looks set to arrive from Liverpool in the summer, while there could be some high-profile exits to follow.\n\"They need to make big calls now,\" said Laurens. \"Do you keep Vinicius Jr? What do you do with Rodrygo. It just cannot continue because that front four cannot work together.\"\nBalague also believed the squad needed a significant refresh to get the club back to where they want to be.\nHe said: \"This is a squad that needs new energy. Toni Kroos has never truly been replaced, the midfield lacks control. While Luka Modric remains a legend, the need for someone who can control the tempo without being 39 years old is obvious.\n\"The club has to face hard decisions this summer. Modric and Lucas V\u00e1zquez [contracts] may not be renewed. David Alaba, if a good offer comes in, could be allowed to leave.\"\nReal Madrid have some big decisions to make in the coming months as they look to ensure they are quickly battling for Champions League titles once again.",

Gabriel Martinelli struck in stoppage time to secure a stunning 2-1 victory and 5-1 success on aggregate.\nThe post-mortem has already begun and, as Real Madrid face up the prospect of not being in the Champions League semi-finals for just the third time in 12 seasons, Carlo Ancelotti knows the questions about him and his players won't be going away anytime soon.\n\"We have the dark side and we have the bright side,\" said the Italian, who took charge of Real for a second spell in 2021 and has won the Champions League three times with the club.\n\"We have managed the bright side many times, we have won titles, we have won games. We have been eliminated [from the Champions League but] we have three more competitions we need to stay focused for.\"\nSpanish football expert Guillem Balague added: \"Real Madrid stand at the crossroads. They have a squad in need of refreshing.\n\"The defeat to Arsenal hasn't caused a reset, it has simply confirmed the need for it. For Ancelotti the message will be clear - it's time to move on.\"\nWho will win Champions League? BBC Sport's predictions\nSuperb Arsenal defeat Real to reach semi-finals\nThis video can not be played\nArsenal dominate against Real Madrid to reach semi-finals\nIt wasn't supposed to be this way. \nWhen the Spanish giants signed Kylian Mbappe in the summer after his contract expired at Paris St-Germain, a lot of people were wondering how this Madrid team full of superstars could be stopped. Many pundits suggested they couldn't., external\nBut after losing their European crown following the limp exit to Arsenal and facing a big fight to defend their La Liga title with Barcelona four points clear in top spot, Real's season is already being seen as a failure.\n\"This Real Madrid team is not at the level that these supporters expect,\" former Arsenal defender Matthew Upson told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"That's why I wouldn't be surprised if there were some changes at some point.\"\nAncelotti's future has been a subject of discussion in Spain for the majority of the season.\nThe 65-year-old has won 11 trophies in his second stint, including two league titles, two Champions Leagues and the Fifa Club World Cup.\nAncelotti is contracted until 2026 and - linked with the vacant Brazil job - has previously said he will discuss his future in the summer.\nAsked if he would still be in charge by the time the Club World Cup begins in June, Ancelotti said: \"I can't speak about this right now.\n\"It could be that the club decide to change [coach]. It could be this year - or the next when my contract expires, there's no problem.\n\"It could be tomorrow, in 10 days, in a month or a year, but all I can do will be to thank the club - if my contract's up or not, I don't care.\"\nAncelotti's managerial record is impressive and deserves respect, having won 20 major trophies, including five Champions Leagues, with two of them at AC Milan.\nBut, with Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso linked with a return,, external the club's hierarchy could decide now is the time to make the change.\n\"He won't be there next season,\" French football journalist Julien Laurens said on BBC Match of the Day.\n\"This was an embarrassment for Real Madrid. To lose 5-1 against a very good Arsenal team, but you still are the reigning champions and have some of the best players in the world.\"\nBalague added: \"Ancelotti thrives in environments with quality players who don't need to be over-coached.\n\"His job, in many ways, has been to keep the dressing room harmonious, egos balanced, and the belief high that Real Madrid can win any game, simply because they are Real Madrid. And that worked, to a point.\n\"But this season has highlighted the limits of that approach. Madrid have run less than their opponents in key games, while the second tier of talent - Arda Guler, Brahim D\u00edaz and even Endrick when available - have been underused. \n\"The load has fallen on a core group that now looks physically and mentally exhausted.\"\nTrent Alexander-Arnold has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid \nMany would argue the summer dismissal of Ancelotti would be an overreaction.\nAfter all, the Spaniards are still in with a shout of defending their La Liga title and have a Copa Del Rey final looming against Barcelona.\nBut after winning a 15th Champions League and La Liga last season, there's no hiding the fact this one has been disappointing so far.\nThey have lost 11 games in all competitions, while their performance in both legs against Arsenal were alarming.\nThey were a distant second best in the first leg and, while their fans did their part in the return with plenty of noise at the Bernabeu, the players failed to do theirs. \nReal did not manage a shot on target until 10 minutes into the second half, while their leveller came about after an uncharacteristic mistake by William Saliba.\n\"There was no plan tactically, it was an absolute mess,\" Laurens added. \n\"They have to change, they have to change their policy and their manager.\"\nBalague admitted: \"The warning signs have been there for months.\n\"Their Champions League elimination at the hands of Arsenal feels like a reckoning, the culmination of a season where, despite results, things have often looked off.\n\"Every match has been a grind. This Real Madrid side has looked like a team running on fumes.\"\nChange has already started for next season.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold looks set to arrive from Liverpool in the summer, while there could be some high-profile exits to follow.\n\"They need to make big calls now,\" said Laurens. \"Do you keep Vinicius Jr? What do you do with Rodrygo. It just cannot continue because that front four cannot work together.\"\nBalague also believed the squad needed a significant refresh to get the club back to where they want to be.\nHe said: \"This is a squad that needs new energy. Toni Kroos has never truly been replaced, the midfield lacks control. While Luka Modric remains a legend, the need for someone who can control the tempo without being 39 years old is obvious.\n\"The club has to face hard decisions this summer. Modric and Lucas V\u00e1zquez [contracts] may not be renewed. David Alaba, if a good offer comes in, could be allowed to leave.\"\nReal Madrid have some big decisions to make in the coming months as they look to ensure they are quickly battling for Champions League titles once again.",

        "article_text": "When wedding dress designer Catherine Deane saw her company's Instagram account get hacked, she says it was \"devastating\".\n\"It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.\n\"To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work\u2026 it was just pulled.\"\nMs Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.\nOn Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.\nThis was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.\nSo her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.\nWhat added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.\nInitially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.\n\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"\nEventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.\nIn the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.\n\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.\nAccording to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.\n\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"\nHis company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"\nThe BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.\nHowever, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.\n\"We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.\"\nHackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.\nThe final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.\nHe got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.\nBecause his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (\u00a3900) to unlock the account.\nUnable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.\nThankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.\nMr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.\n\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.\nIn fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.\nHe tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.\n\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.\n\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"\nHe said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.\n\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.\n\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"\nThe BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.\nOne small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.\nMeanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts.\nLast autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. \"It had just disappeared,\" he says.\n\"There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost.\"\nThe page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU.\nMr Senadeera says that the customer support agents he spoke to at Meta, Facebook's owner, were baffled. He says they told him that they could see the page, but that it had been restricted, and that they couldn't unblock it.\nSix months later, and the page remains locked.\nMeta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful.\nMr Senadeera disputes that the firm has ever posted any harmful or misleading content. He says that Meta needs to do more, and move more quickly, to help firms get their Facebook and Instagram pages back, whether they have been a victim of fraud or not.",

        "article_text": "Rohit Sharma won five IPL titles as captain of Mumbai Indians in an 11-year leadership stint\nRohit Sharma has been under scrutiny for his poor form in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and his struggles so far in 2025 are consistent with a downward trend in the competition over the past three years. \nThe former Mumbai Indians captain, who still leads India's white-ball teams, has scored 82 runs in six innings at an average of 13.66.\nThe opener's 26 from 16 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday was his highest score this season, and with three sixes he showed some glimpses of a return to form before another soft dismissal off Pat Cummins. \n\"He's finding it very hard to be consistent,\" former IPL batter Abhishek Jhunjhunwala told BBC Sport.\nRohit's run drought has also mirrored his own team's form, as Mumbai have struggled to find a consistent winning combination - they are seventh in the table with three wins from seven. \nHowever, this is unique to Rohit in the IPL specifically as he is still having plenty of success internationally with a T20 World Cup win in 2024 and the Champions Trophy title last month. \nHe is also a Mumbai legend having led them to five titles in 11 years as captain, while he is set to have a stand named after him at the iconic Wankhede stadium.\nBut with that success and status comes immense expectation. BBC Sport and CricViz data analyst Soham Sarkhel have looked at the numbers behind Rohit's decline, and what he and Mumbai could do next.\nKeep up to date with the Indian Premier League\nIPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers\nRohit's average in the IPL is 29.30, but since 2022 he averages 22.89 at the top of the order. That is the second-lowest of the 21 openers to play 20-plus innings.\nHe averages 13.66 in six matches this season - and it is 12.89 if you add the final three games of 2024.\nHis form in T20 internationals hasn't declined in the same way. Since the start of 2022 he averages 29.34 in T20Is compared to 22.89 in the IPL as an opener.\nRohit's best returns in the IPL have come at five (average of 33.11) and four. (average of 32.7). That drops to 27.74 as an opener, with him only averaging more than 30 in 2016 and 2024 (min five innings).\nRohit Sharma has been dismissed in the six-over powerplay in all six of his innings in the 2025 IPL\nAgainst pace in the six-over powerplay his average has dropped from 36.47 to 24.39 since 2022.\nHe has only survived past the powerplay in 12 of his 36 IPL innings since the start of 2023 and is yet to bat outside the powerplay this year.\nThe right-hander used to be a 'balanced' player with 51% of runs in that phase scored on the leg side, but that has climbed to 59%. \nThat could contribute to a decline in his numbers against outswinging deliveries and a rise against inswingers. Before 2022 he averaged 27 against inswingers and close to 50 against outswingers but since then, those numbers are 44 and 19. \nHe used to average 63 against outswingers from right-arm pacers in the powerplay, now it is 16.\nBetween 2014 and 2021 Rohit was out seven times to left-arm seamers and averaged 28.85. Since 2022 he has been dismissed eight times and averages 22.37. It equates for 24% of the balls he has faced too, up from 13%. \nRohit is also struggling against spin. He averages 15.33 since 2022, down from 34.68. \nThere is a particular weakness against leg-spin, which he averages 7.88 against since 2022. \nThe sweep shot is also getting him into trouble. He used it just 7% of the time between 2014 and 2021 and was out eight times. That was climbed to 21% of deliveries since 2022 and he has been dismissed six times, at an average of 15.5.\nThat's a trend in all formats with Rohit's last 30 sweep shots across all formats seeing him dismissed seven times, at an average of seven. \nMumbai's most recent IPL title came in 2020, having also won the previous year, and Rohit was replaced as skipper by Hardik Pandya in 2024 - but in the all-rounder's first edition in charge, they finished bottom of the table. \nRohit's legendary status with the side is likely to earn him a longer run in order to solve his personal batting problems, but it could present the Mumbai hierarchy with a brave call to make if he cannot regain form - and if the team maintains its inconsistency, too. \n\"There is a lot of pressure on him, especially when he's playing for India,\" Jhunjhunwala added.\n\"In the IPL, they are ruthless as we've seen with so many players, and we've seen that with Mumbai Indians.\n\"There will be patience with him, especially at Mumbai, because he's done brilliantly for them over the years.\n\"He's still got it. I just feel that he's maybe lost a bit of hand-eye coordination and that can happen, but your career can really go down quite quickly. He's got to work on a lot of things, especially his fitness.\"\nFormer England bowler Tymal Mills, who played with Rohit at Mumbai in 2022, also backed him to rediscover his best form and described him as \"a nightmare for bowlers\" when in full flow. \n\"He's one of the most experienced players in the world, he has been there and done it at the highest level for a very long time,\" Mills told BBC Sport.\n\"He will stick to his processes, he will hit a lot of balls. You'll always see him going to training early and getting his extra work done before everyone else arrives. \n\"When you have played as long as Rohit has, you're going to go through bad spells. Players of his class always re-emerge.\n\"He has earned the right to get a long leash because he's had such a successful career and been a nightmare for bowlers.\"\nMills also questioned whether being the impact sub - which Rohit has been in five of his six games, including three times when batting second - was a \"hindrance\" because it could \"take you a bit longer to get into the game\". \nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The president of the largest communal body of Jews in the UK has responded to an open letter signed by some of its representatives criticising Israel's offensive in Gaza.\nPhil Rosenberg, president of The Board of Deputies of British Jews, said he disagreed with the letter, which he said \"lays blame squarely on the Israeli Government\".\nHe also criticised the letter, published in the Financial Times, for \"barely\" mentioning Hamas and the role he said it had played in the breakdown of hostage release negotiations.\nOn Tuesday, 36 members, or Deputies, signed the letter, saying it was their \"duty, as Jews, to speak out\".\nIt was the first show of opposition to the Gaza war by some of the Board's members - which is made up of more than 300 Deputies.\nWriting in an opinion piece published in the Jewish News on Thursday, Mr Rosenberg said: \"Whether intentionally or otherwise, the impression that has now been put forward by certain national and international news outlets is that yesterday's letter published in the Financial Times, signed by approximately ten percent of Deputies, is the position of the Board of Deputies as an organisation, and therefore the position of the UK Jewish community as a whole. \n\"This is emphatically not the case, and as president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, I speak for the organisation as a whole.\"\nHe said the signatories \"are now experiencing what I and other senior Board representatives know all too well; that it is remarkably easy to get the media to listen to you in this country if you highlight your Jewish identity while vocally criticising Israel or its government\".\nMr Rosenberg criticised the letter for the lack of mention of Hamas, stating that it gives the group \"absolutely no agency... regarding the failure of the implementation of the second stage of the hostage deal\".\nIsrael resumed its offensive on Gaza last month after the first stage of a three-part ceasefire deal expired. It blamed Hamas for refusing to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, while Hamas accused Israel of reneging on its commitment to hold talks on the second stage.\nThe Board president accused Hamas of rejecting the latest ceasefire proposal, saying: \"Given that Hamas just this week rejected yet another mediation put forward via Egypt, which would have required the terrorist group to disarm, I am simply unable to agree with the viewpoint aired in the FT letter which lays blame squarely on the Israeli Government. \n\"I am confident that the vast majority of Deputies and the Jewish community as a whole agree with me.\"\nHe added that he believed the signatories of the open letter \"have a strong and completely genuine concern for the situation in Israel and Gaza\".\nMr Rosenberg also visited Israel on Thursday, where he met Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Saar.\nIn a post on social media, featuring a picture of the two shaking hands, Mr Rosenberg wrote: \"@BoardofDeputies is clear: Jewish leadership is standing up for peace & security in Israel & the Middle East:\n\"Getting hostages out, defeating Hamas, pursuing lasting peace & security.\n\"Unity is strength. Division serves only our enemies.\"\nIn Wednesday's open letter, signatories took aim at the Israeli government, warning \"Israel's soul is being ripped out\".\nThe letter accused Israel's government of choosing to \"break the ceasefire and return to war in Gaza\", rather than engage in diplomacy and agree the next phase of a ceasefire deal.\nIsrael blocked the entry of food, medicine and other supplies on 2 March, a day after the first phase of the ceasefire expired, saying it did so to pressure Hamas. It resumed the war two weeks later.\nIsrael launched its military campaign after Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 51,065 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

It blamed Hamas for refusing to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, while Hamas accused Israel of reneging on its commitment to hold talks on the second stage.The Board president accused Hamas of rejecting the latest ceasefire proposal, saying: \"Given that Hamas just this week rejected yet another mediation put forward via Egypt, which would have required the terrorist group to disarm, I am simply unable to agree with the viewpoint aired in the FT letter which lays blame squarely on the Israeli Government. \"He said the signatories \"are now experiencing what I and other senior Board representatives know all too well; that it is remarkably easy to get the media to listen to you in this country if you highlight your Jewish identity while vocally criticising Israel or its government\".Mr Rosenberg criticised the letter for the lack of mention of Hamas, stating that it gives the group \"absolutely no agency... regarding the failure of the implementation of the second stage of the hostage deal\".Israel resumed its offensive on Gaza last month after the first stage of a three-part ceasefire deal expired. Division serves only our enemies.",

And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,\" he said, adding that he expects to cut deals with every country \"over the next three to four weeks\".\nTrump also suggested thathe was reluctant to further raise tariffs on China - which currently stand at 145%. \n\"I may not want to go higher. I may want to go to less because you know, you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nAt a press conference on Thursday following Trump's and Meloni's conversation, the leaders said they had discussed defence spending, immigration and tariffs.\nThe atmosphere in the Oval Office appeared relaxed and good-natured - similar to the reception UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received during his visit to the White House in February.\nHowever Meloni's aides had described the visit as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's decision to impose a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US. \nHe has strongly criticised the European Union on trade, claiming it was \"formed to screw the United States\". A 20% \"retaliatory\" tariff on the EU has been temporarily suspended until July.\nMeloni previously called the tariffs \"absolutely wrong\" and said they would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\nWhile she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.\nGiven the fraught relations between the EU and the US, Meloni will likely chalk that up as a significant win, particularly if Trump agrees to meet the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, during the visit.\nMeloni will return to Europe with stronger credentials as the so-called \"Trump whisperer\", something that will be reinforced when she meets US Vice President JD Vance in Rome tomorrow.\nThe Italian leader was careful to praise Trump and align herself with the US president's viewpoints.\nIn her statement following the meeting, she criticised \"woke ideology\" and championed the \"war against illegal migration\".\n\"The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,\" she added.\nShe also seized the opportunity to tout the work of her own government. \"I'm proud of sitting here as prime minister of an Italy that today has a very good situation - a stable country, a reliable country,\" Meloni said. \nShe noted that her government had brought inflation down and improved employment, before gesturing towards Trump and adding with a broad smile: \"Forgive me if I promote my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me\". Trump grinned back.\nMeloni basked in the praise lavished on her by Trump - from compliments about her work as prime minister to gushing about her Italian sounding \"beautiful\".\nThe US president praised Meloni for taking a tough stance on immigration and said he wished more people were like her. Meloni said that change was happening, thanks to the example set by Italy, referring to yesterday's EU announcement on safe countries.\nIt was only occasionally that she showed a tinge of irritation when asked about Italy's low defence spending.\nMeloni said that she expects Italy to announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to meet the alliance's requirement that each member nation spends 2% of GDP on defence.\nDefence spending has been a key sticking point for Trump, with the US leader repeatedly demanding that Nato allies increase spending. \nItaly is one of eight countries that currently does not meet the 2% threshold, spending 1.49% on defence.\nItalian opposition leader Carlo Calenda said there had been \"two very positive outcomes\" from the visit: that Meloni \"stayed on track on Ukraine and managed to convince Trump to meet EU figures in Italy\".\nCalenda said Meloni had \"gained credibility as a bridge between the US and the EU\" but criticised her praise of \"Trump's fight on woke culture\".",

        "article_text": "After British actress Aimee Lou Wood called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth \"mean and unfunny,\" impressionists have told BBC News how they tread the line between being funny and offensive.\nIt all began with five minutes on NBC last Saturday night. \nTitled The White Potus - a spin on hit HBO dark comedy The White Lotus - a SNL sketch depicted US president Donald Trump, his family and top team spending time at a fictional tropical hotel.\nAfter jokes showing Eric Trump blending a gold Rolex watch and Ivanka Trump rejecting a spiritual call to give up material wealth, Wood's White Lotus character Chelsea is portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and large teeth.\nIn response to a comment made by a character playing US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"\nThe mineral is added to some water supplies and brands of toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay.\nFor BBC Radio 4's Dead Ringers star Jan Ravens, the first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was \"not reading the room\".\nIt was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking \"those all-American, fake-looking teeth\".\n\"In the wake of all that, she's been talking about how she was bullied at school and the butt of jokes. So then you think, 'why would you do that joke'?\"\nIt meant that in making fun of Wood's appearance, the sketch \"punched down,\" says Ravens.\n\"You might make a joke about Donald Trump's appearance because you're definitely not punching down on the most powerful man in the western world.\"\nRonni Ancona, co-writer and star of the early 2000s TV series The Big Impression, said she \"could see\" that the writers were also trying to make a point about US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's pledge to remove fluoride from US drinking water.\nBut in doing so, \"they would have made this tenuous link between fluoride and Aimee Lou's teeth. It's a bit of a cheap shot,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.\nAfter the show aired, Wood, 31, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".\n\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday. \"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"\nLater on, in a post on social media, she said: \"I've had apologies from SNL.\"\nHowever, Francine Lewis, a comedian whose impersonations have earned her a large following on social media, says the whole purpose of the US show is to \"take the mick\".\nWhile she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".\nIn her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".\nIn recent times, both fans and some of her targets have taken offence. \n\"I don't know if it's just the new generation of young people that just take offence to every little thing,\" she says.\n\"People that say you're a troll, you're a bully... I find myself hiding at celebrity events because I think 'oh I do their impression, they might not like me'.\"\nBut she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".\nRather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"\nIt's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image. \n\"What caricaturists do by nature... is exaggerate the physicality. If a caricaturist is stopped from doing that, there's no point in him being a caricaturist,\" he says.\nDuring the 1980s, one of his targets - former Labour minister Roy Hattersley - was mocked for a slight speech impediment, with water spurting out of his mouth as he spoke.\n\"The joke was Roy Hattersley spits,\" says Nallon, who adds that Hattesley allegedly got on board with the joke after initially taking offence.\nFor Nallon, those in the public eye will always be fair game. \"Maybe it's not a bad lesson to learn that you've got to have the mickey taken out of you occasionally,\" he says.\nBut times have changed. Ravens says that \"people are much more sensitive\" about targeting certain aspects of people's appearances and mannerisms \"than they used to be earlier on in my career, for example, and I think rightly so\".\nThis is not the first time SNL has received criticism of their portrayals.\nIt doesn't mean the comedy is lost, says Ravens. In political satire - which was the main thrust of the SNL sketch - a really good impression satirises what the person is saying, rather than just fixating on how they look or how they deliver it, she adds.\nDuring our phone interview, she seamlessly breaks into an impression of former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but notes that just speaking in a tense, clipped way, \"is only good for one line really\".\n\"You're pricking pomposity and you're exposing hypocrisy. That's the point of satire.\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

It is the fastest growing neurological condition in the world, with about 153,000 people in the UK living with the condition.\nAlison Anderson from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, is one of those people. Like many, she awakes at about 08:00 to the twinkling crescendo of her morning alarm. \nBut unlike many others, this sound shatters the silence six more times throughout her day, reminding her to take her medication. \nThe slightest delay in her dosage, known as off-time, risks her symptoms surfacing and her experiencing anything from tremors to memory difficulties or poor balance.\n\"When this happens, even the simplest of tasks becomes challenging,\" she said. \n\"I become mentally and physically slower, I can't think straight and struggle to speak without forgetting what I'm trying to say. \n\"It's frustrating, at times embarrassing, and it interferes with pretty much everything I'm trying to do,\" she said.\nMs Anderson was diagnosed with the condition in 2015, which at the time came as a \"devastating\" blow.\nBut over the years, she has gradually \"learned to adjust\" to her symptoms, and even discovered a \"slower pace of life\" has made her more appreciative.\nThe 54-year-old has found a close-knit community comprised of four other women with the disease, whom she meets with every week for coffee, cake and a catch-up.\n\"Because we are all facing similar challenges, we are uniquely placed to help and support each other,\" she said.\n\"We also encourage, and at times, coerce each other into trying new things and keeping active. I try to enjoy life and live it to the fullest.\"\nOther symptoms of Parkinson's can include sensory issues, voice changes, facial masking\u00a0- where people experience a reduced ability to express emotions through facial movements - and sleep difficulties. \nAs Glyn Evans from Lydney explains: \"You get distressing dreams most nights. I wake up every couple of hours, sometimes in a ball of sweat.\" \nMr Evans was diagnosed with Parkinson's tremor after noticing a slight shake in his right hand several years ago.\nThis quickly progressed to jaw and tongue tremors, stiffness, severe backache and loss of balance. \nThe 78-year-old said life continues regardless, and he has \"found ways to cope\" with the condition.\n\"What would I say to people about my condition? Don't feel sorry for me,\" he said.\n\"Try to understand that Parkinson's has changed my life but it won't kill me.\"\nMichael Pearce, from Hardwicke, told the BBC his symptoms manifest in the form of fatigue, mobility issues, tremors and urinary incontinence. \n\"I'm very self-conscious at times, frustrated and uncertain,\" he said. \"But only once or twice did I get angry about it. It's nobody's fault, it just is.\n\"The other big thing for me was I stopped being creative. I used to write songs and my sense of humour diminished. Thankfully, these are coming back.\"\nMr Pearce said prescribed medication has since improved his quality of life, but true acceptance of his diagnosis came from within. \n\"I endeavour not to worry about an unknown future,\" he explained.\n\"Parkinson's has been a wake up call about life's priorities, not taking people and things for granted.\n\"This definitely helped in my case, keeping me grounded and philosophical about the situation. I express gratitude for the things I can still do.\" \nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630.",

        "article_text": "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted. \nEarlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.\nActors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.\nTheir performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.\nPerhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era. \nOn the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double). \nBut on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".\nSo should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?\nBeatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism. \n\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief. \n\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"\nDu Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.\n\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"\nBut he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.\n\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"\nSo does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?\nDu Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch. \n\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"\nEdda Sharpe, a Merseyside-based voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.\nAmong them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.\nBeatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it. \nThe performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.\n\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.\n\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"\nShe said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.\nBut she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.\n\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.\n\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"\nDr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.\nHe said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.\n\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.\n\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.\n\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"\nBut what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films? \nMichael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.\nHawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can. \n\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.\n\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.\n\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"\nThe 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.\nHe added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.\n\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds\nThere are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. \nOne such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.\nNow, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.\n\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\nBut all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?\nOur ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.\nIt was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.\nBut decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.\nPart of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look. \nUntil relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. \nAlthough astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.\nMany are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. \nBut many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.\nAs these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. \nThe idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.\nAnd they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.\nNasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.\nBut JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)\nAlso coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. \nIt has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.\nProf Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. \nInstead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.\nEventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.\n\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".\nThe world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. \nIn similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.\nA much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.\nThe scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.\nChina's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.\nBut the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.\n\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. \n\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".\nNasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\". \nAlong with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.\nProf Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?\n\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.\n\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.\nIf simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.\nProf Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"\nDr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.\n\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.\n\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"\nHe believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.\nAs he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.\nProf Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.\n\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.\n\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".\nNever before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.\n\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.\n\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.\n\"It will be another step in our evolution\".\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Michele Kang has been labelled the first tycoon in women's football\nSuccess is synonymous with Olympique Lyonnais Feminin.\nSince being established in 2004, the French club have become one of the superpowers in women's football, lifting 38 trophies across the domestic and European stage.\nTheir record in the Women's Champions League is unparalleled, winning the competition eight times in an 11-year period between 2011 and 2022.\nWhile Lyon remain a formidable force in the women's game, with a record-extending 12th European final appearance on the horizon if they overcome Arsenal over the next fortnight, other teams are catching up in terms of both investment and on-field success. \nIn recent years they have been usurped on the European stage by fellow semi-finalists Barcelona, who are just three matches from a third Champions League title in a row.\nAfter nearly two decades as the passion project of former Lyon owner Jean-Michel Aulas, the club have turned to trailblazing American businesswoman Michele Kang to give them a new lease of life. BBC World Service's World Football podcast has taken a closer look at the club's unique journey.\nOlympique Lyonnais: The Champions League trailblazers\nThe women's football investors 'ripping up blueprint' on club ownership\nIs this the future of the Women's Championship?\nAulas established OL Feminin in 2004\nFor more than 30 years, local businessman Aulas was Lyon.\nAfter becoming owner and president in 1987, following pleas from the city's mayor and F1 legend Alain Prost, he oversaw the men's club's transformation from a debt-ridden club languishing in the second tier to serial trophy-winners throughout the 2000s.\nDetermined to replicate that success in women's football, he launched OL Feminin in 2004 and, under his ownership, the club attracted top overseas players, championed French talent like Wendie Renard, and opened France's first mixed-gender academy.\nIt took three years to deliver silverware, winning the Premiere Ligue in 2006-07. The rest is history.\n\"This guy was ahead of his time,\" former Lyon defender Lucy Bronze told the BBC's World Service. \"To have someone that powerful say I want the women's team to do well, I want them to be the best, I want to give them everything.\n\"He was the first one [to invest in women's football], not just with his money but with physically being there and how much he cared about the team. He enjoyed it just as much as the girls. He celebrated just as hard as we did.\"\nBronze is one of a number of superstars in the women's game to have played for Lyon\nAulas' ownership ended in 2022 when Eagle Football became the majority shareholders of the OL Groupe, which encompassed both the men's and women's teams - as well as a majority stake in NWSL side Seattle Reign, and he resigned from his 36-year presidency the following year.\nIn 2023, the women's team changed hands again, with South Korea-born American businesswoman Kang, who made her fortune in healthcare IT, taking on majority ownership and making it a separate entity - \"independent\" - from the men's team.\n\"We have reached the end of our model a bit,\" chief executive Vincent Ponsot said. \"I think we needed a new lease of life, a new project. That is exactly what Michele brought with a much more global vision.\n\"We now see clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Barcelona. There is competition and our ambition is to remain one of the best European clubs. If Michele had not arrived, I think it would have been almost impossible because we need France to move much faster than it does today.\"\nKang also owns Washington Spirit and London City Lionesses\nDescribed by the Financial Times as \"arguably the first tycoon in women's football\", Kang is a relative latecomer to football.\nShe first became interested in the sport after meeting the World Cup-winning US women's team in 2019 and has since built up a portfolio of teams under her Kynisca Sports International group. In addition to Lyon, she has been the majority owner of NWSL team Washington Spirit since 2022 and purchased Women's Championship side London City Lionesses in 2023.\n\"I realised these are the best of the best athletes around the world,\" Kang said, reflecting on her meeting with the USWNT.\n\"I saw a significant lack of resources and attention. I saw the possibility of how women's football could explode with a little nudge and a little investment. \n\"I am not alone and there are a lot of people who share the same passion. Two billion people watch the World Cup - it's growing.\"\nKang's interest isn't limited to multi-club ownership, however, with a number of multi-million pound investments in women's sport, including a \u00a339m global investment in improving the health of elite female athletes.\nHer plans for Lyon are no less grand. Her long-term ambitions include the construction of a dedicated women's centre, with a 15-18,000-seater stadium and a bigger training facility, while she has already invested heavily in improving the club's backroom staff.\n\"The first thing she said to me was 'Vincent, what do you have to do for the OL women's team to have the same supervisions as the professional men's team?'. That was in August 2023,\" Ponsot said.\n\"I told her, 'we have to hire 11 people to the staff', and she said, 'go on then'. Two months later, we had 11 more people and 24 staff to improve the support to players so they can perform.\n\"The main thing we have evolved is in the performance sector. We have full-time nutritionists, physiotherapists, doctors, a performance manager, a psychologist. We have everything we need for the players to be in the best conditions to perform like the men's team.\"\nLyon midfielder and USA captain Lindsey Heaps added: \"[Michele] is incredible. I have never seen anything like this in the women's game, the sort of investment but also the way she speaks.\n\"When she took over she was a bit shocked that it was such a prestigious club and still [have] things that we need. Sometimes you can look at it and think 'they have Champions League trophies, they are winning every single game' [but] it's still not to the standard we need.\"\nLyon have attracted some 15,000-20,000 fans to Groupama Stadium for big Champions League games, but play most of their home matches at the 1,500-seater Gerard Houllier Stadium  \nAnother of Kang's priorities is increasing attendances at Lyon fixtures. \n\"If you ask many female players what is at the top of your wishlist, they don't say I want to get paid more, I want bigger cars. They say, 'I want to play against the best players and best teams in a sellout stadium'. It's my job that we fill the stadium,\" she said.\nLyon will travel to Emirates Stadium on Saturday (12:30 BST) for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final with Arsenal - a stadium where the Gunners recorded an average attendance of 52,029 across six matches last season.\n\"When you see that Arsenal are filling Emirates Stadium, there is no reason why we can't,\" said Ponsot. \"We realised that women's football has an audience with a strong increase in appetite, but we are having trouble making it a reality.\"\nLyon are on course for a record-extending 18th league title this season, having already booked their place in May's end-of-season play-offs. Indeed, they have only lost two league matches over the past four seasons.\nThat sustained success, coupled with Aulas' unmatched support, is seen by some as having had a negative impact on crowds, media interest, and investment in France.\nWomen's football journalist Assile Toufaily said: \"Some will say 'why should we come and watch football that isn't attractive because the level isn't that good?' We know OL are going to smash the other clubs 7-0. Fans aren't intrigued to come and watch.\n\"They say if you want to have a better level of football, investors have to invest. Investors will then say why should we invest if the media isn't promoting the game? So you find yourself in a vicious circle and it's been like this for years.\"\nBut she does not see Aulas' investment as the problem. \n\"If he didn't invest in 2004, maybe no-one would ever have done it in France. Aulas isn't to blame, but maybe the problem is others didn't follow along.\"\nKang, unsurprisingly, is undaunted by this, working with Ponsot to \"find the profile\" of women's football fans, with their own research indicating only a 5% overlap between fans who watch men's and women's matches.\nShe will likely find a powerful ally in Aulas, who was elected vice-president of the French Football Federation in December 2023 and has taken over responsibility for development of women's football. \n\"The French league is going to be very strong in years to come,\" vowed Aulas.\n\"If I acted badly before by being too strong [when I was] with Lyon, you can expect me to act badly [in my role] with France.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "The leaders of Canada's four major federal parties have been grilled about their response to US President Donald Trump and clashed over energy and housing in their first televised debate of the country's election campaign.\nThe French-language face-off marked a key moment in the election as it gave leaders a chance to woo voters in the seat-rich province of Quebec. \nIt was also a big test for Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has a slight lead in the polls, but whose French is the weakest among the federal leaders. He at times struggled to articulate his points on stage.\nThere is a second debate in English on Thursday, before Canadians vote on 28 April. \nOn the stage were the four main party candidates: Liberal leader and current Prime Minister Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, and leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh. \nThe debate was moderated by Radio-Canada journalist Patrice Roy. \nMr Roy opened the forum saying that Canada's short 36-day federal election had been \"hijacked by Trump\", and asked each leader to outline two campaign promises unrelated to the US or its tariffs.\nBut soon afterwards, Mr Roy plunged into a question on how each party would handle the trade war with the US, calling it the \"elephant in the room\". \nTrump has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars. \nThe president has also publicly mused about Canada becoming the 51st US state. \nPoilievre, of the opposition Conservatives, accused the governing Liberals of weakening the country over the past decade, making Canada more vulnerable to economic threats.\nCarney touted his experience as a former central banker for both Canada and the UK, as well as his time in the private sector.\n\"[Trump] respects people who understand the world and how the private sector works,\" Carney said. \nSingh, of the left-leaning NDP, sought to paint both Poilievre and Carney as the wrong option for Canadians whose jobs may be affected by US tariffs.\n\"Both will cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires,\" he said.\nFor Carney, the French-language debate was arguably the first major test of the campaign trail. \nA second debate will be held on Thursday night with the contenders speaking in English.\nThat forum will be more widely watched nationwide, but the stakes were high on Wednesday for Carney's Liberals, which are leading in Quebec where the majority of French-speaking Canadians live.\nHis French was the weakest on stage, and he often kept his answers brief and sometimes struggled to get his points across in a debate format with opportunities for rapid exchanges.\nHe also faced the most frequent attacks as the others leaders tried to tie him to the Liberal record of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned last month. \n\"We are still talking about the same party, the same caucus,\" the Bloc's Blanchet said. \nHe added: \"It's not because you change the leader that you change your philosophy.\"\nCarney countered that he had accomplishments despite only being sworn in as PM last month. He had \"just arrived\", he said. \nThere was a moment of levity when Mr Roy asked the leaders if they were buying fewer US products - like many Canadians are in the face of tariffs - at the grocery store. \nCarney had admitted in an interview early this month that he does not do his own groceries when asked if he still buys US strawberries. \nSingh and Blanchet both said they bought Canadian berries. Carney said he had given up US wine, while Poilievre said he buys Canadian beef. \nTrump was not the only issue on the agenda. The leaders were asked about their plan to address Canada's housing crisis, and how they would balance climate and the economy.\nOn housing, Poilievre vowed to cut taxes and red tape that he says act as a barrier to home building. \n\"We don't need more bureaucracy, we need more front doors,\" the Conservative leader said in a jab directed at Carney. \nBut the two found common ground on energy, saying the country should ramp up its oil and gas production. \nCarney said climate remains a priority for his party, adding that he would focus on producing \"low-risk\", \"low-carbon\" oil. \nOn immigration, there was also wide agreement that Canada must look at its capacity to integrate newcomers and asylum seekers. \nCanada has seen a rapid population boom in recent years and social and housing infrastructure has struggled to catch up.\nCanadian border officials recently noted an uptick in asylum seekers looking to cross the Quebec-US border as a result of the Trump administration's hardline  immigration policies.\nAbsent from the debate stage was the Green Party. In a last-minute decision by the debate commission, it was disqualified for failing to meet the criteria by not endorsing candidates in at least 90% of Canada's federal ridings, or constituencies. \nThe party, which had two MPs in parliament when the election was called, also failed to meet the threshold of at least 4% in national support. \nGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Pedneault called the commission's decision \"baseless\" and \"undemocratic\". \nIt wasn't the only change to the debate. \nOn Tuesday, the start time was officially moved forward by two hours to accommodate an NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Carolina Hurricanes, with a spot in the Stanley Cup play-offs at stake.",

        "article_text": "Before Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty, the Canadian psyche was consumed with another major issue: housing affordability. With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem. \nWillow Yamauchi says she was just a \"regular\" person when she and her husband bought their family home in Vancouver 25 years ago for a modest sum of C$275,000 - around C$435,000 ($312,000; \u00a3236,400) in today's dollars.\nThat same property is now worth several million. \nIn the city in Canada's pacific northwest, Ms Yamauchi's story is as common as the rainy weather. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000. Now, it is more than C$2m.\n\"My husband and I were very privileged to be able to purchase a house when we did,\" the 52-year-old writer tells the BBC. As a member of Generation X, timing was on her side. \nThe same, she says, cannot be said for younger people, who - without \"the bank of mom and dad\" - are effectively priced out of the city they grew up in.\nVancouver, a cultural and economic hub with a population of less than one million, is often seen as the epicentre of Canada's housing crisis. A report by Chapman University in California last year listed it among the top \"impossibly unaffordable\" cities in the world. \nBut it is not the only Canadian city where the cost of homes is out of reach for many. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations.\nIn 2021, the average household income after taxes in Canada was around C$88,000, according to national data. That same year, the average home price hit C$713,500 - more than eight times higher. The gap is even larger in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.\nFor many Canadians, housing is one of the top issues in the federal election, eclipsed only recently by US President Donald Trump and his tariffs on Canada. Before Trump, concerns on housing affordability had boosted the Conservative Party, which has consistently been seen as the best equipped to fix the crisis. Its success on pocketbook issues in general had threatened to collapse of the governing Liberal party, which only recently catapulted to the top of the polls in the wake of a trade war with the US.\nEven with the Trump factor, the topic featured prominently in the two federal leaders debate this week. During the French debate, moderator and journalist Patrice Roy displayed figures showing how much home prices had increased in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the last decade. \n\"I'm sure this won't come as a surprise,\" Mr Roy told the federal leaders, before asking for their plans on how they would fix the crisis.\nPolls show young people are especially worried about the housing crisis and what it means for their future. \nSpeaking to students at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Vancouver campus, it quickly became clear that the issue was top of mind for many.\nMany said they have either opted to live at home during their studies to save on costs, or are paying anywhere from C$1,100 to C$1,500 for a single room near campus, often in a home shared with five or six others.\nEmily Chu, a 24-year-old who is in her final semester at UBC, says that she at one point had to delay her studies by two years in order to work, as she struggled to afford paying both tuition and rent.\nShe now shares an apartment with her older brother, who works full-time and pays the majority of the rent. Ms Chu considers herself one of the lucky ones.\nAs for home ownership in the future, she says \"that's not even possible\" for most people her age. \"Everybody kind of assumes that we can't ever own housing.\"\nYoung professionals with well-paying jobs, like Margareta Dovgal, are also priced out. The 28-year-old director at Vancouver-based non-profit Resource Works told the BBC that she has considered moving to the neighbouring province of Alberta due to its lower cost of living, despite being a lifelong and \"committed Vancouverite\".\nStill, Calgary, Alberta's largest city, saw house prices increase by 15% in 2024 from the previous year as the city experienced its highest population growth rate since 2001.\nThe root causes of Canada's housing affordability crisis are complex. One of the main issues is a supply that has not kept up with a growing population, which has driven up costs for both buyers and renters. \nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the national housing agency, estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage.\nConstruction of new housing, however, has been well below that target, raising questions on whether Canada will meet this goal. Experts say barriers to ramping up building include the high cost and scarcity of land in urban areas, where most Canadians tend to live and work.\nThere are also regional barriers, like city zoning laws that prevent the construction of more affordable, higher density housing - including apartment buildings or multiplexes - in some neighbourhoods.\nDaniel Oleksiuk, co-founder of the advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says his city is one example, where more than half of the land has historically been zoned for single-family homes.\n\"We've kept almost all of the land reserved,\" Mr Oleksiuk told the BBC. \"There are whole neighbourhoods where all you have is three to five million dollar homes.\"\nOn the campaign trail, each major federal party has put forward a plan to fix the crisis, all with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.\nThe Liberals, led by Mark Carney, said their aim is to build 500,000 new homes a year with the help of a new government agency called Build Canada Homes that would oversee and finance the construction of affordable housing in Canada - a plan similar to one implemented after the Second World War to house veterans.\nCritics have questioned whether Carney's target is viable, as it would require Canada to more than double its current construction rate.\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, vowed to tie federal funding to housing starts by rewarding cities that build more homes and penalising those that block construction - a carrot-and-stick approach. \nPoilievre also promised to remove federal taxes on newly constructed homes in an effort to cut costs to would-be homebuyers. Critics, however, say this policy may have minimal effect, as most homes purchased in Canada are resold, rather than brand new.\nVoters who spoke to the BBC say they welcome any plan to ramp up housing construction in Canada.\nWhile much of housing is governed by provinces and cities, Ms Dovgal notes that the federal government has an ability \"to lead persuasively\" and implement measures that make it cheaper and easier to build across the country. \nBut others watching the issue closely caution that the steps proposed may not be enough. \nPaul Kershaw, a public policy professor at UBC and founder of think tank Generation Squeeze, argues that politicians have failed to address the elephant in the room: the wealth older homeowners have generated off the housing crisis.\n\"The political bargain has asked younger Canadians to suffer higher rents and mortgages in order to protect those higher home values,\" Kershaw notes.\n\"None of the parties are really naming that generational tension,\" he says, adding that politicians may privately feel there is a political risk in trying to stall the cost of housing, and thus, older Canadians' assets.\nProf Kershaw calls this a \"cultural problem\", and says that parties should also focus on reducing costs for younger people as a way to alleviate this generational burden.\nFixing the housing crisis, he argues, is just as integral as asserting sovereignty and prosperity in the face of threats posed by Trump's tariffs.\nThe \"dysfunction that has entered our housing market is disruptive to the well-being of the country\", he says. \nUntil a fix is found, the possibility of homeownership still looks bleak for many. \nMs Dovgal contends half-heartedly that, other than moving elsewhere, \"you have to win the lottery, or marry a multi-millionaire. These are kind of the options\".",

BBC World Service's World Football podcast has taken a closer look at the club's unique journey.\nOlympique Lyonnais: The Champions League trailblazers\nThe women's football investors 'ripping up blueprint' on club ownership\nIs this the future of the Women's Championship?\nAulas established OL Feminin in 2004\nFor more than 30 years, local businessman Aulas was Lyon.\nAfter becoming owner and president in 1987, following pleas from the city's mayor and F1 legend Alain Prost, he oversaw the men's club's transformation from a debt-ridden club languishing in the second tier to serial trophy-winners throughout the 2000s.\nDetermined to replicate that success in women's football, he launched OL Feminin in 2004 and, under his ownership, the club attracted top overseas players, championed French talent like Wendie Renard, and opened France's first mixed-gender academy.\nIt took three years to deliver silverware, winning the Premiere Ligue in 2006-07. The rest is history.\n\"This guy was ahead of his time,\" former Lyon defender Lucy Bronze told the BBC's World Service. \"To have someone that powerful say I want the women's team to do well, I want them to be the best, I want to give them everything.\n\"He was the first one [to invest in women's football], not just with his money but with physically being there and how much he cared about the team. He enjoyed it just as much as the girls. He celebrated just as hard as we did.\"\nBronze is one of a number of superstars in the women's game to have played for Lyon\nAulas' ownership ended in 2022 when Eagle Football became the majority shareholders of the OL Groupe, which encompassed both the men's and women's teams - as well as a majority stake in NWSL side Seattle Reign, and he resigned from his 36-year presidency the following year.\nIn 2023, the women's team changed hands again, with South Korea-born American businesswoman Kang, who made her fortune in healthcare IT, taking on majority ownership and making it a separate entity - \"independent\" - from the men's team.\n\"We have reached the end of our model a bit,\" chief executive Vincent Ponsot said. \"I think we needed a new lease of life, a new project. That is exactly what Michele brought with a much more global vision.\n\"We now see clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Barcelona. There is competition and our ambition is to remain one of the best European clubs. If Michele had not arrived, I think it would have been almost impossible because we need France to move much faster than it does today.\"\nKang also owns Washington Spirit and London City Lionesses\nDescribed by the Financial Times as \"arguably the first tycoon in women's football\", Kang is a relative latecomer to football.\nShe first became interested in the sport after meeting the World Cup-winning US women's team in 2019 and has since built up a portfolio of teams under her Kynisca Sports International group. In addition to Lyon, she has been the majority owner of NWSL team Washington Spirit since 2022 and purchased Women's Championship side London City Lionesses in 2023.\n\"I realised these are the best of the best athletes around the world,\" Kang said, reflecting on her meeting with the USWNT.\n\"I saw a significant lack of resources and attention. I saw the possibility of how women's football could explode with a little nudge and a little investment. \n\"I am not alone and there are a lot of people who share the same passion. Two billion people watch the World Cup - it's growing.\"\nKang's interest isn't limited to multi-club ownership, however, with a number of multi-million pound investments in women's sport, including a \u00a339m global investment in improving the health of elite female athletes.\nHer plans for Lyon are no less grand. Her long-term ambitions include the construction of a dedicated women's centre, with a 15-18,000-seater stadium and a bigger training facility, while she has already invested heavily in improving the club's backroom staff.\n\"The first thing she said to me was 'Vincent, what do you have to do for the OL women's team to have the same supervisions as the professional men's team?'. That was in August 2023,\" Ponsot said.\n\"I told her, 'we have to hire 11 people to the staff', and she said, 'go on then'. Two months later, we had 11 more people and 24 staff to improve the support to players so they can perform.\n\"The main thing we have evolved is in the performance sector. We have full-time nutritionists, physiotherapists, doctors, a performance manager, a psychologist. We have everything we need for the players to be in the best conditions to perform like the men's team.\"\nLyon midfielder and USA captain Lindsey Heaps added: \"[Michele] is incredible. I have never seen anything like this in the women's game, the sort of investment but also the way she speaks.\n\"When she took over she was a bit shocked that it was such a prestigious club and still [have] things that we need. Sometimes you can look at it and think 'they have Champions League trophies, they are winning every single game' [but] it's still not to the standard we need.\"\nLyon have attracted some 15,000-20,000 fans to Groupama Stadium for big Champions League games, but play most of their home matches at the 1,500-seater Gerard Houllier Stadium  \nAnother of Kang's priorities is increasing attendances at Lyon fixtures. \n\"If you ask many female players what is at the top of your wishlist, they don't say I want to get paid more, I want bigger cars. They say, 'I want to play against the best players and best teams in a sellout stadium'. It's my job that we fill the stadium,\" she said.\nLyon will travel to Emirates Stadium on Saturday (12:30 BST) for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final with Arsenal - a stadium where the Gunners recorded an average attendance of 52,029 across six matches last season.\n\"When you see that Arsenal are filling Emirates Stadium, there is no reason why we can't,\" said Ponsot. \"We realised that women's football has an audience with a strong increase in appetite, but we are having trouble making it a reality.\"\nLyon are on course for a record-extending 18th league title this season, having already booked their place in May's end-of-season play-offs. Indeed, they have only lost two league matches over the past four seasons.\nThat sustained success, coupled with Aulas' unmatched support, is seen by some as having had a negative impact on crowds, media interest, and investment in France.\nWomen's football journalist Assile Toufaily said: \"Some will say 'why should we come and watch football that isn't attractive because the level isn't that good?' We know OL are going to smash the other clubs 7-0. Fans aren't intrigued to come and watch.\n\"They say if you want to have a better level of football, investors have to invest. Investors will then say why should we invest if the media isn't promoting the game? So you find yourself in a vicious circle and it's been like this for years.\"\nBut she does not see Aulas' investment as the problem. \n\"If he didn't invest in 2004, maybe no-one would ever have done it in France. Aulas isn't to blame, but maybe the problem is others didn't follow along.\"\nKang, unsurprisingly, is undaunted by this, working with Ponsot to \"find the profile\" of women's football fans, with their own research indicating only a 5% overlap between fans who watch men's and women's matches.\nShe will likely find a powerful ally in Aulas, who was elected vice-president of the French Football Federation in December 2023 and has taken over responsibility for development of women's football. \n\"The French league is going to be very strong in years to come,\" vowed Aulas.\n\"If I acted badly before by being too strong [when I was] with Lyon, you can expect me to act badly [in my role] with France.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "Finland has topped the World Happiness Rankings for the eighth year running \u2013 but the real appeal for travellers lies in the country's deeply-lived values of balance, nature and everyday contentment.\nFinns tend to accept the accolade of supreme happiness, bestowed on them by the UN's World Happiness Report in March 2025 for the eighth time in a row, with a collective shrug and eye roll. But Finnish travel operators are celebrating as travellers increasingly make the connection between Finland and happiness, hoping to come and experience that Finnish brand of happiness for themselves.\nHowever, don't expect to be greeted with howls of laughter and cheerful quips when you land at Helsinki Airport or disembark from one of the Baltic ferries in the capital's harbour. There is some truth in the perception of Finland being a no-nonsense, down-to-earth kind of nation. Generally, Finns are flattered \u2013 happy, even \u2013 to be honoured by the report's conclusions, but while graciously accepting them, they feel \"happiness\" isn't really the right word. Instead, \"contentment\", \"fulfilment\" or \"life satisfaction\" are widely considered more appropriate terms. As Finnish President Alexander Stubb recently posted on Facebook: \"No one can be happy all the time, and sometimes circumstance makes it difficult. But getting the basics right \u2013 security, freedom and equality \u2013 is a good start.\"\nBut while the concept of happiness in Finland may be nuanced and culturally specific, it is deeply embedded in the fabric of daily life. Rather than seeking constant highs, the Finnish approach is rooted in balance, connection and quiet contentment \u2013 qualities that increasingly resonate with visitors. And for travellers, this state of being is not just something to observe but one to get involved with first-hand, through embracing the country's nature, sauna culture, food, sustainable design and lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We see Finnish happiness as a summary of these five elements,\" says Teemu Ahola, director of international operations at Visit Finland, \"but we don't measure or collect data to evaluate happiness as a single attraction in itself\".\nTo experience these tangible, authentic aspects of Finnish life that underpin its consistent happiness ranking, Ahola suggests Finnish sauna culture as an increasingly popular, most globally identifiable attraction; and stresses that Finland is a safe country, naming the risk of bumping into free-roaming reindeer in northern Lapland as one of the few potential hazards for visiting tourists. Meanwhile, he adds, a new and confident generation of Finnish chefs has earned international respect for and interest in the Finnish culinary scene.\n2025's Happiest Countries\nThe 2025 top 10 happiest countries, in descending order, consist of Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Norway, Israel, Luxembourg and Mexico. The Report's findings are based on Gallup poll scores for inequality (or absence thereof), social support, GDP per capita, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, perceptions of corruption, positive emotions, and willingness to donate and volunteer. \"Caring and Sharing\" were chosen as general themes for the 2025 report, timely reminders of the societal virtues of empathy and community.\u00a0\nFinland is home to the world's northernmost Michelin star restaurant, Tapio, in Ruka-Kuusamo; and the Saimaa Lakeland region was named a European Region of Gastronomy in 2024. Many restaurants across Helsinki celebrate the edible riches \u2013 mushrooms, berries, fish and game \u2013 that are accessible to all in the country's endless forests, coastal archipelagos and inland waterways through Finland's Jokaisenoikeudet\u00a0or \"Everyman's Right\", a law that grants everyone the freedom to roam and forage.\nHelsinki, where most visitors start or end their trip, offers a first-hand glimpse of this national contentment. This is a seaside city, spread over a beautiful natural archipelago and reclaimed land. It's easy to grab a city bike from one of the dozens of stands around town and head off to explore the coast-hugging cycling routes or disappear into Central Park, a belt of forest that stretches from the city centre to its northern periphery.\nThe endorphin boost experienced by this kind of freewheeling adventure and access to plentiful natural resources ties directly into the UN's happiness metrics of life expectancy, freedom and positive emotions. This connection can be found at the heart of SaimaaLife, a nature and wellness company in eastern Finland's sprawling Saimaa Lakeland region, run by mental health expert and guide Mari Ahonen.\nAhonen is an enthusiastic advocate of the mental balance that Finnish nature and lifestyle have to offer and leads her guests through shinrin-yoku (forest bathing), traditional lakeside saunas, wild swimming, foraging trips for mushrooms and berries and cooking over an open fire.\n\"We Finns can be too modest,\" she says. \"We should notice the World Happiness status in a positive way. I'm a living example of having been able to develop a business with the support that has been available for my entrepreneurship. Some people say it's a lottery win to be born in Finland.\"\u00a0\nA lottery win, that is, in the form of life satisfaction and balance; of living comfortably and having \"enough\" in a material sense. This ceiling of expectation shouldn't be confused with a lack of ambition or resourcefulness. After all, this is the birthplace of mobile communications pioneer Nokia, the distinctive garden tool and scissor brand Fiskars and textile and clothing icon Marimekko.\u00a0\nFinland isn't immune from economic pressure or controversies, however, and the long, dark winters can put a strain on mental health. The Finnish idea of happiness also includes a dose of sisu: a hard-to-translate concept of resilience, fortitude, courage and grit. Finnish-Canadian author Katja Pantzar, who has written extensively about this perceived national quality, explains that it's \"a mindset that allows people and communities to work together in the face of challenges rather than give up or blame and attack others\".\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n\u2022 The European region where young people are happiest\n\u2022 Turku: Finland's under-the-radar Nordic destination\nShe notes that the top four nations in the World Happiness Report are all Nordic countries with strong welfare systems designed to support the collective good. \"Happiness is very culturally specific,\" she said. \"In Finland, there are many examples of everyday happiness that are available and accessible to everyone, whether it's nature \u2013 every person in Finland is on average about 200m from the nearest forest, park, seashore or natural body of water \u2013 saunas, public libraries, safe and efficient public transport, free clean drinking water, education or healthcare.\"\nPantzar also highlights the mood-boosting properties of contrast therapy \u2013 hot saunas followed by cold dips \u2013 as an accessible, every-day mood booster. \"It's incredibly easy to do in Helsinki, surrounded by the sea,\" she says. \"When you don't need to travel great distances or pay large fees to have a quick dip, it's easier to do more regularly, before or after work or on your lunch break.\"\u00a0\nAnd while some Finns remain sceptical of the \"happiest nation\" label, most seem to appreciate what they have. \"I don't find it easy to think of Finland as the happiest country in the world,\" says pensioner Juha Roiha. \"In poorer countries like Thailand and Nepal, people seem relaxed in spite of any hardship. In Finland, you might sometimes hear people say that they'd be happier somewhere else. But within ourselves, with what we have, we're happy.\"\nHappy Land - Finding the Inner Finn, a travel memoir by Tim Bird, will be published by Eye Books in the UK in January 2026.

Fees on Chinese-built ships will start at $18 a ton or $120 per container and also rise over the next three years.\nNon-US built ships carrying cars will be charged $150 per vehicle.\nThe fee will be applied once per voyage on affected ships and not more than five times a year.\nThe USTR also decided not to impose fees based on how many Chinese-built ships are in a fleet or based on prospective orders of Chinese ships, as it had originally proposed.\nEmpty vessels that arrive at US ports to carry bulk exports like coal or grain are exempted.\nVessels that move goods between American ports as well as from those ports to Caribbean islands and US territories are also exempted from rules, as are US and Canadian ships that call at ports in the Great Lakes.\nThe fees are much lower than a plan floated in February to charge up to $1.5m (\u00a31.1m) for each American port a Chinese ship visits.\nThe USTR said a second phase of actions will begin in three years to favour US-built ships carrying liquified natural gas (LNG). These restrictions will rise incrementally over the following 22 years.\nThe announcement came as global trade is already being disrupted by Trump's trade tariffs, experts have said.\nCargoes originally destined for ports in the US from China are instead being redirected to European ports, a trade group said.\nBusinesses have warned this will raise prices for US consumers.\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nThese tariffs have caused \"significant build ups\" of ships, especially in the European Union, but also \"significant congestion\" at UK ports, according to Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade.\nMore containers are coming to the UK, he said.\n\"We've seen a lot of diversion of ships from China, that were due to head to the US, diverting and coming to the UK and into the EU.\"\nIn the first three months of 2025, Chinese imports into the UK have increased by about 15% and into the EU by about 12%.\n\"That's a direct impact of what President Trump is doing,\" he said, adding that uncertainty and increased disruption pushes up prices for consumers.\nSanne Manders, president of logistics firm Flexport, said both tariffs and strikes at ports in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in the first three months of the year had been \"clogging\" ports.\nCongestion in the UK \"is particularly severe in Felixstowe\", while in continental Europe Rotterdam and Barcelona are \"also pretty severe\".\n\"I do believe that if more cargo is going to be routed towards Europe, finding new buyers that will drive up the volumes even further, that could lead to more congestion,\" he said - although terminals would be open for more hours per day in the summer due to better weather.\nHe said shippers were looking for new markets, but that also there may be a surge of goods to the US to try to take advantage of that 90-day window for goods from some countries.\nHe said in the US, consumers would pay for the tariffs, but European consumers would not see \"much impact\".\nCompanies would also probably start redesigning their supply chains, he said.",

Safulu lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident but still competes, becoming the first bodybuilder with a disability in Uganda to compete against able-bodied athletes.\nIn Livingstone, Zambia, failed rainy seasons and expanding human settlements have fuelled a sharp rise in human-elephant conflict. In 2024 alone, elephants killed at least 11 people in the area. \nA local volunteer group is now working to protect both communities and wildlife.\nIn 2017, photographer Cinzia Canneri began documenting the lives of Eritrean women escaping authoritarian rule. \nSince the war in Ethiopia's Tigray region erupted, her focus has widened to include Tigrayan women fleeing violence. \nBoth groups have faced brutal attacks, including rape, torture, and shootings. Zayid, 23 (not her real name - pictured) was raped in a refugee camp in Amhara. \nWhile fleeing with her family to Addis Ababa, she and her sister were shot and wounded by Amhara soldiers.\nSince the 1950s, around 200,000 Korean children have been adopted into the United States. \nAn Associated Press investigation has revealed widespread fraud in adoption documents, leaving many adoptees with false or incomplete histories. \nFor individuals like Nicole, who is pictured, the search for identity has uncovered painful truths about their past.\nMyanmar, formerly Burma, has faced decades of unrest and conflict since gaining independence, with ongoing struggles for ethnic and regional autonomy. \nYe Aung Thu, who witnessed the 1988 military coup at the age of six, saw history repeat itself in 2021 when his own son was the same age. \nHe has since travelled across the country, documenting insurgent groups and capturing how their resilience offers hope amid turmoil.\nThe Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe people of the Te Urewera region in New Zealand have maintained a staunch independence. With a 2014 agreement, the New Zealand government opened the way to T\u016bhoe managing their ancestral lands according to their cultural values.\nRecent changes by New Zealand's right-wing government are seen as reversals of such policies regarding indigenous peoples. Yet the Tataiwhetu Trust farm in Te Urewera offers a revitalising model for a younger generation.\nOngoing conflict in their home village near Kupiansk, a frontline city in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, forced Anhelina's family to seek refuge. \nShe now lives with her grandmother, Larisa, in Borshchivka, 95km from Kupiansk, while her mother lives and works in Kharkiv, about an hour's journey away. \nAna Maria Jeremias has spent over four decades working as a carer and domestic worker in Portugal, reflecting the experience of many women across Europe.\nTrafficked from Angola at the age of nine under the false promise of an education, she has since played a vital, often overlooked, role in the lives of the families she has served.\nKardash, a Russian-born photographer now living in Germany, reflects on the loss of home and the pain of loving those who see the world differently. \nReturning to her hometown, she seeks to capture how war reshapes lives, while holding on to the hope that human connection can endure even amid deep divisions.\nThe assassination attempt on Donald Trump is widely seen as a pivotal moment in the 2024 presidential campaign, with lasting implications for the political future of the United States. \nMoments after the shooting, the Republican nominee shouted \"Fight, fight, fight!\" as he was led from the stage. \nCaptured seconds later, this image offers a rare glimpse of vulnerability in a campaign centred on strength and resilience.\nFarshi's project examines how people confront death in a setting shaped by compassion and choice. \nIn a quiet residential neighbourhood in Washington state, where assisted dying is legal in certain circumstances, a house offers the terminally ill a place to spend their final hours, surrounded by care and community.\nHere, with support and dignity, some choose to end their lives by taking prescribed medication, highlighting the deeply personal, and often tender, process of dying.\nIn 2022, El Salvador declared a \"state of emergency\" to combat gang violence, restricting rights like assembly and privacy. \nRenewed 35 times by March 2025, it has led to mass incarceration and overcrowded prisons, where reports of abuse and neglect are common. \nThis project focuses on the personal stories behind these policies, revealing the human toll of the crackdown.\nBetween April and June 2024, record-breaking rainfall in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, led to the worst flood in the area's history.\nThe Ember\u00e1 Dobida, a nomadic indigenous group from Colombia, have migrated to Bogot\u00e1 to escape paramilitary violence but face discrimination in the capital.\nSuicides in the community have risen sharply, from 15 between 2015 and 2020 to 67 suicides and over 400 attempts by 2024. \nThis project highlights the lives of Ember\u00e1 women affected by the crisis, shedding light on their struggles.\nThis project follows the dangerous journeys of migrants crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a 100-kilometre stretch of dense jungle between Colombia and Panama. \nTheir paths are fraught with peril, from treacherous rivers and harsh terrain to the constant threat of violence and exploitation.\nCross-border attacks between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, which had been ongoing since the start of the Gaza conflict, intensified sharply in September 2024.\nBeirut, once a safe haven for those fleeing airstrikes in southern Lebanon, itself came under fire as the violence spread northwards.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban government denies access to education to girls over 12, bars them from most work outside the home and in some regions, forbids them from leaving home without a male guardian, or with their face uncovered. \nThe spaces where women once gathered freely are now off limits. Despite these restrictions, Afghan women find subtle but powerful ways to resist. \nKolbars (border couriers) carry goods, such as household appliances, mobile phones, and clothes, on their backs through treacherous terrain from Iraq and Turkey into Iranian Kurdistan. \nDecades-long marginalisation of Kurds means widespread unemployment in the region, driving many to a life of kolbari, where they risk being shot by security forces and border patrols.\nAll photographs courtesy World Press Photo Foundation\nThe World Press Photo Exhibition 2025 will take place at MPB Gallery, Here East, London from 23rd May \u2013 25th August 2025",

        "article_text": "She jets around the world for her high-profile beauty career, but her heart is in Seoul. Here are her top K-beauty experiences in town, from face lasers to body scrubs.\nFor Chriselle Lim \u2013 style guru, digital creator and creative director of PHLUR fragrances \u2013 self-care is a way of life. Especially when she visits South Korea, the birthplace of the viral \"K-beauty\"\u2013 \u00a0beloved for its multi-layer \"glass skin\" skincare regimens and high-tech sun creams.\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Chriselle Lim)\nChriselle Lim is a Korean American fashion stylist, entrepreneur and digital influencer. She founded the fashion and lifestyle blog The Chriselle Factor in 2011, leading to collaborations with luxury brands including Dior and Chanel.\n\"Beauty and self-care in Korea is a daily thing,\" says the fresh-faced and flawlessly stylish Lim, who spent her formative years in the glamorous South Korean capital and returns with her daughters each year. \"It's not about hitting a certain age and then taking care of your skin. You just do it since you're a very young girl. As we're trying to reverse [sun damage] here in the States, in Korea, the women have been taught to protect themselves early on. We were always embarrassed about our moms taking us around in their crazy massive sun hats and their gloves. But now I get it. I've become that lady.\"\nWhile innovative Korean products like collagen sheet masks continue to dominate the international market, Korea is also seeing an uptick in beauty tourism. Consumers can visit \"skin clinics\" for medical aesthetic treatments powered by ultra-modern Korean technologies; often not yet approved by the FDA. Adding to the appeal, patients can get several treatments \u2013 from Botox to Titanium skin lifting to liquid laser sun spot removal \u2013 in one sitting with jaw-dropping transformations and little downtime \u2013 compared to Western protocols, which require patients wait 28 days between treatments.\u00a0\n\"I have a lot of followers that ask me for tips and where to go,\" says Lim. \"It makes a lot of sense. One, the technology is there. And two, it's so much cheaper [than the US], at least by five times. The flight there, renting an Airbnb or a hotel; it actually makes a lot of sense because you are saving money in the long run.\"\nNot that Lim ever needs a reason to visit Seoul. \"It's a fast-paced city that is extremely clean, chic, sophisticated,\" she says. \"Just imagine fashion and art and beauty all combined in one. It's one of those places I go whenever I'm feeling like I need inspiration.\"\nHere is Lim's go-to plan for a self-care holiday in Seoul.\nGangnam, the stylish district made world-famous by a certain 2012 K-pop song, is considered Seoul's K-beauty and medical tourism hot spot\u00a0 \u2013 and it's where Lim's self-care holidays start. First stop: Eun Skin Clinic in the affluent Cheongdam neighbourhood, south of the Han River.\nTip:\n\"A tip that people don't realise when planning is that you have to see what side of the river [Han] these places are and try to plan accordingly,\" says Lim. \"Because crossing that river can take so long; traffic is really bad, so you have to figure out the subway system or try to plan everything out in advance.\"\n\"They do incredible lasers, the best I've experienced,\" says Lim. \"They speak really good English there, which is a big make or break for me because I'm not fluent in Korean. And because [the doctor] deals with a lot of English-speaking people, I think she realises that a lot of them are here to explore and have fun, so she doesn't want to be so aggressive with their face. They do a very customised approach.\"\nKorean skin lasers, notes Lim, are so gentle they can even be layered on top of each other to compound their transformative effects.\u00a0\n\"It's very, very gentle,\" says Lim of her most recent visit. \"I did something called Ruby toning; helps with even skin tone and brightening. And there's another laser that I did called MeDioStar\u00ae, which is brightening and tightening. And then on top of that, I did PRP [platelet-rich plasma treatment]. And then I also did microneedling and then salmon DNA. It takes maybe an hour and a half to do.\"\nShe cautions:\u00a0 \"The next day, if you get five to eight treatments, your skin will be slightly bruised, but it goes away within, I would say, 48 hours. [These lasers are] effective on the deeper surface level, but on the topical level, you can't really tell that you've gotten anything done\u2026 But then after I went home, and people were like, 'Wait, did you, did you do something to your face? ' And you're like, 'Okay, I think it's kicking in'.\"\nLim recommends visitors hit skin clinics at the beginning of their trip \u2013 \"first thing when they land\u2026 because these clinics like to check up on you after three-to-five days. During that downtime, you could do coffee and check out some incredible museums and do some shopping.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.eunskin.co.kr/\nAddress: 88-37 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +\n82 2 546 3322\nInstagram: @eunskinclinic/\nAs part of her downtime from skin procedures, Lim also likes to indulge in relaxing body treatments.\nTip:\nAs exciting as high tech and holistic body treatments may be, the traditional Korean spa experience happens at the jjimjilbang; the public bathhouse. \"Bathhouses in Korea are really interesting,\" says Lim. \"People go there to meet their friends, hang out and eat. They even go there after hours, after the club to detox the alcohol and sweat it out. It's fascinating; they don't really go there for the experience; it's to hang out with their friends.\"\n\"There's this spa called Gogyeol,\" says Lim. \"I love this place to reset my body. They do a traditional Korean massage and scrub.\"\nLike Eun Skin Clinic, Spa Gogyeol is found in Cheongdam; a two-minute walk from the Gangnam-Gu Office metro station. Lim notes that Spa Gogyeol is a not a jjimjilbang (a public Korean bathhouse). \"A lot of people love Korean bathhouses [because] they do this intensive scrub where they literally scrub off all the dead cells off your skin and it just comes purging off your body. It's pretty disgusting. But [Spa Gogyeol does] that treatment in a private setting, so you can get the body scrub, the upgrade massage and a detox wrap. They literally scrub off every dead skin cell on your body, and it just feels so soft. You feel like you're floating.\"\nSpa Gogyeol also offers a rich menu of holistic medical treatments, working with the body's five Tae energies. \"In Korean health, a lot of it is about balance,\" says Lim. \"So they'll really analyse your body to see what they need to focus on, and they'll customise it for you.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of people that are on holiday just want to relax,\" she adds. \"A lot of tired mamas.

There's so much to see in Korea, but even a three-day trip is worth it, just because, again, that the value that you're getting for these treatments are you getting the bang for your buck.\"\n\"It's a little tricky with Trinity spa because their English isn't the best,\" says Lim. \"But I think they're working on it. They're more of a general spa; that's why I feel okay recommending it. They do everything from amazing facials, really focussing on lifting the face and focussing on your lines, and brightening and tightening to body contouring, massages. They cover it all.\"\nTrinity Spa's array of facial and body treatments toe the line between technology and relief \u2013 like the Real Jade Stone V-line jaw contour treatment or the lymphatic drainage leg massages \u2013 all administered in private guest rooms with cushy spa beds designed for ultimate relaxation.\u00a0\n\"It's just a very relaxing experience for someone that wants a general spa experience,\" says Lim.\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.trinityspa.co.kr/\nAddress: 3rd floor, Taeseok Building 116 Dokseodang-ro, Hannam-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-420-0797\nInstagram: \n@the_trinityspa_official/\nThe Korean skincare craze began in the early 2010s; global cosmetic purveyor Sephora's website now features a K-beauty section and Lim herself often provides K-beauty product recommendations on social media.\nSo when in Korea, shop as the Koreans do.\n\"Everyone needs to go to Amorepacific World Headquarters,\" declares Lim. Known as the inventor of the cushion foundation, Amorepacific now also owns many popular Korean skincare companies including Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Cosrx and Laneige. \"It's open to the public, which a lot of people don't know,\" says Lim. \"In their lobby, you can get your face scanned; a lot of people go there to get their cushion foundation customised\u2026 they have a beauty store in their lobby, so you can experience all of their brands at once. [There's also] an interactive Amorepacific store called AMORE Seongsu. It's in this warehouse-y cement building; it's like you're walking through a store, but with a bathroom installation in front of you while you try things. Everything is technology-driven; you can get customised lip treatments, customised foundation. I could spend hours there.\"\u00a0\nLim adds: \"There's also the Sulwhasoo flagship store, which is just beautiful in itself.\"\nSulwhasoo, a luxury skin line, is headquartered in Seoul's upscale shopping district Sinsa-dong, in a modular structure channelling a golden lantern. \"The shopping is great, and it looks like you're entering an installation,\" says Lim. \"It has two spas. You could have, like, a foot scrub [or] a therapist with the singing bowl around your abdomen.\"\nLim also enjoys shopping for her favourite Korean brands at Olive Young. \"It's the Sephora of Korea,\" she says. \"They're on every corner. But the key thing is to know which one to go to. There's one in Myeongdong, which is the largest. Then the newest one is in Seongsu and it's a lot more tech-driven.\" Apart from beauty shopping, the five-storey Olive Young in Seongsu houses a cafe and a skin and scalp clinic as well as professional makeup services and a \"trend pod\" showroom. \"Olive Young can be slightly outdated depending which one you go to,\" says Lim. \"But this one feels like the future of what Olive Young will be.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.apgroup.com/int/en/our-culture/amorepacific-space/amorepacific-headquarters/amorepacific-headquarters.html (Amorepacific World Headquarters)\nAddress: 100 Hangang-daero, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-604-05114\nInstagram: \n@amorepacificgroup.official/\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.amoremall.com/kr/ko/store/display?storeCode=001 (Amorepacific Seongsu)\nAddress: 7 Achasan-ro 11-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-469-8600\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.sulwhasoo.com/int/en/flagship/dosan/index.html (Sulwhasoo flagship)\nAddress: 18 Dosan-daero 45-gil, Sinsa-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2-541-9270\nInstagram: \n@sulwhasoo.official/\nWebsite: \nhttps://global.oliveyoung.com/ (Olive Young Seongsu)\nAddress: 300-65 Seongsu-dong 2(i)-ga, Seongdong-gu, SeoulPhone:  +82 2-461-5290\nInstagram: @oliveyoung_global/\nTo cap off a day of beauty, Lim heads straight for the hair salon. \"This is actually quite common in Korea,\" she says. \"After you get all your skin treatments, you go get your hair done.\"\nLim favours ABYBOM, a massive, three-storey salon on Seolleung-ro that boasts a client roster of Korean celebs like Sandara Park. \"A lot of people that go to events get the full service of hair and makeup done,\" says Lim. \"They do amazing cuts. They style, they detoxify your scalp, if needed. They're incredible.\"\u00a0\nAfterwards, Lim always likes to visit a caf\u00e9. \"Caf\u00e9 life in Korea is so major,\" she says. \"Between caf\u00e9s and skin, you will never see the end of day.\" One of her favourite stops is inside the Dosan Park Gentle Monster branch; 35 minutes outside of Seoul proper. \"Gentle Monster is a sunglass brand; they have the coolest shops ever,\" says Lim. \"It's like an art installation. Then downstairs, there is a cafe called Nudake; they have conceptual coffees and baked goods.\"\nNudake Caf\u00e9 proffers its coffees and whimsical pastries on stark countertops, like modern art displays. \"It sounds so ridiculous, but they have these tiny, tiny, tiny, miniature croissants,\" says Lim. \"They're literally the size of your pinky nail bed, but it's so good, and it's just so fun to take a photo with. [And] they have incredible coffee. It's actually quite hard to find non-dairy milks, but they have non-dairy milk there. So that's personally the reason why I like to go to that caf\u00e9, to just get my lattes without dairy milk.\"\u00a0\n\"There's a lot of things that we have been doing in Korea that I feel like the world is finally noticing,\" adds Lim. \"It's something that I'm very proud of.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.abybom.com/\nAddress: 3\n\uce35\n, 40 Seolleung-ro 152-gil, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: + 82-2-516-8765\nInstagram: \n@abybom__official/reels/ \nWebsite: \nhttps://nudake.com/en\nAddress: 26 Seongsui-ro 7-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-7-041-284408\nInstagram: \n@nu_dake/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "It may be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but Tony Gilroy's Star Wars series takes a key plot from a real robbery masterminded by Stalin in an Imperial Russian city. And Andor has as much to do with our world as it has with Stalin's.\nIt has all the makings of the perfect heist.\nThe scheme takes place far from the imperial seat of power, on the wild fringes of an empire almost too vast to comprehend. Fuelled with revolutionary zeal, the plotters are a rag-tag outfit of men and women that includes thieves, murderers and turncoats. Their prize? A treasure chest of cash that can fund ever-more-ambitious missions against the hated ruling elite.\nIf you watched the first season of the Star Wars spin-off TV series Andor, you'll recognise this plot as one of the high points. Over three episodes, anti-hero Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his band of accomplices hide out in mountain passes on the planet Aldhani, fine-tuning an audacious smash-and-grab from an Imperial garrison which is storing the wages of an entire sector.\u00a0\nThe real-life theft that inspired it was also a long, long time ago, just not quite so far away.\nIt took place in Yerevan Square in what was then the imperial Russian city of Tiflis, now the Georgian capital Tblisi, on 26 June 1907. A shipment of cash for the city's Russian state bank branch, amounting to some 300,000 roubles ($1m at the time), was stolen by a gang of robbers linked to the Bolshevik revolutionary movement. Using bombs and guns, the gang left a scene of utter devastation in their wake; some 40 people were killed and dozens more injured. The news of the brazen daylight attack made headlines across the world.\nThe heist was the brainchild of a charismatic cobbler's son-turned-revolutionary called Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. He was a gifted public speaker, an ex-seminary student, a romantic poet rumoured to have left a string of broken hearts in his rakish wake. He often went by the name \"Soso\" (which he had used when writing poems for local publications), though in years to come he would become far better-known \u2013 and feared \u2013 as Joseph Stalin.\u00a0\nYes, the troubled outlaw beloved by Star Wars fans everywhere is based in part on one of history\u2019s most notorious mass murderers, as the series' creator, Tony Gilroy, has acknowledged. \"If you look at a picture of young Stalin, isn\u2019t he glamorous,\" Gilroy said in an interview in\u00a0Rolling Stone in 2022. \"He looks like Diego!\"\nStalin took Russia from its war-ravaged imperial decline to a nuclear-armed superpower in just three decades, but also presided over a reign of authoritarian terror that starved, executed or imprisoned millions of its own citizens. Countless books had been written on his cruel years in power, but very little on his early years. Writer Simon Sebag Montefiore saw a gap, and began rifling through archives in post-Soviet countries to try and separate the truth from myth, and tell the little-known story of Stalin's early life.\nIn 2007 \u2013 a century after the infamous heist in Tiflis \u2013 Young Stalin was published. It delved into the early life of the Soviet Union's dictatorial leader. \"Should the life of a black-hearted ogre, a mass murderer who was the wickedest of the 20th-Century's monsters, be quite so entertaining,\" asked a review in The Observer at the time.\nOne person who read Young Stalin was Gilroy. The writer and producer, who had scripted the first four Bourne films and the Andor-precursor film, Rogue One, was planning a TV series that would explore Cassian Andor's journey from casual thief to rebellious figurehead. The true story of a revolutionary movement on the far fringes of a real empire gave Gilroy his source material. \"Literally, I\u2019m the classic old white guy who just can\u2019t get enough history,\" Gilroy said in Rolling Stone. \"The last 15 years, I\u2019ve been reading all non-fiction.\" He added that Young Stalin was \"an amazing book\" and that its account of the Tiflis bank robbery was an \"incredible movie sequence\".\nDid Sebag Montefiore ever think to himself, 'Here's the perfect setting for a Star Wars spin-off,' when he was researching his book? \"No, I didn't ever think that when I was toiling in the archives in Moscow and Tbilisi,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I did think that there was something pretty elemental about the life of Stalin, especially before 1917. It was a fascinating story, partly because no one knew about it.\"\nThe Tiflis heist was reported around the world and funded the revolutionaries' movement for years, says Sebag Montefiore. \"Lenin and the whole Bolshevik Party lived off that money until the [1917] revolution.\"\nSebag Montefiore says that the young Stalin and the troubled Andor bear striking similarities: \"A young man from nowhere with a revolutionary ideology, and a fight against a huge empire,\" the writer says. \"I did think there was something interesting about the secret life of someone in that situation. That's basically what Tony Gilroy has focused on in Andor.\"\nStalin was, of course, not the only figure fomenting turmoil in Tsarist Russia, and Andor fleshes out other characters with attributes from the young Georgian's contemporaries. Among Andor's co-conspirators in the Aldanhi heist is Karis Nemik (Alex Lawther), an idealist writing a high-minded manifesto for the emerging resistance, similar to Bolshevik Leon Trotsky's polemics amid the opulent decline of Romanov rule.\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, Luthen Rael, is an analogue for Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader who was able to form a powerful movement from unlikely bedfellows. A wealthy art collector, Luthen's precise manners in front of his gilded customers hide an uncompromising hatred of the empire and a restless desire to fund a growing resistance. In Cassian's talented, taciturn thief he sees a useful tool; Lenin saw the same in Stalin. \"In 1911, people said to Lenin, 'Why are you using this guy? He's a gangster. He's had people killed. He was involved in all these bank robberies,'\" says Sebag Montefiore. \"And Lenin replies, 'He's exactly the type we need.' Stalin could edit a paper. He could write and could read. And he was also someone who could arrange a hit on somebody and arrange a bank robbery. That was what Lenin talked about: some people were tea drinkers, and other people were thugs, Stalin could do both, and that's why Stalin won in the end.\"\u00a0\nThe research into historical rebellions \u2013 Gilroy has said he studied other revolutions while writing Andor, as well \u2013 has no doubt helped create the show's oddly realistic feel. Andor feels more down to earth than anything the Star Wars universe has shown us before, if you'll excuse the occasional spaceship roaring overhead, or an alien or two sitting in the local bar. There are flashes of mundane detail rarely scene in big-budget sci-fi. People complain that Andor's mother Maarva's (Fiona Shaw) house is always too cold. Security officer Syril Karn's (Kyle Soller) petulant intensity even extends to tailoring his uniform to make him look smarter than his contemporaries. The Imperial Security Bureau hoping to root out the emerging rebellion is a nest of competing ambitions that feels as real as anything in a historical drama \u2013 or in everyday office politik. There are fewer blaster-toting Stormtroopers than there are in the Star Wars films, and more sadistic, trenchcoated officers who would have been right at home in the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, or its Soviet replacement, the Cheka.\n\"In the past, Star Wars movies drop us in at a very big moment,\" says Walter Marsh, an Australian writer who praised Andor's grown-up worldview in The Guardian in 2022. \"There's the big climactic battle, or Luke Skywalker's heroic journey, and they're these big themes of good versus evil. But as any historian will tell you, wars and empires and revolutions don't start and end overnight, and there's always this bigger backstory. There's this sort of long tail. It takes years for that kind of colonial rot, those systems of control, to set in.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Japanese film that Star Wars stole from\n\u2022 The truth about Henry VIII's right-hand man\n\u2022 Black Mirror's most 'devastating' episode ever\nAndor shows the corruption and brutal entitlement found at every layer of autocratic regimes: the guards drinking in a brothel while they're supposed to be on duty (and prepared to shake down anyone they don't like the look of); the prison industrial system that requires constant additions even if the new prisoners have done nothing wrong; the subtle sabotage of ethnic pilgrimages to sacred land that is earmarked for imperial development. And with authoritarianism on the rise around the globe, Andor has as much to say about today's world as it does about Stalin's.\u00a0\n\"When the show came out I think I was pleasantly surprised to see a story in that universe that was familiar, but which also approached this question of empire that's been so central to the whole franchise, but was never actually tackled in a really nuanced and human character-driven way,\" Marsh tells the BBC. \"It's all well and good to have a big, evil Sith Lord achieve global, universal domination. But how does power assert itself on the street level, from one human to another?\n\"The Empire is this huge grinding, unthinking machine, but it's also a very human thing,\" Marsh continues. \"Who are the people that find a place and thrive in those systems?\" He remarks that in the original films the Imperials were little more than blank-and-you-miss-them pantomime villains: \"British guys in suits getting choked by Darth Vader at some point, who are just fiddling with buttons in the background.\"\nAndor's strength is its \"three-episode arcs that showed us the kind of death by a thousand cuts that it takes to achieve this sort of social, political and economic dominance\", says Marsh. \"The converse of that is it shows all the ways in which that kind of oppression inspires pushback and resistance in all kinds of different ways.\"\nThe new season, which begins on Tuesday 22 April, will develop the rebellion's story as it rushes towards the events seen in Rogue One: the scenes of brutal Imperial reactions to a demonstration shown in the trailer evoke the Tsarist crackdown on a St Petersburg march in 1905, which was a\u00a0 slow-burning contributor to the Bolshevik revolution.\n\"The scavenger who becomes a passionate revolutionary leader is kind of fascinating,\" says Sebag Montefiore of the troubled Cassian Andor. \"That's a great trajectory, because that's exactly what Stalin did. And it'll be interesting to see how deep Gilroy uses that \u2013 how far he goes to create a character with both heroic and villainous features.\"\nGeorge Lucas's original film trilogy rooted the rebellion in the classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys dynamic of countless Saturday matinee cliffhangers, the resistance modelled after anti-Nazi opposition in occupied Europe. The rebels of Andor inhabit a much more compromised reality; like real-life revolutionary movements, they are much more complicated than the ones we usually see on screen. Luthen, Andor's Lenin proxy, considers it with chilling deliberation in one of the first season's standout scenes: \"I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I\u2019ll never see.\"\nAs Sebag Montefiore notes, the revolutionaries themselves knew deep down that if they took power, they themselves would have to use repression as a tool; they would become what they once despised. \"Lenin himself said: 'A revolution without firing squads is meaningless.'\"\u00a0\nAndor season two is available on Disney+ from 22 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "On the morning of 8 December 2024, I waited anxiously at the Lebanese border, hoping to get into Syria as soon as the crossing opened, not knowing what to expect.\nBashar al-Assad, the president of 24 years, was gone. Opposition fighters had advanced towards Damascus, taking major cities including Aleppo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing: Syria was free.\nLike many Syrians, I'd only ever known the country under the rule of Assad and his father Hafez, who had been in power from 1971 until 2000. Life under the Assads had meant more than 50 years of disappearances, incarceration - and the civil war that began in 2011 had claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Syrians.\nI'd been detained at the start of the uprising that year, and several times afterwards; I witnessed men lined up to be beaten and heard screams of torture. Even after I left the country in 2013, I learnt that security forces had broken into my apartment in Damascus and vandalised it.\nI assumed I'd lost my home country for good, then suddenly last year the dictatorship was toppled in just over a week. As I crossed the border into the country without fear of arrest, and watched rebel fighters shoot celebratory gunfire, while people rejoiced on the streets, I felt like laughing and crying at once.\nFor weeks, Damascus's main Umayyad Square became a hub of celebrations. Young and old talked freely about politics and everywhere Syria's future was debated openly; among street vendors and taxi drivers, boys cleaning shoes. All of this was unthinkable under Assad, as Syrians could never protest freely for fear of reprisals.\nOnly now, four months on, the situation is more complex. Though great strides have been made in gaining some social freedoms, there are growing concerns around what democracy will look like but also around the role of Islam in the new regime.\nSo, how long might these social freedoms remain \u2013 or could, as some fear, the newly won liberties be short-lived?\nAt Rawda Caf\u00e9 in central Damascus, just across the road from Parliament, intellectuals gather around long tables to smoke shisha and discuss culture. Under Assad, political activists were picked up and arrested there. Rumour had it that some waiters were regime informants.\nToday, it's a very different picture. The caf\u00e9 hosts talks and music plays. Prominent figures who once fled the country have returned too \u2013 many are greeted by a band playing traditional songs with a giant drum.\nSyrian journalist Mohammad Ghannam is one of them. He tells me that he spent months in prisons during Assad's regime and later moved to France; his euphoria at returning is palpable.\n\"I think everyone who can come back, should come back to rebuild the country,\" he declares. \"There is a window to do whatever you want now compared with before 8 December 2024.\"\nReflecting on the past, he adds: \"Even preachers in the mosques needed to get approval and know what they were going to preach. [Now] it's completely free. [At] Friday prayers the Imam was talking about how your personal freedom shouldn't step on other people's freedom.\"\nOdai al-Zobi has also recently returned to Syria after 14 years  \u2013 he left to study but says he was unable to come back before now because he was outspoken about the regime.\n\"My books were banned here,\" he tells me. \"Now there is no censorship, you can read whatever you want. I was very surprised that a lot of people want to read and want to know more.\"\n\"This is a big change,\" agrees Ali al-Atassi, a Syrian documentary-maker and son of former Syrian President Noureddine al-Atassi. (His father was deposed in a coup by Hafez al-Assad.)\n\"It changed the rules of the game, and opened a lot of perspectives for the country.\"\nSyria's vibrant arts and culture scene has long been a source of the country's pride: the Assads supported it, wanting to present a rich culture to the world yet some artists and writers were killed for their views on the regime.\nEven carrying certain books was once cause for arrest. Today, however, all kinds of books are on display in shops around the capital - even political titles. Cinema clubs screen films that were previously banned too.\nFor weeks after Assad's fall, the caretaker government didn't appoint a Minister of Culture, but musicians and artists grouped together to protect the culture scene. \nNow, however, there are fresh concerns: while Syria under Assad saw political debates repressed, some worry that repression by clerics could end up forbidding some forms of art seen as anti-religious.\nThere is no clear evidence of this. Dr Maher Al Sharaa, the brother of the interim president, has been seen at the city's Opera House with his family; Vivaldi was played by Syrian musicians. The family looked like any modern one who would go on a weekend for theatre.\nAnd after the fall of Assad, a cultural event with talks about cinema, music, theatre and performances was held at Beit Farhi, a historic house in the heart of Damascus's Jewish quarter. An all-female orchestra played songs that praised revolutions and martyrs. Some in the audience were left in tears.\n\"It is great to have this opportunity to talk among us about how to protect and support the art scene in Syria,\" says Noura Murad, a choreographer.\nMr al-Atassi also chooses to be optimistic. \"I believe the Syrians won't allow this regime to enter in their private lives, to create rules on how to behave in the public space.\"\nWhen Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad, was appointed by a military council on 29 January, he delivered a speech in which he stressed that the priority was to \"fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way\".\nBut months on, there is concern among some around the likelihood of building a lasting democracy. And there is no system in place to hold officials, including the president, accountable until a permanent constitution is adopted and elections are held.\n\"The past few months, the regime has not been ready to share power and allow other political and social forces to find their place in society,\" argues Mr Al-Atassi. \"Without opening up the political arena to other forces, I don't think Sharaa can bring Syria back to the international community.\"\nIn February, hundreds gathered at the People's Palace in Damascus for a two-day national dialogue about Syria's future. Some critics argued that the meeting was organised in haste and was too short to cover all the key topics.\nAccording to Abdulhay Sayed, a Syrian legal expert and managing partner at Sayed and Sayed law firm, it was neither representative nor truly reflective of consensus.\n\"Large segments of Syrian society felt excluded or unrepresented,\" he argues. \"[It] was conceived as a mechanism to simulate wider assent.\"\nHowever, he concedes: \"It does reflect a certain willingness on the part of the new authorities to expand the scope of consultation.\"\nSharaa, who was leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaeda affiliate and Islamist group that dominated the rebel alliance, has clearly stated his commitment to establishing a country with \"free and impartial elections\".\nHe has also appointed a committee to work on a constitutional declaration, which laid out Syria's future over a five-year transitional period. However, the subsequent declaration didn't enshrine the separation of powers.\n\"He needs to show that he's more serious about political participation from all groups,\" says Mr Al-Atassi.\nThere are some examples of this: a Christian female minister was appointed minister for social affairs, while head of the White Helmet civil defence group, became minister of emergencies and disasters. But some have raised questions about the appointment of Sharaa's brother as head of presidential affairs.\n\"High-ranking former HTS members now occupy key sovereign positions,\" adds Mr Sayed.\nMr Al-Atassi also claims that \"highly qualified people in international law were not asked to participate in the Cabinet. They were overlooked.\"\nThe Minister of Justice holds a degree in Sharia law (Islam's legal system, derived from the Quran), and is not an expert on Syria's Civil Code, which draws heavily on French and Ottoman law. One question being asked is whether codes based on Sharia law could be applied rather than civil ones.\n\"The new authorities have so far made no attempt to replace the existing legal codes with Sharia-inspired legislation,\" says Mr Sayed. However, he adds, \"this remains an area we continue to monitor closely.\n\"The most pressing concern is whether judicial independence will be restored and effectively safeguarded. This represents a major challenge.\n\"There is little indication that the new authorities are genuinely committed to re-establishing an independent judiciary.\"\n\nUnder Assad's regime, women had relatively equal rights and had been represented in parliament since the 1950s, as well as being present in society at all levels. There are no new written rules that might point to how that could change \u2013 but there are some worrying signs.\nOnly one woman was appointed in the interim government. According to research by University College London and McGill University, women's rights advocates have raised concerns over HTS enforcing an interpretation of Islamic law, which could for example severely restrict women's mobility, dress and public participation.\n\"One important area to watch is whether women judges \u2013 who make up approximately 35 to 40 per cent of the judiciary \u2013 will face marginalisation or dismissal,\" says Mr Sayed. \"So far, we have seen no signs of such a trend, but continued vigilance is essential.\"\nAs for religious freedoms, there have been no new laws or rulings restricting social life, but some Syrians report that they have seen what appear to be attempts to enforce Islamic rule.\nThe Ministry of Justice has begun separating entry for men and women, plus there have been reports of men distributing flyers on buses and in Umayyad Mosque in Damascus asking women to wear full-faced veils.\nIn Christian neighbourhoods in the capital, cars have been filmed driving through the streets with preachers advocating for Islam over loudspeakers. An order to shut down bars and restaurants in the old city's Christian quarter was only revoked after a public outcry.\nSome observers of Islam tell me they are worried. Damascus is known for its tolerance but there are fears in some quarters that the new authorities have a Salafi background (a strict, orthodox Sunni Muslim sect). \n\"There is an increasing call for a return to religious values,\" says Mr Sayed. \"This presents a profound challenge for those who still believe in democracy, the rule of law, and equal citizenship.\"\nHowever Husam Jazmati, a Syrian academic who researches Islamic movements at the civil society research organisation Impact, claims that Sharaa \"opposes both Islamist and non-Islamist political movements [and] neither wants to establish an Islamic state nor believes it's possible.\n\"They don't want to, and they can't\".\nEven if the government wanted to instil hardline practices, the question is whether they could? Alaa El Din Al Sayyek, an imam based in Damascus, thinks not. He argues that Syrians would reject any attempt to do so.\n\"It is impossible, our society will not accept it,\" he tells me. \"We have lived in harmony with different sects for years even during difficult times. The Quran says it clearly: no compulsion in religion.\"\nToday there are growing tensions: violence in coastal cities has left more than 1,400 people dead, many of them Alawites (part of Assad's minority sect). They were said to be revenge for attacks on Syrian security forces.\nElsewhere, in the north east of the country, even though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in 2019, camps still hold about 56,000 people, many of them the family members of Islamic State group (IS) suspects, more than five years after the jihadists' territorial defeat in Syria.\nThe main question now facing the country, however, is how Syrians see their future. There are some tensions around this, which have seeped into a push-pull between the leadership and HTS, according to Mr Jazmati. \nHe claims that while Sharaa's top circle wants to build \"a conservative, economically liberal\" state, \"they can't stop many of their members \u2013 those they've appointed in various positions and rely on because they're trusted \u2013 from trying to Islamise public life in Syria.\"\nThe think tank International Crisis Group has similar concerns. It has said that it believes Syria is living \"on borrowed time\".\n\"The interim government is running out of funds, security forces are overstretched, poverty is deepening and insurgency is brewing at the periphery. Outsiders are meddling. Western sanctions deprive leaders of what they need to rebuild, while preventing fragmentation or a return to civil war.\"\nFor Mr Al-Atassi, the solution is straightforward: He believes Sharaa needs to open up the political arena. \"There are no elections today in Syria, there are only nominations,\" he says. \"This is very dangerous.\"\nWith a pause, he adds: \"It could be that a new dictatorship is in the making - but I don't believe that the Syrian people are ready, after five decades, to accept a new dictatorship.\"\nAnd as for the prospect of lasting democracy? \"We need to wait to see,\" he says. \"But I'm not at all optimistic.\"\nHowever there is a wider issue too. That is, could there be a wider loss of faith in the very idea of democracy given the country's recent history? \nMr Sayed thinks so. \"Though the Assad-era constitutions formally proclaimed political freedoms\u2026 our experience of political modernity came in the form of shells falling on our heads, while our bodies were laid bare in detention camps,\" he tells me.\n\"Large segments of the Syrian population have lost faith in the promises of political modernity.\"\nOf the many challenges facing the new leadership, perhaps it is this that they would be wise to address first as they continue to carve out a new path for the future of Syria.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nRice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.\nSo it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.\nThe presence of arsenic in rice has long been known as a problem. Almost all rice contains arsenic. The harmful, naturally occurring chemical can accumulate in the soil of paddy fields, leaching into the grains of rice grown there. But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.\nYet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nResearchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice \u2013 and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).\nBut a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.\nThey found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.\n\"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health \u2013 it's a long laundry list,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. \"And two metrics of climate change \u2013 the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures \u2013 are resulting in greater amounts.\"\nIt's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions \"business as usual\" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.\nWhile the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.\n\"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature \u2013 but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,\" says Ziska.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 Saving Italy's polluted sea\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\nOf course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice \u2013 so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.\nStill, this is \"one of the most comprehensive studies\" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. \"This is as robust as you\u2019re ever likely to get.\"\nHumans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.\nOver the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.\nThis is particularly true of inorganic arsenic, which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why \"natural\" doesn\u2019t always mean better).\nThis means inorganic arsenic is particularly prevalent in the groundwater in a number of regions, including South America and parts of southern and central Asia. But people elsewhere are vulnerable too: in the US, for example, more than 7% of private well owners, or 2.1 million people, are drinking dangerous levels of inorganic arsenic. Worldwide, some 140 million people drink water with arsenic levels above the WHO-recommended guidelines.\u00a0\nAnd, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.\nLowering the arsenic in your rice\nIf you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.\nFirst, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.\nThe UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.\nThe problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska \u2013 in irrigated paddy fields.\nRice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. \"That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,\" Ziska says. \"But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil.\" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.\n\"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,\" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.\nAnd this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. \"This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,\" Ziska says. \"It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.\"\nZiska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.\nWhat worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's \"cancer potency factor\", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that \"arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed\", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.\nAside from cancer, inorganic arsenic raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. When consumed by pregnant women, it also makes foetal or infant mortality more likely, as well as raises the risk that the infant will be born low birth weight \u2013 which can have lifelong health impacts such as cardiovascular disease \u2013 or have developmental neurocognitive effects.\nFor individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day \u2013 or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person \u2013 would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.\nBut across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.\nInorganic arsenic\nIf everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that \u2013 compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic \u2013 an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.\nThe amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.\nSo, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?\n\"We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,\" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. \"But we need to do something differently.\"\nResearchers have also been experimenting with whether different types of water management could reduce arsenic levels. One process \u2013 where, instead of flooding a field continuously, the field is partly flooded, drained and then flooded again \u2013 does seem to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic. \"But that just increases cadmium,\" Marham says. \"And cadmium is perceived as an even bigger threat.\" Cadmium can cause breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancers, as well as liver and kidney disease.\nThere is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.\nBecause some types of rice accumulate less inorganic arsenic, there is interest in exploring their cultivation. Another solution might be adding sulphur to water, which can absorb electrons, like arsenic. Another way to shift the microbiome of fields could be adding certain types of fertiliser \u2013 one combination found to decrease arsenic content has been a mix of mountain thyme and bird manure. But more research on any of these approaches is needed.\nAnother approach may be to grow rice under rainwater-fed conditions, or where both the soil and irrigation water are lower in arsenic. Rice from East Africa, which tends to be rainwater- rather than irrigation-fed, has been found to be particularly low in inorganic arsenic, as has rice in Indonesia. Rice grown in the US, Central and South America, south-east Asia, Europe and Australia all have been found to have higher amounts of arsenic.\nThere also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. \"Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,\" says Marham.\u00a0\nCurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.\n\"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,\" Ziska says. \"It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.\nIn the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.\n- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you\u2019re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.\n- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.\nDees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The leaders of Canada's four major federal parties have been grilled about their response to US President Donald Trump and clashed over energy and housing in their first televised debate of the country's election campaign.\nThe French-language face-off marked a key moment in the election as it gave leaders a chance to woo voters in the seat-rich province of Quebec. \nIt was also a big test for Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has a slight lead in the polls, but whose French is the weakest among the federal leaders. He at times struggled to articulate his points on stage.\nThere is a second debate in English on Thursday, before Canadians vote on 28 April. \nOn the stage were the four main party candidates: Liberal leader and current Prime Minister Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, and leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh. \nThe debate was moderated by Radio-Canada journalist Patrice Roy. \nMr Roy opened the forum saying that Canada's short 36-day federal election had been \"hijacked by Trump\", and asked each leader to outline two campaign promises unrelated to the US or its tariffs.\nBut soon afterwards, Mr Roy plunged into a question on how each party would handle the trade war with the US, calling it the \"elephant in the room\". \nTrump has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars. \nThe president has also publicly mused about Canada becoming the 51st US state. \nPoilievre, of the opposition Conservatives, accused the governing Liberals of weakening the country over the past decade, making Canada more vulnerable to economic threats.\nCarney touted his experience as a former central banker for both Canada and the UK, as well as his time in the private sector.\n\"[Trump] respects people who understand the world and how the private sector works,\" Carney said. \nSingh, of the left-leaning NDP, sought to paint both Poilievre and Carney as the wrong option for Canadians whose jobs may be affected by US tariffs.\n\"Both will cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires,\" he said.\nFor Carney, the French-language debate was arguably the first major test of the campaign trail. \nA second debate will be held on Thursday night with the contenders speaking in English.\nThat forum will be more widely watched nationwide, but the stakes were high on Wednesday for Carney's Liberals, which are leading in Quebec where the majority of French-speaking Canadians live.\nHis French was the weakest on stage, and he often kept his answers brief and sometimes struggled to get his points across in a debate format with opportunities for rapid exchanges.\nHe also faced the most frequent attacks as the others leaders tried to tie him to the Liberal record of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned last month. \n\"We are still talking about the same party, the same caucus,\" the Bloc's Blanchet said. \nHe added: \"It's not because you change the leader that you change your philosophy.\"\nCarney countered that he had accomplishments despite only being sworn in as PM last month. He had \"just arrived\", he said. \nThere was a moment of levity when Mr Roy asked the leaders if they were buying fewer US products - like many Canadians are in the face of tariffs - at the grocery store. \nCarney had admitted in an interview early this month that he does not do his own groceries when asked if he still buys US strawberries. \nSingh and Blanchet both said they bought Canadian berries. Carney said he had given up US wine, while Poilievre said he buys Canadian beef. \nTrump was not the only issue on the agenda. The leaders were asked about their plan to address Canada's housing crisis, and how they would balance climate and the economy.\nOn housing, Poilievre vowed to cut taxes and red tape that he says act as a barrier to home building. \n\"We don't need more bureaucracy, we need more front doors,\" the Conservative leader said in a jab directed at Carney. \nBut the two found common ground on energy, saying the country should ramp up its oil and gas production. \nCarney said climate remains a priority for his party, adding that he would focus on producing \"low-risk\", \"low-carbon\" oil. \nOn immigration, there was also wide agreement that Canada must look at its capacity to integrate newcomers and asylum seekers. \nCanada has seen a rapid population boom in recent years and social and housing infrastructure has struggled to catch up.\nCanadian border officials recently noted an uptick in asylum seekers looking to cross the Quebec-US border as a result of the Trump administration's hardline  immigration policies.\nAbsent from the debate stage was the Green Party. In a last-minute decision by the debate commission, it was disqualified for failing to meet the criteria by not endorsing candidates in at least 90% of Canada's federal ridings, or constituencies. \nThe party, which had two MPs in parliament when the election was called, also failed to meet the threshold of at least 4% in national support. \nGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Pedneault called the commission's decision \"baseless\" and \"undemocratic\". \nIt wasn't the only change to the debate. \nOn Tuesday, the start time was officially moved forward by two hours to accommodate an NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Carolina Hurricanes, with a spot in the Stanley Cup play-offs at stake.",

Players do not have to be a club member to acquire a handicap which can then be used at any course in the world.\nIn line with scores submitted, golfers are given a 'handicap index' which will provide the appropriate number of shots for the difficulty of the course they are playing.

It's also the nation's sole producer of artichokes, figs, olives, walnuts and raisins.\nNewsom argued California has been \"disproportionately affected\" by the tariffs and that's why the state, which has already filed 15 lawsuits against Trump since January, would lead the charge against the levies - which currently are 10% on most countries and 145% on China. \n\"That's our state of mind,\" the governor said. \"That's why we're asserting ourselves on behalf of 40 million Americans.\"\nThe lawsuit challenges Trump evoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact the tariffs, arguing the act had never been used for such levies and such powers rest with the US Congress. \nThe lawsuit cites multiple times from rulings by the US Supreme Court against the Biden administration in its quest to forgive student debt, noting the high court called Biden's manoeuvres a \"transformative expansion\" of presidential authority. \nNewsom said if the Supreme Court is \"consistent, then this lawsuit is a lock\" for the state. \nThe act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president, congressional research shows. \nWhile California is the first state to file legal action against the Trump administration over the levies, several other lawsuits filed by small businesses and a civil rights group have similarly challenged Trump's authority on the matter. \nSince Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs.\nThe US president says the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.\nCritics argue that bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime.\nTrump has also backtracked on many of his announcements.\nJust hours after steep levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries except China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets.",

Humans are tired... you kind of know that your personal bias is entering in to your marking,\" he added.\nDave Costen, digital lead for Elizabeth College, said AI was not yet able to substitute for teaching.\nMr Costen said one difference was AI gave \"too much [information] to students straight away\" whereas teachers \"develop the learning [of students] gradually\".\nStudents generally have a poor understanding of AI, he said.\nDespite this, some Elizabeth College students had experimented with the technology, he said. \nOne student explained to the BBC that AI was not good at adjusting the difficulty of example questions. \nAnother student said some of their peers over-relied on AI, and used it to complete work for them, which was not helping them learn.\nAI was also better at some subjects than others, a third explained. It was very strong at coding, but in subjects that required reasoning it \"really struggled\".\nParent Gazz Barbe said he uses parental controls to restrict his daughter's phone use, and added that he did not allow the use of AI technology. \n\"I worry that if I give my daughter unrestricted access to this technology, she will use it to complete homework assignments. \n\"And if she does this in a subject that she really struggles with, she could easily become over-reliant on the technology,\" he said.\n\"The positive potential is absolutely massive... so long as it's used as a tool to assist teachers instead of doing the teaching,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

        "article_text": "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is heading to the US to meet Donald Trump \u2013 a visit that will see her walk a tightrope between representing the interests of the EU and remaining in the US president's good books.\nAs the first European leader to travel to Washington since Trump introduced - then paused \u2013 20% tariffs on the EU earlier in April, Meloni will be hoping to convince him of the merits of a \"zero-for-zero\" tariffs deal for the entire EU.\nItaly is particularly vulnerable to any changes to US trade policy. \nAround 10% of its exports - worth about \u20ac67bn (\u00a357bn; $76bn) - go to the US, Italy's third biggest non-EU trading partner, and the tariffs announced by Trump earlier this month caused Rome to halve its growth forecast.\n\"We know this is a difficult time,\" Meloni said ahead of her trip. \"We will do our best \u2013 I am aware of what I represent and of what I am defending.\"\nAt this fraught moment, she is perhaps one of the best-placed current European leaders to speak to Trump. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen recognises that and they have been speaking regularly ahead of the trip.\nTrump and Meloni famously enjoy a good relationship and have lavished praise on one another in the past. He has called her a \"fantastic woman\" who has \"really taken Europe by storm\".\nFor her part, Meloni \u2013 who has headed a right-wing coalition government since 2022 - is ideologically closer to Trump than to some of her European neighbours. \nIn a video message to a US conservative conference in February, she echoed some of Trump's common talking points, railing against mass migration, \"globalist elites\" and \"woke ideology\". \nShe was also the only European leader to attend the US president's inauguration in January, and has steered clear of overtly criticising the work of his administration since.\nThe harshest criticism she has dispensed was earlier this month, when she said Trump's decision to impose 20% tariffs on the EU was \"absolutely wrong\" and that it would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\n\"Meloni has always said that Europe shouldn't take any decisions that put it on a collision course with the US, and that Europe should adapt rather than resist,\" said Riccardo Alcaro of the Italian Institute for International Affairs in Rome.\n\"If the Trump administration is immovable on tariffs, she'll agree to counter-tariffs. But her first move is always to say no. Because ultimately she thinks the importance of the West in the world is thanks to the US, and that the West revolves around the US.\"\nMeloni's world view is also closer to that of many of Trump's main allies than many of her European neighbours.\n\"She knows that Italy is strategically, politically and economically subordinate to the EU \u2013 but she also has a genuine proximity to MAGA Republicans,\" Alcaro added.\nUS Vice-President JD Vance is due to travel to Rome on Friday for Easter, and will see Meloni as well as leading officials at the Vatican.\nMeloni's natural affinity to an administration many in Europe are having trouble finding common ground with has sparked concern among some Europeans that, in the privacy of the Oval Office, she may be tempted to go at it alone and argue for more favourable terms for Italy.\nLast week France's Industry Minister Marc Ferracci spoke out against \"bilateral talks\" and warned Trump's strategy was to \"divide Europeans\". \nHis comments irritated Rome and had to be toned down later by a French government spokesperson.\nThe European Commission has signalled it has confidence in Meloni, and a spokeswoman said \"any outreach to the US [was] very welcome\". \nHowever, the spokeswoman also said Meloni's trip was being \"closely coordinated\" with the institutions, and underlined that handling trade policy was a job for the EU. \nThe EU negotiates on behalf of all member states, and no single country can negotiate lower tariffs for its own benefit. \nMeloni's team appears clear on this and Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said that Meloni \"isn't going to negotiate for Italy against Europe but is going to champion a European stance\".\nUltimately the Italian leader's mission may be to emphasise to Trump that the EU is keen to reach a zero-tariff agreement and commit to buying American \u2013 especially when it comes to defence and liquified natural gas (LNG).\nAnd, in more hushed tones, she may also tell him that Europe is in no rush to make any deals with China. \n\"I don't know how public this will be but I think there will be some anti-China discourse as an incentive for the US administration,\" Riccardo Alcaro said.\nAt home, party allies were singing Meloni's praises before her plane to Washington even left the ground. \n\"This meeting shows Giorgia Meloni's courage and stature,\" said Brothers of Italy (FdI) MP Augusta Montarulli - although Senator Giovanbattista Fazzolari, somewhat less encouragingly, warned the trip would be \"full of potential pitfalls\". \nAnd centre-left opposition parties took the opportunity to berate Meloni's proximity to the Trump administration. \n\"I have a feeling that upon her return Meloni will be flying the Trump flag rather than Italy's or Europe's,\" said Peppe Provenzano of the Democratic Party (PD). \n\"I hope to be proven wrong.\"\nAt an awards ceremony in Rome on Tuesday, Meloni addressed a room packed with entrepreneurs and business leaders \u2013 the very same who stand to lose the most from Trump's tariffs.\nLooking ahead to her trip to Washington, she chuckled nervously.\n\"As you can imagine,\" she joked, \"I'm feeling no pressure at all.\"",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump and Giorgia Meloni talked up the chances of a trade deal between the US and Europe, as the Italian prime minister visited Washington.\n\"There will be a trade deal, 100%,\" Trump said, \"but it will be a fair deal\", while Meloni said she was \"sure\" they could reach an agreement, later adding that her aim was to \"make the West great again\".\nMeloni is the first European leader to visit Washington since Trump imposed, then paused, 20% tariffs on imports from the bloc.\nThe US president separately said on Thursday that he is confident of making \"a very good deal\" with China, adding that representatives from Beijing have reached out \"a number of times\". \nTrump and Meloni enjoy a good relationship and the Italian leader hopes to position herself as a bridge between the EU and the US amid fractured relations and mounting concerns about the global impact of Trump's tariffs.\nDespite his confidence in an eventual deal, Trump said he was in \"no rush\".\n\"Everybody wants to make a deal. And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,\" he said, adding that he expects to cut deals with every country \"over the next three to four weeks\".\nTrump also suggested that he was reluctant to further raise tariffs on China - which currently stand at 145%. \n\"I may not want to go higher. I may want to go to less because you know, you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nAt a press conference on Thursday following Trump's and Meloni's conversation, the leaders said they had discussed defence spending, immigration and tariffs.\nThe atmosphere in the Oval Office appeared relaxed and good-natured - similar to the reception UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received during his visit to the White House in February.\nHowever Meloni's aides had described the visit as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's decision to impose a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US. \nHe has strongly criticised the European Union on trade, claiming it was \"formed to screw the United States\". A 20% \"retaliatory\" tariff on the EU has been temporarily suspended until July.\nMeloni previously called the tariffs \"absolutely wrong\" and said they would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\nWhile she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.\nGiven the fraught relations between the EU and the US, Meloni will likely chalk that up as a significant win, particularly if Trump agrees to meet the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, during the visit.\nMeloni will return to Europe with stronger credentials as the so-called \"Trump whisperer\", something that will be reinforced when she meets US Vice President JD Vance in Rome tomorrow.\nThe Italian leader was careful to praise Trump and align herself with the US president's viewpoints.\nIn her statement following the meeting, she criticised \"woke ideology\" and championed the \"war against illegal migration\".\n\"The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,\" she added.\nShe also seized the opportunity to tout the work of her own government. \"I'm proud of sitting here as prime minister of an Italy that today has a very good situation - a stable country, a reliable country,\" Meloni said. \nShe noted that her government had brought inflation down and improved employment, before gesturing towards Trump and adding with a broad smile: \"Forgive me if I promote my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me\". Trump grinned back.\nMeloni basked in the praise lavished on her by Trump - from compliments about her work as prime minister to gushing about her Italian sounding \"beautiful\".\nThe US president praised Meloni for taking a tough stance on immigration and said he wished more people were like her. Meloni said that change was happening, thanks to the example set by Italy, referring to yesterday's EU announcement on safe countries.\nIt was only occasionally that she showed a tinge of irritation when asked about Italy's low defence spending.\nMeloni said that she expects Italy to announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to meet the alliance's requirement that each member nation spends 2% of GDP on defence.\nDefence spending has been a key sticking point for Trump, with the US leader repeatedly demanding that Nato allies increase spending. \nItaly is one of eight countries that currently does not meet the 2% threshold, spending 1.49% on defence.\nItalian opposition leader Carlo Calenda said there had been \"two very positive outcomes\" from the visit: that Meloni \"stayed on track on Ukraine and managed to convince Trump to meet EU figures in Italy\".\nCalenda said Meloni had \"gained credibility as a bridge between the US and the EU\" but criticised her praise of \"Trump's fight on woke culture\".",

        "article_text": "Ronnie O'Sullivan has won a record 41 ranking titles\nHalo World Championship\nVenue: Crucible Theatre, Sheffield Dates: 19 April to 5 May\nCoverage: Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app; live text coverage of selected matches; updates on Radio 5 Live.\nSeven-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will overcome \"stage fright\" to take on Ali Carter in the first round of the World Snooker Championship. \nO'Sullivan, 49, who only confirmed his participation on Thursday, has not played competitively since snapping his cue at the Championship League in January.\n\"Because it is the World Championship and the last tournament [of the season] I thought I need to try and break that cycle,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"Call it stage fright, I just haven't had the [will] to go and compete. Call it lost my bottle. You sometimes lose your nerve. Just to come here is an achievement for me.\n\"The kind of nerves I have [been] feeling off and on for the last two years have not been good nerves. I have just been not wanting to go out there - sometimes struggling to even take my eyes off the floor. The confidence has been draining away, so it has not been a great place to be.\"\nNext Tuesday's meeting with Carter, who at 18th in the world is the highest ranked qualifier, is a repeat of the 2008 and 2012 Crucible finals, which were both won by 'The Rocket'.\nThe pair also contested a Masters final in 2024, which O'Sullivan triumphed in, but there were genuine fears that he would not go for a record eighth world title in the modern era this year having been an ever-present at the sport's showpiece event since turning professional in 1992. \nHe pulled out of the Masters at Alexandra Palace on medical grounds, missed the German Masters in Berlin and apologised to fans after electing not to play at the Welsh Open.\nHe also withdrew from the World Grand Prix in Hong Kong in March and has not played in anything over a best-of-seven match since his first-round loss to Barry Hawkins at the UK Championship in November.\n\"Ali is a really good match player and I will have to play better than I have been just to give him a game,\" added O'Sullivan. \n\"I really have nothing to lose. I have done well to just get here to be honest. If it was any other tournament I probably wouldn't have come.\n\"I don't know how excited I am because the reason I stopped was because my game was suffering and I wasn't getting anything from it. Not much has changed but I thought at some point I have to try and play.\n\"I am always mentally ready, that has not been a problem. I always find a way to get through any situation but with my game technically I am at a loss with it and I have never been in this situation before in my life. I have never experienced this and it is hard especially at this stage in my career, you sometimes think 'is it worth trying to rebuild?'\" \nWilson, O'Sullivan, Trump, Selby - who will win World Snooker Championship?\nWorld Championship: Match schedule & BBC coverage\nWilson to face Lei, O'Sullivan v Carter at World Championship\nIn the build-up to the 17-day tournament, O'Sullivan said that he received \"a proper good hiding\" while practising with world number 11 Barry Hawkins. \nHowever, recent footage of him constructing a maximum 147 break in less than seven minutes in practice suggests he is acclimatising well to a new cue. \n\"It is the second time I broke my cue. The first time was a similar situation, I was struggling for maybe a year or two and you just get tired in the end and so frustrated,\" O'Sullivan added. \n\"That was kind of like the end of my tether. Obviously regretted it but that is how the game got me.\" \nO'Sullivan, who has won a record 41 ranking titles, also outlined that he is not ready to pack away his cue just yet.\n\"I'd like to do another two or three years playing so the aim is to try and just focus on this event,\" he continued.\n\"The longer term thing is to play another two or three years and finish semi-positive on a career that has been good to me. You need to find a cue you like and I have got one I am kind of happy with.\"\nMark Selby and Ronnie O'Sullivan contested the 2014 World Championship final\nO'Sullivan has previously stressed that he has had to take medication to deal with anxiety and also had a candid studio discussion on TNT Sports, external with Mark Selby earlier this season around the mental health pressures faced by snooker players. \nThat prompted some debate around the potential for players to be offered a counsellor at tournaments to help them deal with issues. \nAnd four-time world champion Selby, who has had well-documented struggles of his own to contend with, believes that service would be a valuable addition to the professional tour.\n\"I don't think we have carried on and progressed with it but I think something definitely needs to happen,\" Selby told BBC Sport. \n\"Ronnie hit the nail on the head. There are probably a lot more players on the tour going through it than you think that just don't speak out or feel strong enough to speak out. \n\"If you had someone like that there, who you could go in a room with for 20 minutes or half an hour to speak to, a neutral person, to get things off your chest, it would be a great addition to the tour for all the players. You would definitely use it for sure.\" \nSelby, 41, also believes that O'Sullivan did the right thing by taking some time away from snooker.\n\"He obviously wasn't in the greatest place to miss all these tournaments. He must be suffering a lot off the table. If I look back at how I was last year going into the World Championship, if I was in the same position now coming in as I was 12 months ago, there is no way I would be playing. \n\"I would pull out and I have learnt from that, and know if I am in the same position I won't make that mistake again.\n\"He's definitely done the right thing. At the end of the day it is a game of snooker and you have to put yourself first and be selfish. \n\"That is what he has done. If he feels as though he is in a better headspace to go and give himself a chance to win the tournament he is doing the right thing to play.\"",

The technology has been used in the play-offs since 2022.Record attendancesThe unpredictable nature of the Championship is reflected in its attendances.More than 12 million people bought tickets to Championship games in 2023-24 - an increase of 22% on the previous season and the highest overall attendance since records began in 1892.The figure is higher than Germany's Bundesliga, Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A, making the Championship the second highest-attended league in Europe, behind the Premier League.",

        "article_text": "Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nRice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.\nSo it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.\nThe presence of arsenic in rice has long been known as a problem. Almost all rice contains arsenic. The harmful, naturally occurring chemical can accumulate in the soil of paddy fields, leaching into the grains of rice grown there. But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.\nYet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nResearchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice \u2013 and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).\nBut a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.\nThey found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.\n\"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health \u2013 it's a long laundry list,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. \"And two metrics of climate change \u2013 the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures \u2013 are resulting in greater amounts.\"\nIt's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions \"business as usual\" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.\nWhile the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.\n\"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature \u2013 but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,\" says Ziska.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 Saving Italy's polluted sea\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\nOf course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice \u2013 so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.\nStill, this is \"one of the most comprehensive studies\" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. \"This is as robust as you\u2019re ever likely to get.\"\nHumans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.\nOver the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.\nThis is particularly true of inorganic arsenic, which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why \"natural\" doesn\u2019t always mean better).\nThis means inorganic arsenic is particularly prevalent in the groundwater in a number of regions, including South America and parts of southern and central Asia. But people elsewhere are vulnerable too: in the US, for example, more than 7% of private well owners, or 2.1 million people, are drinking dangerous levels of inorganic arsenic. Worldwide, some 140 million people drink water with arsenic levels above the WHO-recommended guidelines.\u00a0\nAnd, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.\nLowering the arsenic in your rice\nIf you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.\nFirst, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.\nThe UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.\nThe problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska \u2013 in irrigated paddy fields.\nRice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. \"That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,\" Ziska says. \"But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil.\" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.\n\"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,\" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.\nAnd this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. \"This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,\" Ziska says. \"It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.\"\nZiska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.\nWhat worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's \"cancer potency factor\", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that \"arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed\", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.\nAside from cancer, inorganic arsenic raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. When consumed by pregnant women, it also makes foetal or infant mortality more likely, as well as raises the risk that the infant will be born low birth weight \u2013 which can have lifelong health impacts such as cardiovascular disease \u2013 or have developmental neurocognitive effects.\nFor individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day \u2013 or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person \u2013 would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.\nBut across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.\nInorganic arsenic\nIf everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that \u2013 compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic \u2013 an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.\nThe amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.\nSo, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?\n\"We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,\" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. \"But we need to do something differently.\"\nResearchers have also been experimenting with whether different types of water management could reduce arsenic levels. One process \u2013 where, instead of flooding a field continuously, the field is partly flooded, drained and then flooded again \u2013 does seem to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic. \"But that just increases cadmium,\" Marham says. \"And cadmium is perceived as an even bigger threat.\" Cadmium can cause breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancers, as well as liver and kidney disease.\nThere is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.\nBecause some types of rice accumulate less inorganic arsenic, there is interest in exploring their cultivation. Another solution might be adding sulphur to water, which can absorb electrons, like arsenic. Another way to shift the microbiome of fields could be adding certain types of fertiliser \u2013 one combination found to decrease arsenic content has been a mix of mountain thyme and bird manure. But more research on any of these approaches is needed.\nAnother approach may be to grow rice under rainwater-fed conditions, or where both the soil and irrigation water are lower in arsenic. Rice from East Africa, which tends to be rainwater- rather than irrigation-fed, has been found to be particularly low in inorganic arsenic, as has rice in Indonesia. Rice grown in the US, Central and South America, south-east Asia, Europe and Australia all have been found to have higher amounts of arsenic.\nThere also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. \"Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,\" says Marham.\u00a0\nCurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.\n\"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,\" Ziska says. \"It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "New research is showing just how much plants and crops rely on a host of darkness-dwelling creepy crawlies.\nThink pollination, and you will likely picture a butterfly or bee flitting between flowers. But while these are indeed important pollinators, both the natural world and our food supplies rely on a host of other creatures, some of them decidedly less appealing.\nMost of the world's 350,000 species of flowering plants rely on animal pollinators for reproduction. Pollinators and their importance for ecosystems are increasingly in the spotlight in recent years due to the dramatic decline in their numbers. Birds, bats, bees, bumblebees and butterflies have all been affected, with some populations shrinking by 80% or more. The causes include habitat loss, pesticides and climate change.\nAnd recent research has also shown that pollinator diversity is just as vital for ecosystems and cultivated plants as the sheer numbers of pollinators, and found that this diversity is on the decline for similar reasons.\u00a0\nScientists estimate that 3-5% of fruit, vegetable and nut production is lost globally as a result of inadequate pollination, affecting the availability of healthy food and threatening human health.\nFrom cockroaches and beetles to the tiny \"bees of the seas\", here are some of the most unexpected, and occasionally disconcerting, pollinators the world continues to rely on \u2013 even if we don't always see them.\nCockroaches are, in the words of one study, \"among Earth's most despised creatures\". But recent research suggests they play a beneficial and long overlooked role as plant pollinators \u2013 especially in the darker areas of forest often avoided by the world's more beloved bees and butterflies.\u00a0\n\"Traditionally, pollination has been associated with bees, flies, moths and butterflies,\" says Kenji Suetsugu, a professor of biology at Kobe University in Japan. \"However, emerging studies reveal that unexpected visitors such as cockroaches can play significant roles under certain conditions.\"\u00a0\nThese \"alternative pollinators\", he adds, are often particularly important in environments where conventional pollinators are scarce, such as \"in dense, shaded understories where light is limited and typical pollinators are infrequent\".\nIn fact, a growing body of research suggests that cockroaches act as pollinators in a rich and varied range of ecosystems \u2013 a role that previously went mostly unnoticed by researchers, since the creatures are nocturnal and less obvious in their interactions with plants than bees. In recent years, cockroach pollination has been reported for plant species such as Clusia blattophila, which grows on rocky outcrops in French Guiana, and the rare and endangered Vincetoxicum hainanense in China, amongst others.\nSuetsugu has studied the role of cockroaches in pollination in dense, evergreen forests on Yakushima Island, a lush, subtropical island off Japan. He was specifically interested in cockroach-assisted pollination of Balanophora tobiracola, a mushroom-shaped parasitic plant.\nSince cockroaches are elusive and nocturnal, he used several tricks to better understand their interactions with this plant. For example, he set up a waterproof digital camera in front of one flowering plant which took photos of it in 50-second intervals from dusk till dawn for around three weeks. The resulting photographs \u2013 more than 34,000 shots \u2013 showed cockroaches visiting the flower at night. Suetsugu also captured cockroaches after they'd visited the plant to identify and count the pollen grains on their bodies.\u00a0\nTo investigate how a single cockroach visit affected the plant's chance of setting fruit, he enclosed five of the plant's flowers with a fine mesh and opened it only for one visit by the Margattea satsumana cockroach (the most frequent cockroach visitor for this plant), then closed it again. He compared this with other treatments of the plant, such as covering the flowers with mesh for the entire flowering period, to exclude all pollinators.\nThe study, published in 2025, provides \"the first direct evidence of effective cockroach pollination\" in this type of plant, says Suetsugu. \"In the case of a single visit [by a cockroach], nearly 40% of flowers developed pollen tubes, a strong indicator of successful pollination.\"\u00a0\nAs soon as the first ever flowers unfurled from their buds in the\u00a0early Cretaceous period, they were visited by pollinators. But those first soft landings on their petals weren't by bees or butterflies \u2013 instead, it's thought that the pioneers of pollination may have had six scuttling legs and tough, shiny shells.\u00a0They were beetles.\u00a0\nBeetles remain important pollinators to this day, often visiting flowers with the most seemingly unpromising allure \u2013 little nectar, greenish flowers, and an overpowering, possibly putrid smell, a set of traits known as \"beetle pollination syndrome\".\nDespite millions of years of evolution, beetles remain among the most frequent pollinators of primitive flowers which emerged among the dinosaurs,\u00a0such as magnolias. And unlike the more well-known modern pollinators, many beetles\u00a0like to operate at night, flying or crawling towards the warmth and delectable scent emitted by certain beetle-specialised flowers, such as lowiaceae orchids in Borneo which smell strongly of faeces \u2013 a\u00a0favourite of dung beetles.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs they hover above wild tobacco flowers, hawkmoths unfurl their 8cm (3in)-long proboscis to drink up its nectar \u2013 among their favourite meals. As they do this, grains of pollen are also pulled \u2013 as if by magic \u2013 across air gaps of several millimetres or even centimetres.\nDo slugs and snails pollinate?\n(Credit: Kenji Suetsugu)\nSuetsugu's research on overlooked pollinators in Japan may also help solve a 100-year-old mystery in the field of pollination studies: do slugs and snails pollinate?\nThe idea that slugs and snails can pollinate plants is frequently mentioned in textbooks, but \"robust evidence is surprisingly scarce\", says Suetsugu. This type of pollination, known as malacophily, sounds plausible: as slugs and snails glide over flowers, they pick up pollen and transfer it. However, given that snails and slugs eat flowers, it is unclear whether such visits ultimately help reproduction \u2013 or whether they gobble up the flowers before there is any chance of fruiting.\nA 2019 study by Suetsugu found that a type of slug, Ambigolimax valentianus, transferred pollen via fine threads of viscous mucus after visiting flowers of the Rohdea japonica plant \u2013but that this did not lead to fruiting.\nThis happens because, incredibly, moths collect so much\u00a0static electricity whilst in flight\u00a0that pollen is pulled through the air towards them. The fact that they don't need to touch flowers in order to pollinate them makes them very good pollinators.\u00a0\nThe majority of pollination research has tended to\u00a0focus on day-flying insects, but researchers are now probing what is happening at night.\nIn 2023, researchers from the University of Sussex, UK, discovered moths may even be more efficient pollinators than bees. The team studied both daytime and nocturnal pollinator visits to bramble plants, a widespread species across Europe which is important to pollinators for its pollen and nectar. While the study found that 83% of all visits were made in the day, and just 17% made under cover of darkness (almost exclusively by moths), it also found the moths were able to pollinate the flowers more quickly than their daytime counterparts.\nThe authors say nocturnal pollination is understudied. As moths have been shown to transport pollen from wide variety of plant species, further research is needed to fully appreciate the role they and other nocturnal insects play in pollinating, they say.\u00a0\nAnother recent study from the University of Sheffield, UK, found moths account for a third of all urban pollination. However, a lack of native plant species and diversity of plant life in cities, coupled with scent-stifling air pollution, is still leaving moths struggling to find their next meal. Now, experts are warning of an \"alarming\" global decline in moth abundance and diversity. \u00a0\nThere are ways we can help, though, such as planting white flowers, leaving patches of scrub, rough grass and brambles to grow and turning off lights at night. Night-time pollinators such as moths, it turns out, need protecting just as much as bees.\nBats are another oft-overlooked furry night-time pollinator. While most bats eat mainly insects, at least 500 plant species in the tropics and subtropics are pollinated largely by nectar-feeding bats. Scientists say that bat pollination (chiropterophily) could have advantages: their large size means they can transfer a lot of pollen at once, and they fly long distances compared with many other pollinators. However, the large size of bats can also make pollination by them energetically expensive for plants.\nOne example is the endangered greater long-eared bat, native to the south-western US and Mexico. It feeds mainly on the pollen and nectar of agave (used to make mezcal and tequila) and various cacti, hovering above the plants just like a hummingbird to feed. Along with the lesser long-nosed bat, it is the main pollinator of agave.\nLike agave, the pale flowers these bats feed on are often long and bell-shaped, and many bats have evolved ways to reach the nectar at the bottom of them. An extreme example is the tube-lipped nectar bat, found in the cloud forests of Ecuador. The size of a mouse, it has a tongue more than one and a half times its body length \u2013 the longest tongue-to-body ratio of any mammal and is the sole pollinator of a plant with corolla tubes of matching length. While not in use, it stows this huge tongue down in its rib cage.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A wild 'freakosystem' has been born on Hawaii\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\u2022 How bug poo can help reverse the soil crisis\nIn fragmented tropical habitats, nectar bats play an important role in keeping certain plants populations healthy, but also in pollinating crops for farmers. However, researchers have warned that bats' status as a long-overlooked pollinator means there is a lack of knowledge of how dependent crops are on bats for harvest yield and quality.\nA 2020 study found, for example, that bats were the main pollinators of pitayas (dragon fruit), a major crop in central Mexico \u2013 and that when bats were excluded from pollinating this crop, yields decreased by 35%. Experts have also warned that decreased populations of bats could lead to a fall in agave abundance.\nBats also play an crucial ecological role worldwide for wild plants and crops as both seed dispersers and insect eaters. Pest control by bats has been found to support many crops around the world \u2013 from coffee in Costa Rica and cacao in Indonesia to rice in Thailand and cotton in the US \u2013 sometimes to the tune of billions of dollars in avoided losses.\nLike many other pollinators, bats are being impacted by environmental change around the world, with researchers warning that these changes are putting the pollination services bat species provide at risk.\nDespite their tiny, inconspicuous flowers, seagrasses are capable of reproducing with no help from animals. Turtle grass, for example, a seagrass which grows in shallow seas across the Caribbean, has miniscule, pollen-producing male flowers and female flowers which don't produce pollen. In coordinated cycles, the female flowers open, followed by male flowers, which release pollen into the tides after sunset.\nA decade ago, it was widely believed this was the only way that seagrasses pollinated, with pollinating animals only visiting flowers that bloom in the open air. But in an experiment at an aquarium in Mexico in 2016, ecologist Brigitta van Tussenbroek from the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico and her colleagues showed marine crustaceans were in fact playing a role.\u00a0\n\"At the onset of the night, many small organisms that were hiding during the day from predators started swimming around,\" she says. The majority were barely visible crustacean larvae, which approached the male flowers to feed on the energy-rich pollen embedded in \"a slimy and sticky substance\".\n\"Some of this substance and pollen attached to their body parts when they swim around, while also being tossed to-and-fro by the water movement,\" says van Tussenbroek. On the receiving end, the female flowers have \"tentacle-like stigmas which capture the small pollen-carrying organisms\", thus depositing the pollen grains.\u00a0\u00a0\nMostly, these invertebrates are at the whims of ocean currents, but when waters are calm, they are able to swim purposefully, she adds, earning these bugs the nickname \"the bees of the seas\".\n\"This was a complete surprise,\" says van Tussenbroek, and upended the belief that small free-moving fauna played no role at all in pollinating seagrass.\nBut perhaps even more surprising was the discovery in 2022 that tiny Baltic isopods help transport the pollen-like \"spermatia\" produced by red algae. Does it count as pollination if there is no pollen? The researchers call it \"animal-mediated fertilisation\" and ask what this means for our understanding of pollination, which is believed to have developed around 130 million years ago when flowering plants first appeared on land.\u00a0\nThe discovery opens the possibility that these kinds of symbiotic interactions might have developed completely separately on land and in water \u2013 and that animal-mediated fertilisation may have emerged in the sea well before plants moved ashore.\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

Beetles remain important pollinators to this day, often visiting flowers with the most seemingly unpromising allure \u2013 little nectar, greenish flowers, and an overpowering, possibly putrid smell, a set of traits known as \"beetle pollination syndrome\".Despite millions of years of evolution, beetles remain among the most frequent pollinators of primitive flowers which emerged among the dinosaurs,\u00a0such as magnolias. However, given that snails and slugs eat flowers, it is unclear whether such visits ultimately help reproduction \u2013 or whether they gobble up the flowers before there is any chance of fruiting.A 2019 study by Suetsugu found that a type of slug, Ambigolimax valentianus, transferred pollen via fine threads of viscous mucus after visiting flowers of the Rohdea japonica plant \u2013but that this did not lead to fruiting.This happens because, incredibly, moths collect so much\u00a0static electricity whilst in flight\u00a0that pollen is pulled through the air towards them. Scientists estimate that 3-5% of fruit, vegetable and nut production is lost globally as a result of inadequate pollination, affecting the availability of healthy food and threatening human health.From cockroaches and beetles to the tiny \"bees of the seas\", here are some of the most unexpected, and occasionally disconcerting, pollinators the world continues to rely on \u2013 even if we don't always see them.Kenji SuetsuguCockroach Margattea satsumana in the process of pollinating a Balanophora tobiracola plant in Japan (Credit: Kenji Suetsugu)CockroachesCockroaches are, in the words of one study, \"among Earth's most despised creatures\". (Credit: Kenji Suetsugu)Suetsugu's research on overlooked pollinators in Japan may also help solve a 100-year-old mystery in the field of pollination studies: do slugs and snails pollinate?The idea that slugs and snails can pollinate plants is frequently mentioned in textbooks, but \"robust evidence is surprisingly scarce\", says Suetsugu.",

It has brought a lot to the town but it is an end of an era. \n\"I know the show was struggling but I never thought it would come to this.\" \nThe show, which takes place over two days in mid-August, has been making a loss over recent years said Maelor Owen, chairman of Shropshire Horticultural Society.\nOrganisers cited \"changes to National Insurance (NI) and the minimum wage\", alongside the cost of living crisis as the reason behind the decision.\nMr Maelor, who joined the society in 2004, said: \"[For] people who have been with the society for a long time, it is safe to say people have looked at these things with their heart rather than their head.\n\"But if we continue the way we are then in the next 10 years we will be insolvent, it is no way to run any business or do anything.\"\nHe said the 2024 show operated at a loss of \u00a3400,000, which led organisers to \"act quickly\" and make the decision. \nShrewsbury Town Council have said the news has come as a surprise as they were in discussions with organisers last week. \nHelen Ball, town clerk of Shrewsbury Town Council, said: \"The Shrewsbury Flower Show is more than just a weekend event \u2013 it's part of who we are as a town. \n\"We understand the increasing pressures faced by event organisers in today's climate and sincerely thank the Shropshire Horticultural Society for their many years of dedication. \n\"We acknowledge the financial contribution the Horticultural Society made to the Quarry in 2000, which has left a lasting legacy for the town. \n\"We've always worked closely and positively with their team, and this announcement will come as a disappointment to many.\"\nThe council added that the introduction of the Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill \u2013  Martyn's Law \u2013 has introduced new and challenging responsibilities for event organisers, but said public safety must always remain paramount. \nMark Hooper, from Visit Shropshire, told BBC Radio Shropshire: \"When you say Shrewsbury people say 'flowers', so to lose something like this is terrible news, it is sad more than anything.\"\nMr Hooper said the show is one of Shropshire's top five events of the year, bringing in a \"substantial\" amount of business for accommodation providers and the hospitality sector.\n\"It will be a big loss this year,\" he added. \n\"But Shrewsbury has got some great entrepreneurs, maybe someone else could take it on?\"\nThe 2024 show featured more than 35 floral exhibitors and 175 traders - with expensive extra security measures added following a security threat at the 2023 event.\nMs Thrower, who lived in the park house in the Quarry as a young child, said she understands the society, which is a registered charity, cannot continue to make a loss but added the event has not changed with the times.\n\"It has got into a bit of a rut and just hasn't managed to get out of it,\" she said.\n\"Together people's aspirations and wants have changed over the years but the show hasn't changed with them.\"\nMr Owen said the society will be looking at the event's long-term future, and those who have already bought tickets for the show can request refunds via the society's office. \nAdditional reporting by Paul Shuttleworth\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Leeds United could be promoted alongside Burnley on Easter Monday\nForget hot cross buns and chocolate eggs, the real treat to kick off Easter weekend is a full programme of EFL fixtures on Friday.\nIncredibly with just four games remaining, mathematically every one of the 24 Championship teams can still be either promoted or relegated.\nThere are some seismic fixtures set to have a huge influence on both the promotion races and the relegation scraps across a nine-and-a-half hour window.\nGood Friday? That might be underselling it. Let's take a look at what's in store on Great Friday...\nScott Parker's Burnley need three wins in their final four matches to secure an instant return to the Premier League\nBurnley could be three points clear at the top of the pile hours before Leeds kick off at Oxford United (20:00 BST).\nThe Clarets head to Vicarage Road trying to move 90 minutes closer to an instant Premier League return and all-but end any lingering play-off ambitions for the Hornets.\nScott Parker's men are unbeaten in 29 league games and could equal their club record of 30, set when they won the Division One title in 1921.\n\"This is about staying very level, very focused, not getting involved in the emotions of this time of year,\" Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire.\n\"My message is to stay calm, there's four games left, let's keep chalking them off.\"\nAfter a wobble which saw Daniel Farke's men claim six points from five matches in March, Leeds have rebounded with back-to-back victories to keep the destiny of the title in their own hands.\nManor Solomon, who scored in the 2-1 win over Preston last Saturday, told BBC Radio Leeds: \"We are really happy but we know we need to stay humble. One month ago, we were seven points clear.\n\"We are not done yet, there are still four games to go and we want to win every single game until we secure our promotion.\"\nThe Whites beat Oxford 4-0 at Elland Road in December, although three wins in their past five games have hauled Gary Rowett's side to the brink of survival and a home win under the lights here would all but confirm another season in the Championship.\nAfter a run of three straight defeats, Sheffield United go into the weekend effectively six points adrift of the top-two given their inferior goal difference, but have the chance to halve that deficit as they welcome third-bottom Cardiff to Bramall Lane at 17:30.\n\"Everyone wants to sensationalise things but we haven't been good enough, it's as simple as that,\" boss Chris Wilder told BBC Radio Sheffield.\n\"We've not created enough and we've not been clinical enough in our finishing. We've not done enough at both ends of the pitch.\n\"We have to accept the criticism that comes from losing three games when we should have won two of them. And I am happy to do that.\n\"We've got four games to go and we need to adjust it quickly, we understand that.\"\nYou can read all about the permutations in the relegation scrap here.\nSunderland have looked nailed-on for fourth since before the Christmas decorations went up, but face a fascinating 15:00 BST fixture at Bristol City, 12 points adrift in fifth and seeking to tighten their own grip on a play-off place in what might be a dress rehearsal for a potential semi-final showdown.\nThe Robins have won five of their past six at Ashton Gate and lost just one of their past 11 overall to hold a four-point advantage over the play-off chasing pack.\n\"We've given ourselves something to play for, and credit to the lads because they've done that,\" boss Liam Manning told BBC Radio Bristol.\n\"It's the end of the season, there's going to be lots of twists and turns - it's about controlling what we can, turning up and taking confidence from remaining unbeaten.\"\nAfter returning to winning ways last week following a five-match skid, seventh-placed West Bromwich Albion are leading the pack and would jump back above the dotted line with a win at Coventry, who occupy the final slot in the top-six but would fall out on goal difference should they lose to the Baggies.\nMiddlesbrough, in eighth, could also overhaul the Sky Blues should Albion prevail and they beat bottom club Plymouth at the Riverside.\nMillwall, in ninth, could go level on points with Coventry if they win at Blackburn, who are not quite out the play-off race themselves.\nThe weekend begins with all eyes on the relegation battle as fourth-bottom Derby host second-bottom Luton at 12:30 in possibly the biggest game of the season for both sides.\nThe Rams, in 21st place, are three points above the Hatters, but have a far superior goal difference and a victory at Pride Park could all but secure their safety.\nWrexham fans have been left biting their nails with a one-point lead over Wycombe in the race for automatic promotion\nBirmingham were crowned League One champions without even playing last weekend, as nearest challengers Wrexham played out a stalemate at Wigan.\nBlues host Crawley, seeking to continue their quest to break the EFL points record of 106, set 19 years ago in the Championship by Reading.\nChris Davies' side, who are looking to bounce back from their Vertu Trophy defeat by Peterborough on Sunday, need 12 points from their final six games to better that.\nWrexham return to the Racecourse Ground, seeking to at least maintain their one-point advantage over third-placed Wycombe in the race for the other automatic promotion place.\nWhile the Red Dragons face a Bristol Rovers side who slipped into the relegation zone on goal difference last weekend on the back of a sixth straight defeat, the Chairboys have a different challenge.\nThey head to eighth-placed Bolton, who need a win to ignite their play-off hopes.\nStockport, five points behind Wrexham with four to play, will be assured of a top-six spot if they beat Peterborough or if Leyton Orient and Bolton both fail to win at home to Barnsley and Wycombe respectively.\nCharlton, a point back in fifth, will book their play-off place on Friday if they beat Northampton, 19th, and still not safe, though the Addicks could clinch it even if they lose, depending on results involving Orient, Bolton and Huddersfield at home to Cambridge United.\nBottom club Shrewsbury are 12 points from safety with four games left, so will be relegated on Friday unless they beat Wigan, and Burton and Bristol Rovers both lose at Exeter and Wrexham respectively.\nCambridge United will be down too if they lose at Huddersfield and either Burton or Bristol Rovers win. If the Us avoid defeat, they can't go down before Monday.\nCrawley, a point ahead of Cambridge, can't go down on Friday \u2013 but defeat at Birmingham, coupled with a win for either Burton or Bristol Rovers, would leave the Reds nine points adrift with three games left.\nPort Vale boss Darren Moore has overseen six wins in seven games to guide the Valiants to the top of League Two\nThings might be even more tense in League Two.\nLeaders Port Vale face a crucial trip to Carlisle, who are battling to stay in the EFL with just four games remaining.\nMark Hughes' second-bottom Cumbrians, six points behind Accrington and with an inferior goal difference, could find themselves needing snookers if they lose to the Valiants and Accrington win at Salford.\nVale will be assured of at least a play-off place if they win, although could cement a spot even in defeat if Colchester fail to win at home to Crewe or if Grimsby lose at home to Swindon, managed by former boss Ian Holloway.\nBottom club Morecambe, a point behind Carlisle, would be relegated to the National League if they lose at Bromley, Accrington win and fourth-bottom Tranmere beat Doncaster.\nAlong with Bradford, who host Notts County on Thursday, and Walsall, who will seek to end a 10-match winless streak at home to lowly Harrogate, Doncaster can book a play-off place if they win at Prenton Park and Colchester lose to the Railwaymen.",

        "article_text": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.\nIn the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.\n- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you\u2019re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.\n- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.\nDees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

It's also the nation's sole producer of artichokes, figs, olives, walnuts and raisins.\nNewsom argued California has been \"disproportionately affected\" by the tariffs and that's why the state, which has already filed 15 lawsuits against Trump since January, would lead the charge against the levies - which currently are 10% on most countries and 145% on China. \n\"That's our state of mind,\" the governor said. \"That's why we're asserting ourselves on behalf of 40 million Americans.\"\nThe lawsuit challenges Trump evoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact the tariffs, arguing the act had never been used for such levies and such powers rest with the US Congress. \nThe lawsuit cites multiple times from rulings by the US Supreme Court against the Biden administration in its quest to forgive student debt, noting the high court called Biden's manoeuvres a \"transformative expansion\" of presidential authority. \nNewsom said if the Supreme Court is \"consistent, then this lawsuit is a lock\" for the state. \nThe act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president, congressional research shows. \nWhile California is the first state to file legal action against the Trump administration over the levies, several other lawsuits filed by small businesses and a civil rights group have similarly challenged Trump's authority on the matter. \nSince Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs.\nThe US president says the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.\nCritics argue that bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime.\nTrump has also backtracked on many of his announcements.\nJust hours after steep levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries except China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets.",

        "article_text": "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted. \nEarlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.\nActors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.\nTheir performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.\nPerhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era. \nOn the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double). \nBut on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".\nSo should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?\nBeatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism. \n\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief. \n\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"\nDu Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.\n\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"\nBut he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.\n\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"\nSo does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?\nDu Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch. \n\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"\nEdda Sharpe, a Merseyside-based voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.\nAmong them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.\nBeatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it. \nThe performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.\n\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.\n\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"\nShe said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.\nBut she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.\n\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.\n\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"\nDr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.\nHe said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.\n\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.\n\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.\n\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"\nBut what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films? \nMichael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.\nHawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can. \n\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.\n\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.\n\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"\nThe 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.\nHe added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.\n\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Construction, alcohol and food sponsors are no longer visible on any Premier League shirts, while gambling is more common than ever\nThere was once a time when the shirts of English football's leading clubs were adorned with household brands - but those days are long gone.\nThe Premier League's prestige and global audience is bigger than ever - and lots of the companies who now sponsor shirts don't even operate in the UK, and aren't really even trying to sell anything to fans.\nSo how have shirts sponsorships in the Premier League changed over the decades, and why are gambling firms more prevalent?\nPremier League clubs' self-imposed ban on front-of-shirt gambling sponsors is set to come into effect before the 2026-27 season. But as things stand, 11 teams feature a gambling sponsor on the front of their shirts, an increase of three from last season.\nAccording to figures from GlobalData, the combined value of shirt sponsorship deals involving Premier League clubs and gambling companies in the 2024-25 season is $135.43m (\u00a3101.1m).\nThe other nine clubs are sponsored by companies from four industries - air travel, entertainment, financial services and technology.\nRewind three decades to the foundation of the Premier League and none of its 22 clubs had a shirt sponsorship deal with a gambling company.\nJust over half of the companies which sponsored teams in the 1992-93 campaign were headquartered in the UK, and the majority sold physical products in Britain.\nNowadays, none of the front-of-shirt sponsor companies are aiming to sell physical products that fans can buy directly, and only one is headquartered in the UK. Even that one, Liverpool partner bank Standard Chartered, does not allow UK customers to open a current account with it.\nIndustries such as technology, construction and clothing have almost completely disappeared from shirts.\nFive of the 1992-93 shirt sponsors - Commodore, Fisons, ICI, Mita Copiers and Tulip Computers - have since gone out of business.\nIn the inaugural Premier League season, seven Premier League shirt sponsors companies were based within 100 miles of their club. Of those, four were based within 10 miles, and two - Sheffield United and Ipswich - were located less than a mile away.\nNow, only one club - Liverpool - are based within 1,000 miles of their shirt sponsor's main base.\nThe average distance between a club and their shirt sponsor's main office in 1992-93 was 1,859 miles. Now it is 4,431 miles.\nGlobalisation and advances in technology have also played a role in shifting the dynamic of modern sponsorships - big business and wider influence is increasingly what sponsor companies are aiming for, rather than the cash from the pockets of the fans in the stands.\n\"In the UK there around 70 million people, but worldwide you're talking about a marketplace of billions,\" says Dr Joe Piggin, senior lecturer in sports management and policy at the University of Loughborough. \"So the economic incentives are there for the companies.\"\nAs the global financial picture has changed, companies in countries which enjoyed booming economies in the early 90s that have now weakened - such as Japan - have become less common shirt sponsors.\nMeanwhile, newer money in modern financial strongholds such as the Middle East is being spent on sponsorship deals.\nSponsor companies gain far more from partnerships with clubs than just advertising \u2013 access to private boxes can be used to host clients, photoshoots with superstar players can be used in corporate material, and relationships can in some cases be used for political leverage.\n\"The Premier League should look after itself,\" Piggin says. \"Not just in terms of the economic sustainability, but in terms of connecting with their local communities.\"\nThe Premier League itself does not have an official gambling partner, but Uefa announced its first formal gambling sponsor last summer.\nAccording to data from Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, gambling firms are also the most common sponsors of top division clubs in Belgium, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Russia.\nThe top industries for shirt sponsorships across top divisions in Europe are:\nGambling (15%)\nRetail (12%)\nAir travel; automotive; financial services; food and drink (all 10%)\nIn the Championship, gambling is also the most popular category of shirt sponsor with six clubs - Burnley, Middlesbrough, QPR, Stoke, Sunderland, and Watford.\nThere are no gambling sponsors on shirts in League One and League Two. The most common industries in those divisions are energy, automotive, and food and drink.\nThree Scottish Premiership clubs - Celtic, Dundee United and Rangers - are sponsored by gambling firms.\nResearch shows that gambling advertisements were shown more than 29,000 times in the UK during the first weekend of this Premier League season, almost trebling the previous campaign's figure.\n\"Gambling advertising has become almost inextricably linked to football and the industry makes a concerted effort to target young men, which is the profile most likely to develop problems with gambling,\" says Matt Zarb-Cousin, co-founder of Gamban, software which aims to help users quit online gambling.\n\"There's a generation that's growing up in an environment that associates watching football with betting - they've been conditioned to believe it's a normal thing to do as part of enjoying sport.\"\nAccording to the UK Gambling Commission's latest figures, gambling firms earned revenue of \u00a315.1bn between April 2022 and March 2023. That income has given them plenty to spend on advertising. And even with the front-of-shirt ban looming, some believe they will move their advertising into other areas like pitchside hoardings and maybe even shirt sleeves.\n\"The front-of-shirt sponsorship withdrawal appears symbolic,\" Piggin says. \"I'm quite sceptical about the significance of that move beyond public relations.\nUnder-18s are not allowed to wear shirts with gambling sponsors - meaning young players have featured in games with sponsor-free jerseys.\nLeicester City's 15-year-old winger Jeremy Monga played wearing a shirt without the club's gambling sponsor on the front when he made his debut against Newcastle United earlier in April\nNone of the Premier League's six wealthiest clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - feature a gambling firm on the front of their shirts.\nTargeting clubs lower down the league, who face a much higher threat of relegation and the potential economic insecurity that comes with that, is a way for gambling firms to associate themselves with the Premier League without having to fork out top-end sums.\n\"It is cheaper than sponsoring any of the top six,\" Piggin says. \"And they also get their brand on shirts in photos of these teams playing the top six anyway. So there would be that legitimacy of 'look, we're in the Premier League, who cares who we're sponsoring?'\"\nSome of the gambling sponsors are based in tax havens such as Curacao and Malta, allowing them to keep more of the profits they make from customers.\nUK customers are not even able to bet with some of the gambling companies which feature on the front of shirts. \nThese so-called 'white label' firms instead use sponsorship of Premier League clubs to target customers in other markets.\nThe gambling companies which sponsor Nottingham Forest and Wolves are among those targeting customers in Asia\nA lot of those companies are based in East Asia, and are aimed at customers in China, even though gambling is illegal there.\n\"There are ways around China's gambling ban using VPNs and so on,\" says Dr Raffaello Rossi, lecturer in marketing at the University of Bristol. \"They're advertising in the UK, not China, so the Chinese government can't do anything about it. But still they're reaching the Chinese population because the Premier League is a global phenomenon.\"\nThe fact that UK customers can't gamble with some of these companies doesn't necessarily mean the advertisement has zero impact on British spectators, however.\n\"It can still trigger someone to start betting because you recognise it's a betting sponsor,\" Rossi adds.",

        "article_text": "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.\nOn Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.\nThe California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".\nBut why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?\nNvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.\nIn recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.\nBecause its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.\nWashington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.\nUS restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.\nIn 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.\nA more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.\nHowever, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.\nDeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips. \nNow, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.\nThose companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.\nChim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei. \nAlthough they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.\n\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.\nChina is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.\nThe timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.\nIn his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.\nSeparately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that \"China's market investment and consumption potential is huge\", according to state news agency Xinhua.\nDuring talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.\nThe controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.\nNvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.\nAnd in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.\nGary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between \"two systems\", one dominated by the US and the other by China.\n\"Tech will be less global in that sense, and it will be subject to more restrictions.\"",

But as things stand, 11 teams feature a gambling sponsor on the front of their shirts, an increase of three from last season.\nAccording to figures from GlobalData, the combined value of shirt sponsorship deals involving Premier League clubs and gambling companies in the 2024-25 season is $135.43m (\u00a3101.1m).\nThe other nine clubs are sponsored by companies from four industries - air travel, entertainment, financial services and technology.\nRewind three decades to the foundation of the Premier League and none of its 22 clubs had a shirt sponsorship deal with a gambling company.\nJust over half of the companies which sponsored teams in the 1992-93 campaign were headquartered in the UK, and the majority sold physical products in Britain.\nNowadays, none of the front-of-shirt sponsor companies are aiming to sell physical products that fans can buy directly, and only one is headquartered in the UK. Even that one, Liverpool partner bank Standard Chartered, does not allow UK customers to open a current account with it.\nIndustries such as technology, construction and clothing have almost completely disappeared from shirts.\nFive of the 1992-93 shirt sponsors - Commodore, Fisons, ICI, Mita Copiers and Tulip Computers - have since gone out of business.\nIn the inaugural Premier League season, seven Premier League shirt sponsors companies were based within 100 miles of their club. Of those, four were based within 10 miles, and two - Sheffield United and Ipswich - were located less than a mile away.\nNow, only one club - Liverpool - are based within 1,000 miles of their shirt sponsor's main base.\nThe average distance between a club and their shirt sponsor's main office in 1992-93 was 1,859 miles. Now it is 4,431 miles.\nGlobalisation and advances in technology have also played a role in shifting the dynamic of modern sponsorships - big business and wider influence is increasingly what sponsor companies are aiming for, rather than the cash from the pockets of the fans in the stands.\n\"In the UK there around 70 million people, but worldwide you're talking about a marketplace of billions,\" says Dr Joe Piggin, senior lecturer in sports management and policy at the University of Loughborough. \"So the economic incentives are there for the companies.\"\nAs the global financial picture has changed, companies in countries which enjoyed booming economies in the early 90s that have now weakened - such as Japan - have become less common shirt sponsors.\nMeanwhile, newer money in modern financial strongholds such as the Middle East is being spent on sponsorship deals.\nSponsor companies gain far more from partnerships with clubs than just advertising \u2013 access to private boxes can be used to host clients, photoshoots with superstar players can be used in corporate material, and relationships can in some cases be used for political leverage.\n\"The Premier League should look after itself,\" Piggin says. \"Not just in terms of the economic sustainability, but in terms of connecting with their local communities.\"\nThe Premier League itself does not have an official gambling partner, but Uefa announced its first formal gambling sponsor last summer.\nAccording to data from Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, gambling firms are also the most common sponsors of top division clubs in Belgium, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Russia.\nThe top industries for shirt sponsorships across top divisions in Europe are:\nGambling (15%)\nRetail (12%)\nAir travel; automotive; financial services; food and drink (all 10%)\nIn the Championship, gambling is also the most popular category of shirt sponsor with six clubs - Burnley, Middlesbrough, QPR, Stoke, Sunderland, and Watford.\nThere are no gambling sponsors on shirts in League One and League Two. The most common industries in those divisions are energy, automotive, and food and drink.\nThree Scottish Premiership clubs - Celtic, Dundee United and Rangers - are sponsored by gambling firms.\nResearch shows that gambling advertisements were shown more than 29,000 times in the UK during the first weekend of this Premier League season, almost trebling the previous campaign's figure.\n\"Gambling advertising has become almost inextricably linked to football and the industry makes a concerted effort to target young men, which is the profile most likely to develop problems with gambling,\" says Matt Zarb-Cousin, co-founder of Gamban, software which aims to help users quit online gambling.\n\"There's a generation that's growing up in an environment that associates watching football with betting - they've been conditioned to believe it's a normal thing to do as part of enjoying sport.\"\nAccording to the UK Gambling Commission's latest figures, gambling firms earned revenue of \u00a315.1bn between April 2022 and March 2023. That income has given them plenty to spend on advertising. And even with the front-of-shirt ban looming, some believe they will move their advertising into other areas like pitchside hoardings and maybe even shirt sleeves.\n\"The front-of-shirt sponsorship withdrawal appears symbolic,\" Piggin says. \"I'm quite sceptical about the significance of that move beyond public relations.\nUnder-18s are not allowed to wear shirts with gambling sponsors - meaning young players have featured in games with sponsor-free jerseys.\nLeicester City's 15-year-old winger Jeremy Monga played wearing a shirt without the club's gambling sponsor on the front when he made his debut against Newcastle United earlier in April\nNone of the Premier League's six wealthiest clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - feature a gambling firm on the front of their shirts.\nTargeting clubs lower down the league, who face a much higher threat of relegation and the potential economic insecurity that comes with that, is a way for gambling firms to associate themselves with the Premier League without having to fork out top-end sums.\n\"It is cheaper than sponsoring any of the top six,\" Piggin says. \"And they also get their brand on shirts in photos of these teams playing the top six anyway. So there would be that legitimacy of 'look, we're in the Premier League, who cares who we're sponsoring?'\"\nSome of the gambling sponsors are based in tax havens such as Curacao and Malta, allowing them to keep more of the profits they make from customers.\nUK customers are not even able to bet with some of the gambling companies which feature on the front of shirts. \nThese so-called 'white label' firms instead use sponsorship of Premier League clubs to target customers in other markets.\nThe gambling companies which sponsor Nottingham Forest and Wolves are among those targeting customers in Asia\nA lot of those companies are based in East Asia, and are aimed at customers in China, even though gambling is illegal there.\n\"There are ways around China's gambling ban using VPNs and so on,\" says Dr Raffaello Rossi, lecturer in marketing at the University of Bristol. \"They're advertising in the UK, not China, so the Chinese government can't do anything about it. But still they're reaching the Chinese population because the Premier League is a global phenomenon.\"\nThe fact that UK customers can't gamble with some of these companies doesn't necessarily mean the advertisement has zero impact on British spectators, however.\n\"It can still trigger someone to start betting because you recognise it's a betting sponsor,\" Rossi adds.",

        "article_text": "The Fantasy Premier League season heads straight into a second straight double gameweek.\nWith only four teams playing twice in week 33 - Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal Palace - you'll probably see a lot of similar teams among your rivals and FPL experts at the moment, but there are still gains to be made if you play it smart.\nHere's BBC Sport's team of the week and the answers to some key questions for gameweek 33.\nThere is one standout option this week - Arsenal's Bukayo Saka.\nIf you knew Saka was going to play twice, he is the most exciting pick, with Ipswich away and Palace at home.\nDoes Mikel Arteta rest him? Arsenal have Newcastle breathing down their neck for second place and keep dropping points so the Gunners boss can't afford too much rotation.\nThey also have a six-day break between the Palace game and their Champions League semi-final against Paris St-Germain.\nI'm confident Saka plays at least 120 minutes this gameweek and probably more.\nGameweek 33 is the best chance to Bench Boost before the end of the season, even if we get another double in 36.\nIf you have 15 playing assets and you like the match-ups for most of them, then pull the trigger.\nThe main issue is game time - there are not a lot of nailed-on assets among Arsenal, City or Villa. Palace are a little more predictable but all four teams might have their minds on cup competitions.\nSo make your peace with the fact that there will be benchings and play that chip. \nDon't be going mad shipping out good single gameweek players to squeeze another double option into your team.\nLiverpool - face woeful Leicester so Mohamed Salah is a must and Virgil van Dijk has as good a clean sheet chance as any double gameweek defender.\nWest Ham - Jarrod Bowen jumps out as the Hammers host relegated Southampton. You should also be confident starting a West Ham defensive asset.\nManchester United - Wolves at home could be productive for Bruno Fernandes. Four of his five double-digit hauls this season have come against teams in the bottom five (at the time).\nI'd also advise against taking too many hits to bring in double gameweek players - a -4 can pay off. Any more and you are asking for a lot to go your way to make up that difference.\nIt's hard to go back to defender Daniel Munoz, who finished with -1 points in gameweek 32. He's still super attacking - with eight entries into the box in 32 - and was close to an assist, but Bournemouth and Arsenal are both likely to score against Palace.\nBut I'd still put your faith in attacking assets such as Eberechi Eze, Ismaila Sarr and Jean-Philippe Mateta, especially if they are already in your team. \nNo need to sell, hard to predict if any will be rested for the FA Cup and all three have haul potential. Eze could have had three goals last week, for example, but for a very tight offside call and missed penalty.\nDefence was nearly a debacle, with a combined four points from four players - but Kieran Trippier's 12-pointer saved the day.\nJacob Murphy (19 points) was the star man but 70 points is still disappointing for a double gameweek.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, \u00a35.5m\nWilliam Saliba, Arsenal, \u00a36.5m\nBoth face Ipswich (a) and Crystal Palace (h)\nThe two most reliable Arsenal defensive assets in a week where they could easily get two clean sheets. Boring, I know, but very steady.\nVirgil van Dijk, Liverpool, \u00a36.6m - Leicester (a)\nLeicester scored last week but lost their previous eight games without scoring. The most nailed-on clean sheet shout this week.\nHe's a better pick than a double option from Palace - see above - and Villa who have three clean sheets in their past four games, but are unlikely to get one this week.\nJosko Gvardiol, Manchester City, \u00a36.2m - Everton (a), Villa (h)\nThe Croatian has 16 points in his past three games and you can't turn down this double gameweek. He's City's best defensive asset as we all know.\nThis video can not be played\nNo-shows & Bench Boost woes\nBukayo Saka (captain), Arsenal, \u00a310.5m - Ipswich (a), Palace (h)\nFor the reasons stated above, I'd be confident about Saka's minutes this week. Yes he is coming back from injury but he also needs game time to get his fitness up.\nFrom past experience, he could easily get double digits in both of these games so he gets the armband.\nMohamed Salah (vice-captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Leicester (a)\nLast gameweek was the first since week eight in which Salah's net transfers were negative. People are selling him but don't be one of them.\nAnd if you are risk averse, or worried about game time for your doublers, Salah would make a very safe captain choice.\nMorgan Rogers, Aston Villa, \u00a35.6m - Newcastle (h), Man City (a)\nTurns out it was daft to think Rogers might get a rest last week. He's become a player who starts every game for Villa. This double is not exciting for them but Rogers is the only Villa forward asset you can truly expect to start both matches and you do fancy them to score in both games.\nJarrod Bowen, West Ham, \u00a37.5m - Southampton (h)\nThis match-up is too juicy to pass up for West Ham's talisman. Bowen's having a 7/10 season so far, but he still has four double-digit hauls.\nIn his past six games he has had 17 shots, 12 in the box. Bowen usually overperforms his expected goals (xG) yet he has just one goal in that time from 1.4 xG, suggesting he might be due.\nEberechi Eze, Crystal Palace, \u00a36.9m - Bournemouth (h), Arsenal (a)\nAs the week draws closer, I'm becoming more and more convinced Palace boss Oliver Glasner rests some key players in the Arsenal match, with little to play for in the league and an FA Cup semi-final four days later.\nBut Eze is still worth a punt. As mentioned above, he could have hauled in week 32 and we'd then be looking at him very differently.\nHe's Palace's key player and could very well start both matches and get brought off with 20 minutes to go.\nWest Ham's Jarrod Bowen has 16 goal involvements this season\nOmar Marmoush, Manchester City, \u00a37.3m - Everton (a), Villa (h)\nThree goals in his past four games and a great differential Triple Captain shout if you don't own Saka.\nIf you've owned and watched Marmoush play in those four games, you'll be feeling like he could have scored more and his underlying statistics back that up.\nThe Egyptian has had 18 shots, 10 on target, 10 in the box, four big chances - he is a haul waiting to happen.\nEvanilson, Bournemouth, \u00a35.8m - Crystal Palace (a)\nSince the Brazilian made his first start on his return from injury five games ago, he has led the way among strikers in almost every category.\nWolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen (5) is the only forward with more goals than Evanilson's four, but the Bournemouth man has had the most shots in the box (16), the most big chances (7) and the highest xG (4.44).\nHe can take advantage of a Palace defence that has conceded nine in the past two games.\nAlphonse Areola, West Ham, keeper, \u00a34.2m - Southampton (h)\nMax Kilman, West Ham, defender, \u00a34.3m - Southampton (h)\nIliman Ndiaye, Everton, striker, \u00a35.2m - Manchester City (h)\nJan Bednarek, Southampton, defender, \u00a34m - West Ham (a)\n\nTeal total cost: \u00a399.9m\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\nJust the 18 goals and three assists for Chris Wood this season.

        "article_text": "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.\nBut slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate. \nChina has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.\nThe move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.\nThis week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war? \n\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.\nMost are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.\nAlthough you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.\nFor instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.\nYttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.\nRare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.\nChina has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.\nThat means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.\nBoth the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting. \nAll rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.\n\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.\nBut China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.\nIn a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\". \n\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.\n\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"\nIn response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector. \nThese are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.\nFrom 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.\nThat is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".\nAccording to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.\nA US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.\nThis means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.\nHeavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.\nA CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.\nIt adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".\n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.\nAnd it's not only in the field of defence.\nUS manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.\n\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.\n\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies. \nIf such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".\nAnd it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals. \n\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.\n\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"\nThe US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.\nThere used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.\nBut these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.\nThis is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.\nAnother place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements. \nTrump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it. \nThese might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.\n\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper. \n\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\"",

        "article_text": "As a Brit, I didn't learn about the American Revolution in school. But my children all grew up in the US \u2013 and they did. And I noticed that while the Civil War is often portrayed in all its violence and gruesomeness, stories from the revolution focus on heroism.\nWhen I think of the American Revolution, my mind conjures images of impassioned colonists dumping tea into Boston Harbour. Paul Revere's midnight ride through Massachusetts. George Washington crossing the Delaware River. America united, alone and in the right.\u00a0\nBut 250 years since the war began, it's time for a different, more complex look at America's origin story. I recently spoke with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Rick Atkinson about the realities of the Revolutionary War that often go overlooked. His latest book on the conflict, The Fate of the Day, comes out later this month on 29 April.\nIt was an eye-opening discussion that taught me a lot \u2013 you can watch or read our conversation here:\nBelow are excerpts from the above conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nKatty Kay: It wasn't until recently that I really became aware just of how gruesome the Revolutionary War was. One in 10 Americans who fought in it died, as you recount in your book. The stories from the Battles of Saratoga of 16- and 17-year-olds freezing to death in the fields. I was wondering why you felt it was important to tell that side of the story in your books.\nRick Atkinson: The revolution has kind of a faded lithograph quality to it. The blood has been leached out, but it was a terribly bloody affair. There were at least 25,000 Americans, maybe as many as 35-40,000, who died. That's a larger proportion of the American population at the time to die in any of our wars other than the Civil War. I think the reason that it hasn't been acknowledged to be the bloody affair that it was is in part because of distance. 250 years of distance makes it hard to really feel an emotional connection to the dead. The Civil War, for instance, has photographs of the dead at places like Gettysburg and Antietam. There's none of that in the revolution.\u00a0\nKK: I can see why there was a need in the Revolutionary War to build up the founding fathers into almost Greek gods. Do you think they were sort of put on a pedestal because America needed that as the kind of launch pad of its narrative?\nRA: Yeah, I think that's true. When you've been through an ordeal like the eight-year revolution was, there's a natural sense of believing that those are demigods who managed to win through. But George Washington had feet of clay like all of us do. He had almost 600 slaves at Mount Vernon during his lifetime. It is an awful reminder that the prosperity of this country was largely predicated on bondage.\u00a0\nThe propagandists who were running this country at the time were so effective as propagandists that they had really portrayed the British as evildoers, even though there were atrocities committed by both sides. If you were a loyalist in this country, you were subject to expropriation, jail without a bond, torture and sometimes even execution. We kind of whitewashed that part of the revolution for years, decades, centuries even. We haven't fully acknowledged it, I think, even today.\u00a0\nKK: One thing that you make very clear is that there weren't just two sides in the Revolutionary War; there were actually many sides. There were Americans who didn't want to be independent. Americans who just didn't want to fight. Americans who thought of themselves as British. Benjamin Franklin's own son didn't want independence. Again, I come back to the idea that the story is muddier, perhaps, than we were told for a couple of centuries.\nRA: It makes it a much more interesting story. Benjamin Franklin's beloved son, William, was the royal governor of New Jersey. He got the job partly through his father's influence. And he just refused to buy into the notion that rebellion was legitimate. And he went to jail and eventually into exile. You multiply that by thousands and you see families split apart the same way they were in the Civil War.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Civil War qualities of the revolution extend in other ways. The Six Nations of the Iroquois had gotten along very well for more than a century. And the revolution forces them to choose sides. Four of them align with the British and two with the rebels \u2013 and they're killing each other.\u00a0\nThis is one of the aspects of the revolution that I think has not been fully appreciated by us in our history: the extent to which the war was not just between us and them, but us and us \u2013 on several levels.\u00a0\nKK: I was talking to historian and filmmaker Ken Burns recently about the revolution and he compared the intense divisions in the colonies to South Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. I'm wondering whether you feel that understanding all the muddiness and complexity of the revolution makes the war feel more relevant to a modern audience.\u00a0\nRA: I think when you look at America in 2025 and see these fractious people, you can follow that thread right back to the beginning of the origins of the country. We are a fractious people. We are a bellicose people. We are a violent people. It's not easy to acknowledge. We like to think of ourselves as peacemakers and a force for good, but that is not the only thing we are. I think that understanding who those people were and how difficult they could be at times can help us to reconcile ourselves with the people we are 250 years later.\u00a0\nKK: I also think there can often be this origin-story idea that America did it mostly alone in the Revolutionary War. But your book starts with Benjamin Franklin asking for support from the French. Was that sense of doing it alone something that you were conscious of revisiting when you wrote the book?\u00a0\nRA: Yeah, because otherwise it's not a true story. We don't win the war in 1783 without the French. Franklin's job is to persuade Louis XVI that France \u2013 an absolute monarchy, a Catholic monarchy \u2013 should throw in its lot with Protestant, rebellious, Republican wannabes.\u00a0\nKK: Okay, put like that, I see the diplomatic challenge.\nRA: It took him years! But he was very gifted, and he persuaded the French that joining the war was in their best interest, because the French had grievances against the British. And then, the Spanish come in with support. And then, the Dutch come in. America needed help; that's an important part of the story. When we give a thumb in the eye to our closest friends today, we should remember that we've needed those friends in the past. We will need them again in the future. It's a lesson directly from American wars in the past, starting with the revolution. Winston Churchill said that the only thing worse than fighting with allies is fighting without them.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

The motive remains unclear. \nThe deceased were not students, campus police said, but their identities have not been released. The suspect, who is in custody,  was shot by police and taken to hospital. \nA shotgun was also found at the scene, police said. \nThe suspect was a \"longstanding member\" of the sheriff office's youth advisory council and was engaged in a number of training programmes, Sheriff Walt McNeil said.\n\"So it is not a surprise that he had access to weapons,\" he said.\nDuring a press conference Thursday, Phoenix Ikner was identified as the son of Jessica Ikner, however Florida court documents indicate that the suspect has a different biological mother and was largely raised by his father and stepmother.\nThe suspect is the stepson of a veteran Leon County police officer who is a model employee, said Sheriff McNeil. Jessica Ikner, a school resource officer, kept the gun after the force upgraded its weapons, he said.\nPolice responded to an active shooter call at around midday local time, the university said. An alert was issued warning students and those on campus to \"seek shelter and await further instructions\".\n\"One of my classmates got an alert on her phone and announced it to the rest of the class,\" student Ava Arenado told CBS News Miami.\nAnother student, Blake Leonard, told CBS he initially heard roughly 12 shots fired.\n\"In my head, I thought it was construction at first, until I looked behind me and saw people running from the union towards my direction, and then I heard another 12 or 15 shots go off, so I started running away from there too,\" he said.\nThe FSU student newspaper quoted the suspect commenting on a rally on campus, which spoke out against President Donald Trump's policies and Israel's war in Gaza, among other things.\nFSUNews.com said Mr Ikner, who was registered to vote as a Republican, commented about anti-Trump protesters:  \"These people are usually pretty entertaining, usually not for good reasons.\"\nThe quote was removed from the story on Thursday with an editor's note saying the outlet did not wish to amplify the suspect's voice.\nPresident Donald Trump, who said he was briefed on the incident before meeting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White House, was asked whether he wanted to change gun regulations in light of the shooting.\nHe said he was a \"big advocate\" of the Second Amendment in the US Constitution, which protects gun rights.\n\"I have been since the beginning,\" he said. \"I have protected it. These things are terrible. We will have more to say about it later.\" \nHe called the shooting \"a shame, a horrible thing\".\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said: \"Our prayers are with our FSU family and state law enforcement is actively responding.\"\nThis is not the first shooting at FSU.

        "article_text": "A Maryland man who the Trump administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador has been moved to a new prison, US Senator Chris Van Hollen has said.\nThe Democratic senator was speaking after returning from El Salvador where he met Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, who was sent to the notorious mega-jail Cecot (Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism) last month.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"traumatised\" and fearful of other prisoners while inside the facility, Van Hollen said, adding that he was moved to another facility in the country over a week ago.\nThe Supreme Court has ordered the government to \"facilitate\" his return, however Trump administration officials have continued to push back against the order.\nThe White House accuses him of being a member of the transnational Salvadoran gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, and has said he will not return to the US. \nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has never been convicted of a crime. His family and attorneys have fiercely denied he is a member of MS-13. \nChris Van Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities. Later, he said government officials helped facilitate a meeting and Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was brought to the senator's hotel.\n\"His conversation with me was the first communication that he had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted,\" Van Hollen said.\n\"He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes.\"\nVan Hollen added that conditions in the new prison, in the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana, were better.\n\"He still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's case is part of a simmering showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts system on the issue of immigration. \nA separate feud has been brewing after a judge said he could hold the Trump administration in contempt for its \"wilful disregard\" of his order barring deportation flights. \nMultiple judges - including a unanimous US Supreme Court ruling - said the government should facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return to the US. But the White House has insisted the Maryland man will \"never\" live in the US again.\n\"If he [Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda] ever ends up back in the United States, he would immediately be deported again,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters at the White House Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"not a very innocent guy\".\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has faced at least two other allegations of criminal activity, neither of which resulted in a conviction.\nHis wife alleged in a 2021 protective order request that he'd physically attacked her on multiple occasions, according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.\nJennifer Vasquez Sura decided not to follow through with the court process, saying she and her husband were \"able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counselling\".\nA separate incident was reported in 2022, when Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was pulled over in Tennessee for allegedly speeding. \nAn officer speculated that he was involved in human trafficking, due to him having multiple people in the car and telling authorities he'd been travelling from Texas to Maryland, according to information shared by the Department of Homeland Security that was obtained by the BBC's partner CBS. \nNo criminal case was launched from the incident. His wife said he \"worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites\". \nAt the heart of the case, though, are the allegations of his involvement in MS-13, which the Trump administration used to expel him under the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president has evoked the law to deport hundreds so far, by arguing the alleged gang members were terrorists. \nSen Van Hollen said the Trump administration wants to \"flat out lie about what this case is about\". \n\"If you want to make claims about \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, you should present them in the courts, not on social media,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was arrested by immigration authorities on 12 March in Baltimore, before being deported from Texas to El Salvador on 15 March.

Chris Van Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities. Multiple judges - including a unanimous US Supreme Court ruling - said the government should facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return to the US. Sen Van Hollen said the Trump administration wants to \"flat out lie about what this case is about\".",

        "article_text": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.\nIn the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.\n- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you\u2019re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.\n- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.\nDees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Since then, Slot has almost reverted to a certain team and they are starting to look a bit tired, and far more vulnerable.\nI am certainly not criticising Slot, because to do what he has done with a team he has inherited is still incredible, but I feel he knows he needs to strengthen and that we will see the difference next season when he has the squad depth he wants.\nEven when Liverpool have looked heavy-legged, Slot has hardly given a sniff to Elliott or Federico Chiesa in midfield or up front. He either doesn't trust them, or feels they are not suited to his system.\nIt's the same with Jarell Quansah. He was on the bench against Fulham but, when Konate came off, Ryan Gravenberch dropped back to centre-half instead.\nWhatever the reason, it feels almost a case where Slot is getting across the line using this squad this season, and there are going to be wholesale changes in the summer.\nIt makes what he has done in such a short space of time even more impressive, especially handling the contract issues of three of his biggest stars at the same time too.\nStephen Warnock was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThis video can not be played\nIt's the hardest time to work in the Premier League - Slot",

        "article_text": "She jets around the world for her high-profile beauty career, but her heart is in Seoul. Here are her top K-beauty experiences in town, from face lasers to body scrubs.\nFor Chriselle Lim \u2013 style guru, digital creator and creative director of PHLUR fragrances \u2013 self-care is a way of life. Especially when she visits South Korea, the birthplace of the viral \"K-beauty\"\u2013 \u00a0beloved for its multi-layer \"glass skin\" skincare regimens and high-tech sun creams.\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Chriselle Lim)\nChriselle Lim is a Korean American fashion stylist, entrepreneur and digital influencer. She founded the fashion and lifestyle blog The Chriselle Factor in 2011, leading to collaborations with luxury brands including Dior and Chanel.\n\"Beauty and self-care in Korea is a daily thing,\" says the fresh-faced and flawlessly stylish Lim, who spent her formative years in the glamorous South Korean capital and returns with her daughters each year. \"It's not about hitting a certain age and then taking care of your skin. You just do it since you're a very young girl. As we're trying to reverse [sun damage] here in the States, in Korea, the women have been taught to protect themselves early on. We were always embarrassed about our moms taking us around in their crazy massive sun hats and their gloves. But now I get it. I've become that lady.\"\nWhile innovative Korean products like collagen sheet masks continue to dominate the international market, Korea is also seeing an uptick in beauty tourism. Consumers can visit \"skin clinics\" for medical aesthetic treatments powered by ultra-modern Korean technologies; often not yet approved by the FDA. Adding to the appeal, patients can get several treatments \u2013 from Botox to Titanium skin lifting to liquid laser sun spot removal \u2013 in one sitting with jaw-dropping transformations and little downtime \u2013 compared to Western protocols, which require patients wait 28 days between treatments.\u00a0\n\"I have a lot of followers that ask me for tips and where to go,\" says Lim. \"It makes a lot of sense. One, the technology is there. And two, it's so much cheaper [than the US], at least by five times. The flight there, renting an Airbnb or a hotel; it actually makes a lot of sense because you are saving money in the long run.\"\nNot that Lim ever needs a reason to visit Seoul. \"It's a fast-paced city that is extremely clean, chic, sophisticated,\" she says. \"Just imagine fashion and art and beauty all combined in one. It's one of those places I go whenever I'm feeling like I need inspiration.\"\nHere is Lim's go-to plan for a self-care holiday in Seoul.\nGangnam, the stylish district made world-famous by a certain 2012 K-pop song, is considered Seoul's K-beauty and medical tourism hot spot\u00a0 \u2013 and it's where Lim's self-care holidays start. First stop: Eun Skin Clinic in the affluent Cheongdam neighbourhood, south of the Han River.\nTip:\n\"A tip that people don't realise when planning is that you have to see what side of the river [Han] these places are and try to plan accordingly,\" says Lim. \"Because crossing that river can take so long; traffic is really bad, so you have to figure out the subway system or try to plan everything out in advance.\"\n\"They do incredible lasers, the best I've experienced,\" says Lim. \"They speak really good English there, which is a big make or break for me because I'm not fluent in Korean. And because [the doctor] deals with a lot of English-speaking people, I think she realises that a lot of them are here to explore and have fun, so she doesn't want to be so aggressive with their face. They do a very customised approach.\"\nKorean skin lasers, notes Lim, are so gentle they can even be layered on top of each other to compound their transformative effects.\u00a0\n\"It's very, very gentle,\" says Lim of her most recent visit. \"I did something called Ruby toning; helps with even skin tone and brightening. And there's another laser that I did called MeDioStar\u00ae, which is brightening and tightening. And then on top of that, I did PRP [platelet-rich plasma treatment]. And then I also did microneedling and then salmon DNA. It takes maybe an hour and a half to do.\"\nShe cautions:\u00a0 \"The next day, if you get five to eight treatments, your skin will be slightly bruised, but it goes away within, I would say, 48 hours. [These lasers are] effective on the deeper surface level, but on the topical level, you can't really tell that you've gotten anything done\u2026 But then after I went home, and people were like, 'Wait, did you, did you do something to your face? ' And you're like, 'Okay, I think it's kicking in'.\"\nLim recommends visitors hit skin clinics at the beginning of their trip \u2013 \"first thing when they land\u2026 because these clinics like to check up on you after three-to-five days. During that downtime, you could do coffee and check out some incredible museums and do some shopping.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.eunskin.co.kr/\nAddress: 88-37 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +\n82 2 546 3322\nInstagram: @eunskinclinic/\nAs part of her downtime from skin procedures, Lim also likes to indulge in relaxing body treatments.\nTip:\nAs exciting as high tech and holistic body treatments may be, the traditional Korean spa experience happens at the jjimjilbang; the public bathhouse. \"Bathhouses in Korea are really interesting,\" says Lim. \"People go there to meet their friends, hang out and eat. They even go there after hours, after the club to detox the alcohol and sweat it out. It's fascinating; they don't really go there for the experience; it's to hang out with their friends.\"\n\"There's this spa called Gogyeol,\" says Lim. \"I love this place to reset my body. They do a traditional Korean massage and scrub.\"\nLike Eun Skin Clinic, Spa Gogyeol is found in Cheongdam; a two-minute walk from the Gangnam-Gu Office metro station. Lim notes that Spa Gogyeol is a not a jjimjilbang (a public Korean bathhouse). \"A lot of people love Korean bathhouses [because] they do this intensive scrub where they literally scrub off all the dead cells off your skin and it just comes purging off your body. It's pretty disgusting. But [Spa Gogyeol does] that treatment in a private setting, so you can get the body scrub, the upgrade massage and a detox wrap. They literally scrub off every dead skin cell on your body, and it just feels so soft. You feel like you're floating.\"\nSpa Gogyeol also offers a rich menu of holistic medical treatments, working with the body's five Tae energies. \"In Korean health, a lot of it is about balance,\" says Lim. \"So they'll really analyse your body to see what they need to focus on, and they'll customise it for you.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of people that are on holiday just want to relax,\" she adds. \"A lot of tired mamas. It's a very calming space.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://spa-gogyeol.com/\nAddress: 3F&4F, 13, Seolleung-ro 132-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea \nPhone: +82 10-7682-1297\nInstagram: @spa_gogyeol\nWhere Eun Skin Clinic is expressly high tech and Spa Gogyeol takes a holistic approach, Lim's next spa pick \u2013 Trinity Spa in Seoul's Yongsan District \u2013\u00a0 is all about pampering and beautification.\nWhen to go\n\"Springtime is beautiful, but autumn is also stunning,\" says Lim. \"I would say a five-day trip would be incredible. There's so much to see in Korea, but even a three-day trip is worth it, just because, again, that the value that you're getting for these treatments are you getting the bang for your buck.\"\n\"It's a little tricky with Trinity spa because their English isn't the best,\" says Lim. \"But I think they're working on it. They're more of a general spa; that's why I feel okay recommending it. They do everything from amazing facials, really focussing on lifting the face and focussing on your lines, and brightening and tightening to body contouring, massages. They cover it all.\"\nTrinity Spa's array of facial and body treatments toe the line between technology and relief \u2013 like the Real Jade Stone V-line jaw contour treatment or the lymphatic drainage leg massages \u2013 all administered in private guest rooms with cushy spa beds designed for ultimate relaxation.\u00a0\n\"It's just a very relaxing experience for someone that wants a general spa experience,\" says Lim.\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.trinityspa.co.kr/\nAddress: 3rd floor, Taeseok Building 116 Dokseodang-ro, Hannam-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-420-0797\nInstagram: \n@the_trinityspa_official/\nThe Korean skincare craze began in the early 2010s; global cosmetic purveyor Sephora's website now features a K-beauty section and Lim herself often provides K-beauty product recommendations on social media.\nSo when in Korea, shop as the Koreans do.\n\"Everyone needs to go to Amorepacific World Headquarters,\" declares Lim. Known as the inventor of the cushion foundation, Amorepacific now also owns many popular Korean skincare companies including Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Cosrx and Laneige. \"It's open to the public, which a lot of people don't know,\" says Lim. \"In their lobby, you can get your face scanned; a lot of people go there to get their cushion foundation customised\u2026 they have a beauty store in their lobby, so you can experience all of their brands at once. [There's also] an interactive Amorepacific store called AMORE Seongsu. It's in this warehouse-y cement building; it's like you're walking through a store, but with a bathroom installation in front of you while you try things. Everything is technology-driven; you can get customised lip treatments, customised foundation. I could spend hours there.\"\u00a0\nLim adds: \"There's also the Sulwhasoo flagship store, which is just beautiful in itself.\"\nSulwhasoo, a luxury skin line, is headquartered in Seoul's upscale shopping district Sinsa-dong, in a modular structure channelling a golden lantern. \"The shopping is great, and it looks like you're entering an installation,\" says Lim. \"It has two spas. You could have, like, a foot scrub [or] a therapist with the singing bowl around your abdomen.\"\nLim also enjoys shopping for her favourite Korean brands at Olive Young. \"It's the Sephora of Korea,\" she says. \"They're on every corner. But the key thing is to know which one to go to. There's one in Myeongdong, which is the largest. Then the newest one is in Seongsu and it's a lot more tech-driven.\" Apart from beauty shopping, the five-storey Olive Young in Seongsu houses a cafe and a skin and scalp clinic as well as professional makeup services and a \"trend pod\" showroom. \"Olive Young can be slightly outdated depending which one you go to,\" says Lim. \"But this one feels like the future of what Olive Young will be.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.apgroup.com/int/en/our-culture/amorepacific-space/amorepacific-headquarters/amorepacific-headquarters.html (Amorepacific World Headquarters)\nAddress: 100 Hangang-daero, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-604-05114\nInstagram: \n@amorepacificgroup.official/\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.amoremall.com/kr/ko/store/display?storeCode=001 (Amorepacific Seongsu)\nAddress: 7 Achasan-ro 11-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-469-8600\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.sulwhasoo.com/int/en/flagship/dosan/index.html (Sulwhasoo flagship)\nAddress: 18 Dosan-daero 45-gil, Sinsa-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2-541-9270\nInstagram: \n@sulwhasoo.official/\nWebsite: \nhttps://global.oliveyoung.com/ (Olive Young Seongsu)\nAddress: 300-65 Seongsu-dong 2(i)-ga, Seongdong-gu, SeoulPhone:  +82 2-461-5290\nInstagram: @oliveyoung_global/\nTo cap off a day of beauty, Lim heads straight for the hair salon. \"This is actually quite common in Korea,\" she says. \"After you get all your skin treatments, you go get your hair done.\"\nLim favours ABYBOM, a massive, three-storey salon on Seolleung-ro that boasts a client roster of Korean celebs like Sandara Park. \"A lot of people that go to events get the full service of hair and makeup done,\" says Lim. \"They do amazing cuts. They style, they detoxify your scalp, if needed. They're incredible.\"\u00a0\nAfterwards, Lim always likes to visit a caf\u00e9. \"Caf\u00e9 life in Korea is so major,\" she says. \"Between caf\u00e9s and skin, you will never see the end of day.\" One of her favourite stops is inside the Dosan Park Gentle Monster branch; 35 minutes outside of Seoul proper. \"Gentle Monster is a sunglass brand; they have the coolest shops ever,\" says Lim. \"It's like an art installation. Then downstairs, there is a cafe called Nudake; they have conceptual coffees and baked goods.\"\nNudake Caf\u00e9 proffers its coffees and whimsical pastries on stark countertops, like modern art displays. \"It sounds so ridiculous, but they have these tiny, tiny, tiny, miniature croissants,\" says Lim. \"They're literally the size of your pinky nail bed, but it's so good, and it's just so fun to take a photo with. [And] they have incredible coffee. It's actually quite hard to find non-dairy milks, but they have non-dairy milk there. So that's personally the reason why I like to go to that caf\u00e9, to just get my lattes without dairy milk.\"\u00a0\n\"There's a lot of things that we have been doing in Korea that I feel like the world is finally noticing,\" adds Lim. \"It's something that I'm very proud of.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.abybom.com/\nAddress: 3\n\uce35\n, 40 Seolleung-ro 152-gil, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: + 82-2-516-8765\nInstagram: \n@abybom__official/reels/ \nWebsite: \nhttps://nudake.com/en\nAddress: 26 Seongsui-ro 7-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-7-041-284408\nInstagram: \n@nu_dake/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

His administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nTrump has also ended a duty-free exemption for goods worth less than $800, which helped Shein and Temu make rapid inroads to the US market.\nUS lawmakers on both sides had raised concerns about how these companies had \"exploited\" the provision.  \nAn estimated 1.4 billion packages entered the US under this arrangement last year, up from 140 million in 2013, according to US customs authorities.\nSince Trump started imposing the tariffs, Shein and Temu have seen the ranking of their apps fall sharply.\nTemu is now the 75th most downloaded free app on the US Apple Store, after having consistently taken one of the top five spots in the last two years.

An estimated 1.4 billion packages entered the US under this arrangement last year, up from 140 million in 2013, according to US customs authorities.Since Trump started imposing the tariffs, Shein and Temu have seen the ranking of their apps fall sharply.Temu is now the 75th most downloaded free app on the US Apple Store, after having consistently taken one of the top five spots in the last two years. In their statements, Temu and Shein encouraged customers to shop before higher prices kick in. His administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.Trump has also ended a duty-free exemption for goods worth less than $800, which helped Shein and Temu make rapid inroads to the US market.US lawmakers on both sides had raised concerns about how these companies had \"exploited\" the provision.",

        "article_text": "When US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in his first term, Vietnamese entrepreneur Hao Le saw an opportunity.\nHis company is one of hundreds of businesses that have emerged to compete with Chinese exports that have increasingly been facing restrictions from the West.\nLe's SHDC Electronics, which sits in the budding industrial hub of Hai Duong, sells $2m (\u00a31.5m) worth of phone and computer accessories every month to the US. \nBut that revenue could dry up if Trump imposes 46% tariffs on Vietnamese goods, a plan that is currently on hold until early July.  That would be \"catastrophic for our business,\" Le says. \nAnd selling to Vietnamese consumers is not an option, he adds: \"We cannot compete with Chinese products. This is not just our challenge. Many Vietnamese companies are struggling in their own home market.\"\nTrump tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers. But they also opened new doors for other businesses, often into global supply chains that wanted to cut their dependence on China.   \nBut Trump 2.0 threatens to shut those doors. And that's a blow for fast-growing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia that are gunning to be key players in industries from chips to electric vehicles.\nThey also find themselves stuck between the world's two biggest economies - China, a powerful neighbour and their biggest trading partner, and the US, a key export market, which could be looking to strike a deal at Beijing's expense.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has been visiting Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week, urging unity against Trump's tariffs. The trip was long planned but has fresh urgency given how significant South East Asia is to the Chinese economy. \nChina earned a record $3.5tn from exports in 2024 - 16% of its exports go to South East Asia, making it the biggest market. \n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC on Tuesday, ahead of Xi's visit.\n\"If the issue is about something that we feel is against our interest, then we will protect [ourselves].\"\nIn the days after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs, South East Asian governments scrambled into deal-making mode.\nIn what Trump described as a \"very productive call\" with Vietnamese leader To Lam, the latter offered to completely scrap tariffs on US goods. \nThe US market is crucial to Vietnam, an emerging electronics powerhouse where manufacturing giants like Samsung, Intel and Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm contracted to make iPhones, have set up shop.\nMeanwhile, Thai officials are headed to Washington with a plan that includes higher US imports and investments. The US is their largest export market, so they are hoping to avoid the 36% levy on Thailand that Trump may reinstate.\n\"We will tell the US government that Thailand is not only an exporter but also an ally and economic partner that the US can rely on in the long term,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has ruled out retaliation against Trump's tariffs, instead choosing to emphasise their economic and political importance to the US.\n\"We understand the concerns of the US,\" Mr Zafrul told the BBC. \"That's why we need to show that actually we, Asean, especially Malaysia, can be that bridge.\"\nIt's a role that South East Asia's export-driven economies have played well - they have benefitted from both Chinese and US trade and investment. But Trump's paused levies could derail that. \nIndonesia, which could face 32% tariffs, is home to vast nickel reserves and has its sights set on the global electric vehicle supply chain. Malaysia, which is gearing up to be a semiconductor hub, could be hit with 24% tariffs.\nCambodia, a Chinese ally, faces the steepest levies: 49%.  One of the poorest countries in the region, it has thrived as a trans-shipment hub for Chinese businesses seeking to skirt US tariffs. Chinese businesses currently own or operate 90% of the clothes factories, which mainly export to the US.\nTrump may have hit pause on these tariffs but \"the damage is done,\" says Doris Liew, an economist at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.\n\"This serves as a wake-up call for the region, not only to reduce reliance on the US, but also to re-balance overdependence on any single trade and export partner.\"\nIn these uncertain times , Xi Jinping is tyring to send a steadfast message: Let's join hands and resist \"bullying\" from the US.\nThat is no easy task because South East Asia also has trade tensions with Beijing. \nIn Indonesia, business owner Isma Savitri is worried that Trump's 145% tariffs on China means more competition from Chinese rivals who can no longer export to the US. \n\"Small businesses like us feel squeezed,\" says the owner of sleepwear brand Helopopy. \"We are struggling to survive against an onslaught of ultra-cheap Chinese products.\"\nOne of Helopopy's popular pyjamas sells for $7.10 (119,000 Indonesian rupiah). Isma says she has seen similar designs from China going for around half that price.\n\"South East Asia, being close by, with open trade regimes and fast-growing markets, naturally became the dumping ground,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"Politically, many countries are reluctant to confront Beijing, which adds another layer of vulnerability.\"\nWhile consumers have welcomed competitively-priced Chinese products - from clothes to shoes to phones - thousands of local businesses have not been able to match such low prices.\nMore than 100 factories in Thailand have closed every month for the last two years, according to an estimate from a Thai think tank. During the same period in Indonesia, around 250,000 textile workers were laid off after some 60 garment manufacturers shut, local trade associations say  - including Sritex, once the region's largest textile maker.\n\"When we see the news, there are lots of imported products flooding the domestic market, which messes up our own market,\" Mujiati, a worker who was laid off from Sritex in February after 30 years, tells the BBC.\n\"Maybe it just wasn't our luck,\" says the 50-year-old, who is still hunting for work. \"Who can we complain to? There's no-one.\"\nSouth East Asian governments responded with a wave of protectionism, as local businesses demanded to be shielded from the impact of Chinese imports.\nLast year Indonesia considered 200% tariffs on a range of Chinese goods and blocked e-commerce site Temu, popular among Chinese merchants. Thailand tightened inspections of imports and imposed additional tax on goods worth less than 1,500 Thai baht ($45; \u00a334).\nThis year Vietnam has twice imposed temporary anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel products. And after Trump's latest tariffs announcement, Vietnam is reportedly set to crack down on Chinese goods being trans-shipped via its territory to the US.\nAllaying these fears would have been on Xi's agenda this week. \nChina is concerned that channelling its US-bound exports to the rest of the world would \"end up really alienating and aggravating\" its trading partners, David Rennie, the former Beijing bureau chief for the Economist newspaper, told BBC's Newshour.\n\"If a tidal wave of Chinese exports ends up swamping those markets and damaging employment and jobs \u2026 that's a massive diplomatic and geopolitical headache for the Chinese leadership.\"\nChina has not always had an easy relationship with this region. Barring Laos, Cambodia and a war-torn Myanmar, the others are wary of Beijing's ambitions. Terrirorial disputes in the South China have soured ties with the Philippines. This is also an issue with others such as Vietnam and Malaysia, but trade has been a balancing factor. \nBut that might change now, experts say. \n\"South East Asia had to think about whether they really wanted to offend China. Now this complicates things,\" says Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore. \nChina's loss could be South East Asia's gain. \nHao Le, in Vietnam, says he has seen a surge in enquiries from American customers scouting for new electronics suppliers, outside of China: \"In the past, US buyers would take months to switch suppliers. Today, such decisions are made within days.\"\nMalaysia, with sprawling rubber plantations and the world's largest medical rubber glove maker, has nearly half the world's market for rubber gloves. But it is poised to grab a bigger share from its main competitor, China.   \nThe region still faces a 10% baseline tariff, like most of the world. And that is bad news, says Oon Kim Hung, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association. \nBut even if the paused tariffs kick in, he says, customers will find paying an additional 24% on Malaysian gloves vastly preferable to the 145% levy they will jave to cough up for Chinese-made gloves.\n\"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit our manufacturers, as well as those in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\"\nAdditional reporting by Bui Thu and Tessa Wong",

        "article_text": "As museums around the world celebrate the 250th birthday of JMW Turner, it's time to reappraise his beloved and celebrated painting, The Fighting Temeraire.\nJMW Turner's The Fighting Temeraire became a national celebrity when it was first unveiled in 1839, and its fame has endured to the present day. It was once voted Britain's favourite painting\u00a0and currently features on \u00a320 banknotes. But the widely accepted interpretation of this iconic painting's message might, in fact, contradict Turner's true intentions.\nThe \"Temeraire\" of the title refers to a 98-gun warship of the British Navy, which is depicted in the painting's background. It was a hero in Britain's defence against France during the Napoleonic Wars, but it caught the nation's attention in 1838 when it was dismantled and its parts sold off. Turner's painting depicts this once-mighty gladiator of the seas being towed down a burnished River Thames by a much more recently invented steam-powered tugboat.\nA brief segment in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall captures a popular view about the painting. In the scene, Bond (Daniel Craig) meets Q (Ben Whishaw), his new head of research and development, in London's National Gallery, and they sit in front of The Fighting Temeraire. \"It always makes me feel a little melancholy\", says the young, tech-savvy Q, in a pointed jibe to 007, an old-school field agent. \"A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap.\"\nThis echoes the widely held belief that the painting evokes a sense of nostalgia and faded national glory. According to this view, the ghostly Temeraire is the painting's heroine, and the tugboat its villain. In the 19th Century, the English writer William Makepeace Thackeray referred to the smaller vessel as \"a little, spiteful, diabolical steamer\" and the American novelist Herman Melville called it \"a pygmy steam-tug\" by comparison to the \"Titan Temeraire\".\nYou can see why Turner's original audience may have sympathised with the humbled HMS Temeraire and been saddened by her fate. Back in 1804, she had played a critical role in blockading French ports and defending the British coast. But her finest moment came on the afternoon of 21 October 1805, in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of south-west Spain.\nAt this pivotal hour, the Battle of Trafalgar, a deadly sea battle between the British Royal Navy and the combined fleets of Spain and France, was at its climax. Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory had led the attack but was being pummelled by the French vessel Redoubtable. Then, out of the cannon smoke, surged HMS Temeraire, followed by a war-hungry flotilla of British vessels. The Temeraire blasted the Redoubtable with her guns and endured a hailstorm of cannon volleys in return \u2013 an onslaught that lacerated the ship and spattered her decks with blood. But like a stalwart prize-fighter, the Temeraire weathered the bout. She valiantly protected her flagship and played a vital part in the British navy's ultimate victory in the Battle of Trafalgar.\nTurner was 64 when he painted The Fighting Temeraire. He was born in 1775 in a down-at-heel area of London near Covent Garden but managed to enrol at the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts aged 14. He became an Academician at the precocious age of 24, and a Professor of Perspective when he was just 32. But although he rubbed shoulders with the great and the good, he refused to soften his Cockney accent or refine his manners. He was also fiercely entrepreneurial \u2013 he opened his own private gallery, sought wealthy patrons, and was always on the lookout for captivating and lucrative new artistic projects that might have widespread appeal. On one level, The Fighting Temeraire achieves his desire for broad popularity by harnessing people's sense of national pride.\nBut there's an even more important message to learn from the painting than its patriotism and sentimentality. It concerns that much maligned tugboat: the true focal point of the painting.\u00a0 \u00a0\nSteam power was the new mechanical wonder of Turner's age, and his attitude to this recent technology was much more complicated than Thackeray, Melville or Q recognised. In other Turner artworks, like Snow Storm \u2013 Steam-Boat (1842) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844), you can see his fascination with modern machinery and its transformative influence on individual experience, the environment, and society as a whole. This is in stark contrast with Turner's great rival John Constable, whose parents were from the elite, and whose paintings tended to overlook some of the most seismic changes that were reshaping the British Isles at the time.\nIn Constable's iconic 1821 painting The Hay Wain, an archaic cart rolls gently away from the viewer into a bucolic English landscape. Turner's The Fighting Temeraire gives us the exact opposite, putting the spectator on a collision course with the unstoppable force of industry.\nThis reflected contemporary reality. At the time The Fighting Temeraire was painted, the Royal Navy was increasingly using steamboats for towing bigger vessels. Moves were already afoot to replace its sail-powered fleet with new steam frigates. But the demise of the Temeraire didn't reflect a routine upgrade in armaments. This was a one-of-a-kind revolution in seafaring. Sailors around the world had relied on wind-and-sail or oar-propulsion for thousands of years. Now, steam engines could allow seafarers to overcome the vagaries of gusts, shallows and tidal patterns \u2013 to supersede nature itself. The future was steam-powered, but how this was going to affect the future of transport, trade and naval combat was still anybody's guess in the 1830s. What Turner did know was that as far back as Homer's Odyssey, sailing functioned as a profound symbol of the life journey in art and literature. And so, by hitching the old and the new so unforgettably in his painting, he shows us a compelling metamorphosis \u2013 the beginning of a new, post-industrial lifecycle in human history.\nTurner was awake to the responsibility of artists in times of irreversible historical change. For him, the age-old skill of depicting wooden sailing ships, their rigging, sails and ornately carved figureheads was becoming obsolete. The challenge for every artist (and every member of society) in the modern age, he realised, was to discover beauty and significance in newness, and in artefacts that had not previously been depicted in art, like iron funnels, pistons, valves, and paddle wheels. In The Fighting Temeraire, his rise to this challenge is captured in a very memorable and uncompromising symbol.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The forgotten Monet finally getting her moment\n\u2022 The schmaltzy paintings that divided the US\n\u2022 The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel \nTurner even adapted his painting technique to express the technological and social transformations in the world around him. He used newly invented paint hues like Lemon Yellow and Scarlet Lake in The Fighting Temeraire. Pigment analysis of the painting also indicates that he raided from his kitchen for substances to add his paint to achieve desired effects, like tallow, cooking fat or even salad oil.\nHis interest in new technology, and his search for innovative techniques with which to represent them, had a direct impact on the next generation of avant-garde painters. Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro were both wowed by Turner's art. An engraving of Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed (which depicts a train hurtling over Maidenhead bridge) was even displayed at the first Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1874 \u2013 a pivotal event in the history of modern art.\nIn 2025 various exhibitions will celebrate the 250th anniversary of Turner's birth, from Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool (Turner: Always Contemporary), to Turner's House in Twickenham (Turner's Kingdom: Beauty, Birds and Beasts), and from the Yale Centre for British Art, Connecticut (JMW Turner: Romance and Reality) to Tate Britain (Turner and Constable). But to fully appreciate this extraordinary artist, it's important to grasp the true meaning of his masterpiece, The Fighting Temeraire.\nFrequently it's been accepted as a melancholy image, a forlorn lament for past glories and a lost way of life. But this misses its essential point. The Fighting Temeraire is really about transformation and the inevitability of change rather than nostalgia. The most important lessons to learn from The Fighting Temeraire are about Turner's attitude and outlook. It embodies his refusal to be daunted by newness or enslaved by traditional artistic values. His quest to find the beauty and grandeur of modern experience, and leave the past behind, is magnificently on display in The Fighting Temeraire. And these qualities are truly his lasting legacy to modern art.\nThe 250th anniversary of JMW Turner's birth is on 23 April 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

On one level, The Fighting Temeraire achieves his desire for broad popularity by harnessing people's sense of national pride.By hitching the old and the new so unforgettably in his painting, he shows us a compelling metamorphosis \u2013 the beginning of a new, post-industrial lifecycle in human historyBut there's an even more important message to learn from the painting than its patriotism and sentimentality. In the 19th Century, the English writer William Makepeace Thackeray referred to the smaller vessel as \"a little, spiteful, diabolical steamer\" and the American novelist Herman Melville called it \"a pygmy steam-tug\" by comparison to the \"Titan Temeraire\".The National Gallery, LondonA common belief about Turner's The Fighting Temeraire is that it evokes a sense of faded national glory (Credit: The National Gallery, London)You can see why Turner's original audience may have sympathised with the humbled HMS Temeraire and been saddened by her fate. Turner's The Fighting Temeraire gives us the exact opposite, putting the spectator on a collision course with the unstoppable force of industry.The National Gallery, LondonWhereas John Constable depicted the British countryside as calm and picturesque, Turner embraced the changes affecting society in his art (Credit: The National Gallery, London)This reflected contemporary reality. But the widely accepted interpretation of this iconic painting's message might, in fact, contradict Turner's true intentions.The \"Temeraire\" of the title refers to a 98-gun warship of the British Navy, which is depicted in the painting's background.",

        "article_text": "From nightmares to severe backache, three people with Parkinson's have shared their symptoms and experiences to offer insight into what it is like to live a day in their shoes.\nThe progressive disorder affects the brain, nervous system, and muscle control. It is the fastest growing neurological condition in the world, with about 153,000 people in the UK living with the condition.\nAlison Anderson from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, is one of those people. Like many, she awakes at about 08:00 to the twinkling crescendo of her morning alarm. \nBut unlike many others, this sound shatters the silence six more times throughout her day, reminding her to take her medication. \nThe slightest delay in her dosage, known as off-time, risks her symptoms surfacing and her experiencing anything from tremors to memory difficulties or poor balance.\n\"When this happens, even the simplest of tasks becomes challenging,\" she said. \n\"I become mentally and physically slower, I can't think straight and struggle to speak without forgetting what I'm trying to say. \n\"It's frustrating, at times embarrassing, and it interferes with pretty much everything I'm trying to do,\" she said.\nMs Anderson was diagnosed with the condition in 2015, which at the time came as a \"devastating\" blow.\nBut over the years, she has gradually \"learned to adjust\" to her symptoms, and even discovered a \"slower pace of life\" has made her more appreciative.\nThe 54-year-old has found a close-knit community comprised of four other women with the disease, whom she meets with every week for coffee, cake and a catch-up.\n\"Because we are all facing similar challenges, we are uniquely placed to help and support each other,\" she said.\n\"We also encourage, and at times, coerce each other into trying new things and keeping active. I try to enjoy life and live it to the fullest.\"\nOther symptoms of Parkinson's can include sensory issues, voice changes, facial masking\u00a0- where people experience a reduced ability to express emotions through facial movements - and sleep difficulties. \nAs Glyn Evans from Lydney explains: \"You get distressing dreams most nights. I wake up every couple of hours, sometimes in a ball of sweat.\" \nMr Evans was diagnosed with Parkinson's tremor after noticing a slight shake in his right hand several years ago.\nThis quickly progressed to jaw and tongue tremors, stiffness, severe backache and loss of balance. \nThe 78-year-old said life continues regardless, and he has \"found ways to cope\" with the condition.\n\"What would I say to people about my condition? Don't feel sorry for me,\" he said.\n\"Try to understand that Parkinson's has changed my life but it won't kill me.\"\nMichael Pearce, from Hardwicke, told the BBC his symptoms manifest in the form of fatigue, mobility issues, tremors and urinary incontinence. \n\"I'm very self-conscious at times, frustrated and uncertain,\" he said. \"But only once or twice did I get angry about it. It's nobody's fault, it just is.\n\"The other big thing for me was I stopped being creative. I used to write songs and my sense of humour diminished. Thankfully, these are coming back.\"\nMr Pearce said prescribed medication has since improved his quality of life, but true acceptance of his diagnosis came from within. \n\"I endeavour not to worry about an unknown future,\" he explained.\n\"Parkinson's has been a wake up call about life's priorities, not taking people and things for granted.\n\"This definitely helped in my case, keeping me grounded and philosophical about the situation. I express gratitude for the things I can still do.\" \nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630.",

Humans are tired... you kind of know that your personal bias is entering in to your marking,\" he added.\nDave Costen, digital lead for Elizabeth College, said AI was not yet able to substitute for teaching.\nMr Costen said one difference was AI gave \"too much [information] to students straight away\" whereas teachers \"develop the learning [of students] gradually\".\nStudents generally have a poor understanding of AI, he said.\nDespite this, some Elizabeth College students had experimented with the technology, he said. \nOne student explained to the BBC that AI was not good at adjusting the difficulty of example questions. \nAnother student said some of their peers over-relied on AI, and used it to complete work for them, which was not helping them learn.\nAI was also better at some subjects than others, a third explained. It was very strong at coding, but in subjects that required reasoning it \"really struggled\".\nParent Gazz Barbe said he uses parental controls to restrict his daughter's phone use, and added that he did not allow the use of AI technology. \n\"I worry that if I give my daughter unrestricted access to this technology, she will use it to complete homework assignments. \n\"And if she does this in a subject that she really struggles with, she could easily become over-reliant on the technology,\" he said.\n\"The positive potential is absolutely massive... so long as it's used as a tool to assist teachers instead of doing the teaching,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

        "article_text": "After decades spent in prison by Erik and Lyle Menendez - and months of contentious court fights - a judge will hear arguments on whether the brothers should be resentenced, in a murder case that still divides America. \nThe pair are serving life in prison for killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, in 1989, when they were 21 and 18. Their case gained renewed attention after a popular Netflix series last year.\nThursday's resentencing hearing will determine whether the pair should be resentenced to a lesser penalty. If approved, the brothers could become eligible for parole - potentially allowing their freedom. \nProsecutors at the time argued Erik and Lyle meticulously planned the killings so they could access their parents' fortune. The current Los Angeles District Attorney says the brothers have continued to cling to lies about the case. \nBut the brothers' lawyers have long argued the killings were an act of self-defence and claimed their father abused them for years. They have also pointed to court filings detailing their rehabilitation during their years behind bars. \nHere is what to expect from the hearing - and a recap of how we got here.\nThe brothers shot and killed their parents with shotguns at their Beverly Hills mansion. There has long been a debate over their motive.\nProsecutors painted them during their trials as spoiled rich kids who wanted to access their parents' $14m (\u00a310.7m) fortune. They argued that the duo methodically bought shotguns and opened fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.\nThe brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered record label executive. \nThe brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.\nIt ended deadlocked, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a second trial during which the judge barred many of their claims of sexual abuse. They are imprisoned near San Diego.\nA judge will look at evidence, hear from witnesses, and ultimately determine whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced. \nIt will not be a re-trial, and guilt will not be a question. Much of the focus could instead be on what the brothers have done during their 30 years in prison. \nThe hearing - which will not be televised - will start Thursday in Los Angeles and is scheduled to also go into Friday, though it could wrap up in a single day. \nBoth sides - lawyers for the Menendez brothers and the district attorney's office - will present arguments on why the brothers should or should not be resentenced. \nThey will also be able to call people to testify. This could include a wide variety of individuals, from people involved in prosecuting the brothers in the 1990s or prison officials talking about the brothers' last 30 years behind bars. \nWe are likely to hear from members of the Menendez family, many of whom have become outspoken advocates for Erik and Lyle's release. But at least one member of the family has been a fierce critic of the effort to free them. \nMilton Anderson, who is Kitty Menendez's brother, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and has argued the pair should remain behind bars for the \"heinous act\".\nThat is unclear. If they did, it would mark a significant moment in the case, and would leave them open to questions from prosecutors who oppose their release.\nThe pair have previously appeared remotely at hearings by video link. The BBC has asked whether they will appear in person, and if they will testify. \nOn a recent episode of his podcast, lawyer Mark Geragos said he had not decided whether to call them to the stand.\n\"I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.\"\nThe district attorney's office has similarly not said who it plans to call to testify. \nAfter the two-day hearing, Los Angeles County Judge Michael Jesic will rule on whether the brothers should be resentenced. \nBut it is not clear if that will come at the conclusion of the hearing, or later.\nEven if Judge Jesic rules in favour of the brothers being resentenced, they will not be immediately released. \nWhat happens next will depend on what type of sentence the judge offers the brothers. There is a chance they could be given a new, lesser sentence that would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nBut eligibility does not guarantee release; they would still need to convince a state parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nOr the judge could opt for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe Menendez brothers filed a motion in 2023 detailing new evidence alleging childhood sexual abuse by their father, and requesting their convictions be vacated.\nThe evidence included an allegation of rape from a former member of boy band Menudo, Roy Rossell\u00f3, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse.\nThe top LA prosecutor at the time, George Gasc\u00f3n, announced that he was supporting the resentencing bid, days before an election in November 2024. He denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long time coming.\nGasc\u00f3n's announcement came shortly after a popular Netflix documentary and TV drama welcomed a new generation to the case. Many of the brothers' supporters suggest that if they were put on trial today, their allegations of abuse would be taken more seriously \u2013 potentially leading to a very different outcome.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n lost his re-election bid, Nathan Hochman took over the his office and the Menendez case. Hochman came out forcefully against their resentencing request, and said the brothers continued to stick by a litany of \"lies\". \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" he said. But Hochman was rebuked by a judge who allowed the resentencing request to move forward. \nThe brothers have been following three paths in an effort to win their freedom. The other two are: ",

And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,\" he said, adding that he expects to cut deals with every country \"over the next three to four weeks\".\nTrump also suggested thathe was reluctant to further raise tariffs on China - which currently stand at 145%. \n\"I may not want to go higher. I may want to go to less because you know, you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nAt a press conference on Thursday following Trump's and Meloni's conversation, the leaders said they had discussed defence spending, immigration and tariffs.\nThe atmosphere in the Oval Office appeared relaxed and good-natured - similar to the reception UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received during his visit to the White House in February.\nHowever Meloni's aides had described the visit as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's decision to impose a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US. \nHe has strongly criticised the European Union on trade, claiming it was \"formed to screw the United States\". A 20% \"retaliatory\" tariff on the EU has been temporarily suspended until July.\nMeloni previously called the tariffs \"absolutely wrong\" and said they would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\nWhile she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.\nGiven the fraught relations between the EU and the US, Meloni will likely chalk that up as a significant win, particularly if Trump agrees to meet the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, during the visit.\nMeloni will return to Europe with stronger credentials as the so-called \"Trump whisperer\", something that will be reinforced when she meets US Vice President JD Vance in Rome tomorrow.\nThe Italian leader was careful to praise Trump and align herself with the US president's viewpoints.\nIn her statement following the meeting, she criticised \"woke ideology\" and championed the \"war against illegal migration\".\n\"The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,\" she added.\nShe also seized the opportunity to tout the work of her own government. \"I'm proud of sitting here as prime minister of an Italy that today has a very good situation - a stable country, a reliable country,\" Meloni said. \nShe noted that her government had brought inflation down and improved employment, before gesturing towards Trump and adding with a broad smile: \"Forgive me if I promote my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me\". Trump grinned back.\nMeloni basked in the praise lavished on her by Trump - from compliments about her work as prime minister to gushing about her Italian sounding \"beautiful\".\nThe US president praised Meloni for taking a tough stance on immigration and said he wished more people were like her. Meloni said that change was happening, thanks to the example set by Italy, referring to yesterday's EU announcement on safe countries.\nIt was only occasionally that she showed a tinge of irritation when asked about Italy's low defence spending.\nMeloni said that she expects Italy to announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to meet the alliance's requirement that each member nation spends 2% of GDP on defence.\nDefence spending has been a key sticking point for Trump, with the US leader repeatedly demanding that Nato allies increase spending. \nItaly is one of eight countries that currently does not meet the 2% threshold, spending 1.49% on defence.\nItalian opposition leader Carlo Calenda said there had been \"two very positive outcomes\" from the visit: that Meloni \"stayed on track on Ukraine and managed to convince Trump to meet EU figures in Italy\".\nCalenda said Meloni had \"gained credibility as a bridge between the US and the EU\" but criticised her praise of \"Trump's fight on woke culture\".",

We are happy with that and take it in our stride,\" Ward told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"England will always have pressure. It is not going anywhere.\n\"Success is not about results or points difference, it is about the performance.\n\"It is also about team cohesion. We've had some good results but also some sticky performances.\n\"We want to keep growing that team cohesion and the ability to grow our game plan.\"\nDespite three bonus-point wins to sit top of the Six Nations table, Mitchell's side suffered a below-par first half in Cork last Saturday and led only 7-5 at half-time, but clicked into gear to score six unanswered second-half tries.\nIn England's opening two convincing wins over Italy and Wales, despite controlling large portions of both games, they still had areas to improve on to put together a dominant 80-minute performance.\nEngland were last defeated by New Zealand at the Rugby World Cup final in 2022, which ended their record 30-Test winning streak.\nWard, 32, was part of that loss and does not believe in the notion that the Red Roses are not tested enough before a home World Cup that starts in August.\n\"I heard something that England don't get put under pressure and I laughed as I thought you don't get to see us train,\" the lock added.\n\"We put ourselves under pressure week in and week out.

        "article_text": "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry! \nLady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.\nBetter yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).\nWith that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.\nLady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.\nHer second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.\nStaged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's  inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.\nDuring Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.\nIt was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off. \nIf you only watch one performance, make it this one.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).\nDespite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year. \nLuckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.\nShe arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.\nThe only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time).\n\n\"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".\nThe British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.\nWith her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.\nWatch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).\nAlthough Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.\nThey plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".\nThat aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"\nIt might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.\nHe rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.\nIt all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).\nSurprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two. \nAs someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).\nIn 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.\nLisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.\nAfter her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Ros\u00e9 (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).\nJennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.\nHighlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break -  and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.\nThe 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers. \nWatch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).\nCharli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.\nPerforming entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.\nCompared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.\nAt several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".\nWhether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen. But Charli is worth your time either way.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 7:15pm on Saturday (local time), or 3:15am on Sunday (UK time).\nAnyone who's had the pleasure of watching Benson Boone over the last year will know he's fond of performing a front flip off his piano, the big show off.\nHe didn't let us down at Coachella - bouncing around the stage like a Duracell Bunny attached to a car battery. To cap it all off, he brought out Brian May for a surprisingly successful version of Bohemian Rhapsody.\nLess fortunate, however, was Texan singer d4vd, whose attempt at a backflip went disastrously wrong.\nThankfully, he recovered in time to pull off an energetic set that highlighted the life-affirming vibes of his bedroom pop hits Feel It and What Are You Waiting For.\nAfter the set, he swore to practice harder for this weekend's performance. \"Imagine if I fall again,\" he cringed.\nWatch Benson Boone on the Coachella Stage at 7:05pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45 am on Saturday (UK Time). D4vd plays the Gobi Stage at 5:55pm on Friday (local time), or 1:55am on Saturday (UK time).\nLast Saturday, the entire LA Philharmonic Orchestra boarded a bus and set off for the desert to make their Coachella debut.\nUnder the baton of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, they performed what was billed as \"Gustavo's mixtape\" - moving seamlessly between classical standards like Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and modern pop hits.\nFor the latter, they were joined on stage by a host of A-list stars, including indie titan Beck, Icelandic songstress Laufey, country singer Maren Morris and rap icon LL Cool J.\n\"I told to the orchestra, 'I'm so happy conducting, but I wish I could be in the middle of the crowd and enjoy the moment,'\" Dudamel told Variety magazine ahead of the show.\nWeekend two will feature an all-new array of guest stars, he promised, but details are being kept under wraps for now. \nThe LA Philharmonic plays the Outdoor Theatre at 6:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 2:25am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"It took me 20 years to get on this stage,\" said T-Pain towards the end of his set on Saturday, and he certainly made the most of his hour-long set.\nHe covered Journey's Don't Stop Believin' and Chris Stapleton's country hit Tennessee Whiskey, while racing through early 2000s hits like Buy U A Drank and I'm In Luv, and revisiting his verses on Flo Rida's Low, and Kanye West's Good Life.\nFor that, he received a hero's welcome, with the crowd treating his set as an excuse for some turn of the millennium escapism. \nBy the time it ended, a campaign had started for T-Pain to play next year's Super Bowl half-time show.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 5:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 1:25am on Sunday (UK time).\nLuckily, you're not forced to stay up all night to watch the stars strut their stuff in California.\nCoachella's generous livestreams repeat throughout the day, and you can rewind several hours to find the performances you want.\nOther highlights from the first weekend included Megan Thee Stallion, whose star-studded set included appearances from Queen Latifah, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, and Ciara; and Kraftwerk, reminding everyone that they essentially invented electronic music.\nBelinda Carlisle reunited with her old band The Go-Gos for a dose of sun-kissed 1980s nostalgia, and the UK's Sam Fender tore through a blistering set that showcased the songwriting chops of his new album, People Watching.\nAmong the newcomers with main stage aspirations were South Africa's hip-swivelling R&B star Tyla, and New York dance act Fcukers, whose breakout hit Bon Bon was one of the weekend's most inescapable tracks.\nYou can see the full line-up for Coachella's second weekend on the festival's website.",

It's also the nation's sole producer of artichokes, figs, olives, walnuts and raisins.\nNewsom argued California has been \"disproportionately affected\" by the tariffs and that's why the state, which has already filed 15 lawsuits against Trump since January, would lead the charge against the levies - which currently are 10% on most countries and 145% on China. \n\"That's our state of mind,\" the governor said. \"That's why we're asserting ourselves on behalf of 40 million Americans.\"\nThe lawsuit challenges Trump evoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact the tariffs, arguing the act had never been used for such levies and such powers rest with the US Congress. \nThe lawsuit cites multiple times from rulings by the US Supreme Court against the Biden administration in its quest to forgive student debt, noting the high court called Biden's manoeuvres a \"transformative expansion\" of presidential authority. \nNewsom said if the Supreme Court is \"consistent, then this lawsuit is a lock\" for the state. \nThe act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president, congressional research shows. \nWhile California is the first state to file legal action against the Trump administration over the levies, several other lawsuits filed by small businesses and a civil rights group have similarly challenged Trump's authority on the matter. \nSince Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs.\nThe US president says the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.\nCritics argue that bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime.\nTrump has also backtracked on many of his announcements.\nJust hours after steep levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries except China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets.",

However, only a small number were ever actually held at the base.\nThe Pentagon spent around $38m (\u00a328.7m) on deportation and detention operations at Guantanamo Bay in the first month of operations this year alone, a Department of Defense official said.\nBut new images now show that around two-thirds of the roughly 260 tents installed as part of the operation had been removed as of 16 April.\nWhen asked about the removal of the tents, a US defence official said: \"This force adjustment represents a deliberate and efficient use of resources - not a reduction in readiness.\"\nThe camp began construction just a day after President Trump announced the plan, with tents going up between 30 January and 12 February. Visible construction continued until 8 March, with scattered temporary structures appearing on satellite imagery.\nThe construction marked a significant expansion to the Guantanamo Migrant Operations Center - a facility long used to hold some migrants and distinct from the high-security military prison used to house detainees suspected by the US of terrorism offences.\nThe photos below show a mix of around 260 green and white military tents in an area to the south-west of the overall Guantanamo Bay base on 1 April. But by 10 April many had been removed.\nSubsequent lower resolution images show that as of 16 April a total of around 175 tents appeared to have been taken down.\nIt's unclear how many migrants remain at the facility. Stephen Miller - the White House deputy chief of staff - insisted in an interview with Fox News last week that the base remained open and that \"a large number of foreign terrorist aliens\" were still there.\nThe White House failed to reply to a request for comment on whether removal of the tents represented a reversal of Trump's plans to expand the detention facility.\nDespite Trump's pledge to send 30,000 migrants to the base, a US defence official indicated that the deployment to the island was to support a population of 2,500 detainees.\nBBC Verify's analysis of likely tent capacity estimated it at less than 3,000 people, based on US military sleeping guidelines.\nTrump said in January that the expansion would largely be used to hold undocumented migrants deemed to be dangerous criminals or national security risks.\n\"Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them, because we don't want them coming back,\" he said of migrants. \"So we're going to send them to Guantanamo... it's a tough place to get out.\"\nBut since its inception two and a half months ago, around 400 migrants have reportedly been sent there, with more than half since returned to facilities in the US. Others have been deported, such as 177 people who were sent to Venezuela via Honduras on 20 February.\nOn 28 March, a group of five Democrat senators visited the base. In a statement, they said they were \"outraged by the scale and wastefulness of the Trump Administration's misuse of our military\", and described the camp as \"seemingly designed to undermine due process and evade legal scrutiny\".\nThe delegation of senators said the cost to fly immigrants out of the US and detain them at Guantanamo Bay came to \"tens of millions of dollars a month\" and called it \"an insult to American taxpayers\".\nAdditional reporting by Joshua Cheetham. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "A suspect accused of killing two people and injuring six others during a shooting spree at Florida State University did not know his victims, police said Friday. \nThe alleged gunman, 20-year-old FSU student Phoenix Ikner, began shooting around lunchtime on Thursday near the student union building in Tallahassee. The motive remains unclear.\nPolice said the gun was owned by his stepmother, Jessica Ikner, a veteran police officer. \nIn a video statement, Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell said: \"At this point, there does not appear to be any connection at all between the shooter and any of the victims.\"\nDetails about the victims began to emerge Friday. One of two people killed was an employee of food service provider Aramark, the company said on Friday. \nTiru Chabba, 45, of Greenville, South Carolina, was a married father of two, according to a statement from a law firm hired by his family. He was on the Florida campus working Thursday when the shooting began.\n\"We are heartbroken to confirm that an Aramark employee was among those killed at FSU yesterday in that senseless act of violence,\" the company, which manages Florida State University's on-campus dining programmes, said in a statement. \"We are absolutely shaken by the news and our deepest sympathies are with the family and our entire Aramark community.\"\nThe other dead victim, university dining worker Robert Morales, was identified by his sister, who posted a tribute online. His LinkedIn profile said he had been working at FSU as a university dining co-ordinator since 2015.\nAt a news conference on Friday, doctors at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare hospital said six people injured by gunshots were in stable condition, with one seriously injured. \nDoctors said two of the victims would be released from hospital on Friday, and all were expected to make full recoveries. \nAccording to a police timeline, officers responded to an active shooter call shortly before midday local time on Thursday. An alert was issued warning students and those on campus to \"seek shelter and await further instructions\".\n\"One of my classmates got an alert on her phone and announced it to the rest of the class,\" student Ava Arenado told CBS News Miami.\nAnother student, Blake Leonard, told CBS he initially heard roughly 12 shots fired.\n\"In my head, I thought it was construction at first, until I looked behind me and saw people running from the union towards my direction, and then I heard another 12 or 15 shots go off, so I started running away from there too,\" he said.\nThe incident ended less than five minutes later when police shot Mr Ikner after he did not comply with their commands, authorities said. He was undergoing treatment at a local hospital, police said.\nChief Revell said Mr Ikner had serious injuries and would be in hospital for a \"significant time\", after which he will face charges \"up to and including first-degree murder\". \nLeon County Sheriff Walt McNeil described the suspect's stepmother Mrs Ikner, who worked as a school resource officer, as a \"model employee\".\nHe said the gun used in the shooting was a police-issued firearm that Mrs Ikner kept for personal use after the force upgraded its weapons. A shotgun also was found at the scene, police said.\nThe suspect was a \"longstanding member\" of the sheriff office's youth advisory council and was engaged in a number of training programmes, Sheriff McNeil said.\n\"So it is not a surprise that he had access to weapons,\" he said.\nCourt documents indicate that the alleged gunman was largely raised by his father and stepmother.\nHe was previously known as Christian Eriksen and was the subject of a long-running custody dispute between his biological mother and father. He had health issues including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a growth disorder, according to court documents.\nThe FSU student newspaper quoted the suspect commenting on an anti-Trump rally on campus in January.\nFSUNews.com said Mr Ikner, who was registered to vote as a Republican, commented about anti-Trump protesters: \"These people are usually pretty entertaining, usually not for good reasons.\"\nPresident Donald Trump, who said he was briefed on the incident, called the shooting \"a shame, a horrible thing\".\nWhen asked by reporters whether he wanted to change gun regulations in light of the shooting, he said he was a \"big advocate\" of the Second Amendment in the US Constitution, which protects gun rights.\n\"I have been since the beginning,\" he said. \"I have protected it. These things are terrible. We will have more to say about it later.\"",

        "article_text": "Harry Maguire joined Manchester United from Leicester City in 2019\nManchester United defender Harry Maguire says their 5-4 win against Lyon was the \"strangest game\" he has ever played in. \nThe England centre-back scored the second of two goals in the 120th minute of extra time to send United through to the semi-finals of the Europa League with a 7-6 aggregate victory.\nLyon, who had been 2-0 down on the night, scored four times without reply and had Corentin Tolisso sent off, before conceding three times in seven extra-time minutes. \nThe fixture was the first in European history in which five goals were scored in extra time, while United became the first club to score twice in the 120th minute of a European tie. \nMaguire, who was named United captain in 2020 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but was stripped of the armband under Erik ten Hag in 2023, said the victory was one of his career highlights. \n\"It was an incredible feeling to score that winner in such an important game, in a game that was full of emotion and the strangest, maddest game I've ever played in or witnessed,\" said Maguire. \n\"I've been here six years now and I've had some great times and some bad times as well.\n\"I think that game pretty much summed up my time at this club, to be honest.\n\"I don't know how I would have felt if I had come here and been speaking to you after a 4-2 defeat - it's not even worth trying to think about that.\"\nGreatest European comebacks as Man Utd beat Lyon\n'Three games from glory, Man Utd begin to show never-say-die DNA'\nMaguire scores last-minute winner as Man Utd beat Lyon in nine-goal classic\nUnited had been cruising in the first half, taking a 2-0 lead into half-time after goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot.\nBut Tolisso's header halved the deficit 19 minutes from time, before Nicolas Tagliafico equalised six minutes later. \nDespite being reduced to 10 men, Lyon took the lead on aggregate through Rayan Cherki in extra time before former Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette scored a fourth from the penalty spot.\nLyon's players celebrated Lacazette's effort 11 minutes from time by running towards the away end, at the other end of the pitch to where the penalty was taken. \n\"I think they [Lyon] thought they'd won it, the way they were celebrating,\" said Maguire.\n\"That gave us more of an incentive to turn the game around. \n\"I think the worst feeling was that we felt we'd thrown it away, rather than lost the game at that moment, and how we managed to get ourselves into that situation, because even going into extra time at 2-2, the momentum was back with us with the sending off, we shouldn't end up in that situation.\n\"We've got to do far better than that if we want to win this competition - we can't be doing that and be leaving it to turn it around in that situation.\"\nUnited boss Ruben Amorim says he will trust the \"kids\" to guide the club through the remainder of the Premier League season in order to rest some of his senior players for Europe. \nUnited will face Spanish side Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals, after their 2-0 aggregate win against Rangers. \nThe competition is now United's main focus, despite having six matches to play in the remainder of a Premier League campaign which sees the 20-time champions of England floundering in 14th.\nThe United boss noted Portuguese duo Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot were both suffering from fatigue as Thursday's epic encounter drew to a close.\nIt means 17-year-old striker Chido Obi, who is not registered to play in Europe, is likely to play some part against Wolves at Old Trafford on Sunday.\nThe same is also true of full-back Harry Amass, who came on for Patrick Dorgu for the final 20 minutes against Lyon, defenders Jaydan Kamason and Godwill Kukonki and midfielder Jack Moorhouse, who were all on the bench.\nStriker Gabriel Biancheri has been on the fringes of the first team, as have Darren Fletcher's twin sons Jack and Tyler Fletcher.\nIf former Arsenal defender Ayden Heaven has recovered from the setback he suffered as he closed on full fitness after a recent ankle injury, he will be involved too given how much the 18-year-old impressed in his four first-team outings before last month's international break.\n\"It is not the best moment or the best season to put kids in because they need a strong base to really show what they can do,\" said Amorim.\n\"But in this moment you need to do it and sometimes you have some surprises.\n\"I can be honest, Ayden [Heaven] just played because we had a lot of injuries in that moment. But today I think of him as my player. When he is ready he is facing the competition in the team because he is ready to play.\n\"You don't know. Amass did really well today. Chido when he played, did quite well. It is a difficult moment and not the right moment for the kids to play. But if we have to do it, we will.\"\nIt is not known yet whether senior defenders Noussair Mazraoui or Victor Lindelof will be involved against Wolves.\nMazraoui was taken off at half-time and Lindelof had a planned substitute appearance scrapped after they were alerted independently to medical issues at home.\n\"It was the same for both,\" he said. \n\"Sometimes you don't control these things but everything is OK now. I know football is really important but there are things that are more important. They will be ready to play the next game.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "It was once the Indian start-up world's shining star, but Ola is now battling a multitude of crises.\nFounded in 2010, it quickly became a household name, expanding from ride-hailing to electric vehicles and battery cells, challenging Uber along the way.\nThe company jumped on the AI bandwagon in 2023 with Krutrim, India's first AI company valued at over $1bn.\nMarquee global investors such as Japan's SoftBank, US-based Tiger Global and Singapore's Temasek bankrolled this expansion. Last year, Ola's electric vehicles (EV) arm raised close to $734m (\u00a3567m) in a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), India's biggest in 2024. \nBut this ambitious rise has been accompanied by a series of controversies lately, particularly at its EV arm.\nOla Electric has lost close to 70% of its value in the seven months since the IPO was launched. It is facing competition from more established two-wheeler giants, along with mounting regulatory scrutiny.\nSales of Ola's scooters are down to less than half from April last year and the company's losses have widened. Customers have posted videos on social media of Ola scooters going up in flames or breaking down mid-ride.\nThere's a government inquiry under way at hundreds of newly-opened Ola showrooms regarding licences and registrations. One of its vendors also filed an insolvency plea against the company, which Ola said in a statement to stock exchanges that it had settled.\nThe BBC has learnt from former employees and industry sources that delayed payments have led to many major suppliers and logistics partners ending ties with them.\nOla has been cutting jobs, restructuring operations and automating functions in a bid to reduce costs and trim losses. Media reports say it has undertaken a second round of layoffs since November, with over 1,000 roles axed.\nThe BBC sent detailed questions to Ola about these issues. The company shared links to some of its earlier press statements, not responding specifically to all the queries.\nSo, what's gone wrong?\nOla CEO Bhavish Aggarwal positioned the company as Tesla's two-wheeler equivalent, solving the emissions problem for the price-sensitive Indian market.\nHe poured in millions of marketing dollars, opening Ola showrooms across India, even delivering scooters at the doorstep of people who'd made online bookings.\nBut Ola has struggled to read the market well, says Rohit Paradkar, an analyst with the auto magazine Overdrive. \nIts scooter is modelled on the AppScooter from Etergo, a Dutch start-up that Ola Electric acquired in 2020. \nSeveral former employees told the BBC that Ola's first EV scooter was launched without many changes to Etergo's version. A former employee who worked in the compliance department told the BBC that clearances were rushed through to meet unrealistic launch deadlines. \nIn response to queries, Ola referred to an October 2023 blog post where it addressed the \"myth\" that the vehicle had \"not been engineered and tested for India\". It said it had \"fully re-engineered\" Etergo's scooter and tested it for \"Indian conditions\". \n\"The whole vehicle has been tested at three levels [for India] - digital simulations, component tests and vehicular lab tests, and vehicular field tests,\" it said in the post.\nBut several safety-related incidents reported by customers have raised questions.\nSome scooters began catching fire which, auto experts say, was likely due to short-circuits or faulty battery management system. \nOla recalled more than 1,400 first-generation scooters in 2022 to investigate the fires, but the report was not publicly released. It had then said the battery systems were compliant for Indian and European standards but didn't explain what caused the fires.\nSome riders also reported the front suspension - which holds the wheel in place - breaking mid-ride, causing injuries. \nIn early 2023, after such an accident, Ola called it a rare case, noting there were only a few such issues among 150,000 scooters. \nThe front fork arm, they said, had a significant safety margin for accidents and was designed to handle 80% more load than what it would typically experience during daily use.\nMeanwhile, Ola's rivals - mostly established automakers - have rolled out electric scooters smoothly, adding to the pressure on the company.\nTheir entry shook the market. Ola's share had plunged from 52% to 19% by December, then recovered to 25% in January. \nOla aims to sell 50,000 units monthly to turn profitable, but analysts doubt the target, despite the company saying recent restructuring has helped it achieve $10m monthly savings and faster deliveries.\nGovernment data shows that less than 10,000 scooters were sold in February, but Ola claims 25,000, blaming registration delays due to vendor contract changes. The federal transport ministry has issued notices over the discrepancy. Ola said it had registered over 23,000 scooters sold in March and held a 30% market share for the fiscal year.\nBut competing scooters with fewer features are now outselling Ola simply because they come from trusted, well-established brands, said Jay Kale, executive vice-president and auto analyst at Elara Capital.\nTo push sales, Ola has offered deep discounts, launching newer models at cheaper price points. But losses have widened to $65m in the October-December quarter from $43.6m a year ago.\nBesides product issues, the reliability of its customer service has been another major issue, says Kale.\nWhen angry customers flooded social media and consumer helplines with complaints about the fires and front suspension, their service requests were reportedly unanswered for days.\nAt one point, thousands of complaints were piling up monthly, a former employee at Ola told the BBC. India's consumer rights agency, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), also sent a notice to Ola after it got 10,000 complaints over the period of a year.\nBut since Ola had eschewed the established dealer route in a bid to sell directly to buyers and had just a few service centres, aggrieved consumers had few places to turn to.\nLate last year, Ola wrote to the CCPA that it had a \"robust mechanism to address complaints\", and that most raised with the regulator had been satisfactorily resolved.\nAggarwal was initially dismissive of the problems on social media but later announced that Ola would be opening nearly 4,000 stores with service facilities, following a heated public exchange on X with a stand-up comedian who took up the customers' cause.\nA majority of these new centres, however, came under the government's scanner for lacking relevant licences to store and sell vehicles.\nOn 21 March, Ola confirmed investigations in four states and said it was responding to authorities.\nThe sharp turn in Ola's fortunes is making investors - especially those who bought in at high IPO valuations - nervous.\nOla has been a key player in India's push to cut carbon emissions and expand manufacturing.\nIt benefits from two separate state subsidies, one to make scooters and the second to set up its own 20 gigawatt EV battery plant. But Reuters has reported that the costly gigafactory project is delayed and has missed a key milestone, potentially leading to penalties.\nCritics say Ola's troubles emanate from typical culture issues that plague many start-ups - including CEO-driven decision-making, constant pivots and unrealistic, high-pressure deadlines.\n\"Software mindsets don't work with hardware products, which need time to build,\" said Deepesh Rathore, who used to head product strategy at Ola Electric and now runs consultancy firm Insight EV.\nSome top executives across the wider company have quit recently, including a former Ola Cab CEO who quit within months. Key leaders in tech, marketing, sales and business also left last year. \nExperts say the exits have also affected Ola's efforts to fix product and service issues.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds\nThere are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. \nOne such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.\nNow, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.\n\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\nBut all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?\nOur ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.\nIt was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.\nBut decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.\nPart of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look. \nUntil relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. \nAlthough astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.\nMany are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. \nBut many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.\nAs these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. \nThe idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.\nAnd they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.\nNasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.\nBut JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)\nAlso coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. \nIt has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.\nProf Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. \nInstead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.\nEventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.\n\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".\nThe world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. \nIn similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.\nA much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.\nThe scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.\nChina's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.\nBut the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.\n\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. \n\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".\nNasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\". \nAlong with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.\nProf Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?\n\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.\n\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.\nIf simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.\nProf Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"\nDr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.\n\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.\n\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"\nHe believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.\nAs he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.\nProf Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.\n\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.\n\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".\nNever before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.\n\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.\n\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.\n\"It will be another step in our evolution\".\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "When US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in his first term, Vietnamese entrepreneur Hao Le saw an opportunity.\nHis company is one of hundreds of businesses that have emerged to compete with Chinese exports that have increasingly been facing restrictions from the West.\nLe's SHDC Electronics, which sits in the budding industrial hub of Hai Duong, sells $2m (\u00a31.5m) worth of phone and computer accessories every month to the United States.\nBut that revenue could dry up if Trump imposes 46% tariffs on Vietnamese goods, a plan that is currently on hold until early July.  That would be \"catastrophic for our business,\" Le says. \nAnd selling to Vietnamese consumers is not an option, he adds: \"We cannot compete with Chinese products. This is not just our challenge. Many Vietnamese companies are struggling in their own home market.\"\nTrump tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers. But they also opened new doors for other businesses, often into global supply chains that wanted to cut their dependence on China.   \nBut Trump 2.0 threaten to shut those doors, which it sees as an unacceptable loophole. And that's a blow for fast-growing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia that are gunning to be key players in industries from chips to electric vehicles.\nThey also find themselves stuck between the world's two biggest economies - China, a powerful neighbour and their biggest trading partner, and the US, a key export market, which could be looking to strike a deal at Beijing's expense.\nAnd so Xi Jinping's long-planned trip to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week took on fresh urgency.\nAll three countries rolled out the the red carpet for him, but Trump saw it as more evidence of them conspiring to \"screw\" the US.\nThe White House will use its upcoming negotiations with smaller nations to pressure them into limiting their dealings with Beijing, according to reports. \nBut that could be a fanciful ambition given the amount of money flowing between   China and South East Asia.   \nIn 2024, China earned a record $3.5tn from exports - 16% of those went to South East Asia, its biggest market. Beijing, in turn, has paid for railways in Vietnam, dams in Cambodia and ports in Malaysia as part of its \"Belt and Road\" infratructure programme that seeks to boost ties abroad. \n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC on Tuesday, ahead of Xi's visit.\n\"If the issue is about something that we feel is against our interest, then we will protect [ourselves].\"\nIn the days after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs, South East Asian governments scrambled into deal-making mode.\nIn what Trump described as a \"very productive call\" with Vietnamese leader To Lam, the latter offered to completely scrap tariffs on US goods. \nThe US market is crucial to Vietnam, an emerging electronics powerhouse where manufacturing giants like Samsung, Intel and Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm contracted to make iPhones, have set up shop.\nMeanwhile, Thai officials are headed to Washington with a plan that includes higher US imports and investments. The US is their largest export market, so they are hoping to avoid the 36% levy on Thailand that Trump may reinstate.\n\"We will tell the US government that Thailand is not only an exporter but also an ally and economic partner that the US can rely on in the long term,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has ruled out retaliation against Trump's tariffs, instead choosing to emphasise their economic and political importance to the US.\n\"We understand the concerns of the US,\" Mr Zafrul told the BBC. \"That's why we need to show that actually we, Asean, especially Malaysia, can be that bridge.\"\nIt's a role that South East Asia's export-driven economies have played well - they have benefitted from both Chinese and US trade and investment. But Trump's paused levies could derail that.\nTake Malaysia, for instance. In recent years, chip manufacturers from the US and elsewhere have invested there, as Washington blocks the sale of advanced tech to China. Last year China imported $18bn worth of chips from Malaysia. These chips are used in Chinese-made electronics, such as iPhones, typically bound for the US. \nTrump's proposed tariffs on Malaysia - 24% - could cut off the multi-billion dollar US market. But that's not all. \n\"If this continues, then companies will have to rethink their investment commitments,\" Mr Zafrul says. \"This will have an impact not just on Malaysia's economy, but on the global economy.\"\nThen there is Indonesia, which could face 32% tariffs, and is home to vast nickel reserves and has its sights set on the global electric vehicle supply chain.\nCambodia, a Chinese ally, faces the steepest levies: 49%. One of the poorest countries in the region, it has thrived as a trans-shipment hub for Chinese businesses seeking to skirt US tariffs. Chinese businesses currently own or operate 90% of the clothes factories, which mainly export to the US.\nTrump may have hit pause on these tariffs but \"the damage is done,\" says Doris Liew, an economist at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.\n\"This serves as a wake-up call for the region, not only to reduce reliance on the US, but also to re-balance overdependence on any single trade and export partner.\"\nIn these uncertain times , Xi Jinping is trying to send a steadfast message: Let's join hands and resist \"bullying\" from the US.\nThat is no easy task because South East Asia also has trade tensions with Beijing. \nIn Indonesia, business owner Isma Savitri is worried that Trump's 145% tariffs on China means more competition from Chinese rivals who can no longer export to the US. \n\"Small businesses like us feel squeezed,\" says the owner of sleepwear brand Helopopy. \"We are struggling to survive against an onslaught of ultra-cheap Chinese products.\"\nOne of Helopopy's popular pyjamas sells for $7.10 (119,000 Indonesian rupiah). Isma says she has seen similar designs from China going for around half that price.\n\"South East Asia, being close by, with open trade regimes and fast-growing markets, naturally became the dumping ground,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"Politically, many countries are reluctant to confront Beijing, which adds another layer of vulnerability.\"\nWhile consumers have welcomed competitively-priced Chinese products - from clothes to shoes to phones - thousands of local businesses have not been able to match such low prices.\nMore than 100 factories in Thailand have closed every month for the last two years, according to an estimate from a Thai think tank. During the same period in Indonesia, around 250,000 textile workers were laid off after some 60 garment manufacturers shut, local trade associations say  - including Sritex, once the region's largest textile maker.\n\"When we see the news, there are lots of imported products flooding the domestic market, which messes up our own market,\" Mujiati, a worker who was laid off from Sritex in February after 30 years, tells the BBC.\n\"Maybe it just wasn't our luck,\" says the 50-year-old, who is still hunting for work. \"Who can we complain to? There's no-one.\"\nSouth East Asian governments responded with a wave of protectionism, as local businesses demanded to be shielded from the impact of Chinese imports.\nLast year Indonesia considered 200% tariffs on a range of Chinese goods and blocked e-commerce site Temu, popular among Chinese merchants. Thailand tightened inspections of imports and imposed additional tax on goods worth less than 1,500 Thai baht ($45; \u00a334).\nThis year Vietnam has twice imposed temporary anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel products. And after Trump's latest tariffs announcement, Vietnam is reportedly set to crack down on Chinese goods being trans-shipped via its territory to the US.\nAllaying these fears would have been on Xi's agenda this week. \nChina is concerned that channelling its US-bound exports to the rest of the world would \"end up really alienating and aggravating\" its trading partners, David Rennie, the former Beijing bureau chief for the Economist newspaper, told BBC's Newshour.\n\"If a tidal wave of Chinese exports ends up swamping those markets and damaging employment and jobs \u2026 that's a massive diplomatic and geopolitical headache for the Chinese leadership.\"\nChina has not always had an easy relationship with this region. Barring Laos, Cambodia and a war-torn Myanmar, the others are wary of Beijing's ambitions. Territorial disputes in the South China have soured ties with the Philippines. This is also an issue with others such as Vietnam and Malaysia, but trade has been a balancing factor. \nBut that might change now, experts say. \n\"South East Asia had to think about whether they really wanted to offend China. Now this complicates things,\" says Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore. \nChina's loss could be South East Asia's gain. \nHao Le, in Vietnam, says he has seen a surge in enquiries from American customers scouting for new electronics suppliers, outside of China: \"In the past, US buyers would take months to switch suppliers. Today, such decisions are made within days.\"\nMalaysia, with sprawling rubber plantations and the world's largest medical rubber glove maker, has nearly half the world's market for rubber gloves. But it is poised to grab a bigger share from its main competitor, China.   \nThe region still faces a 10% baseline tariff, like most of the world. And that is bad news, says Oon Kim Hung, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association. \nBut even if the paused tariffs kick in, he says, customers will find paying an additional 24% on Malaysian gloves vastly preferable to the 145% levy they will have to cough up for Chinese-made gloves.\n\"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit our manufacturers, as well as those in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\"\nAdditional reporting by Abhiram V Subramaniam",

Even before Noem's statement, billions of dollars hung in the balance for the university, after the freeze of some $2.2 bn (\u00a31.7bn) in federal funding.\nTrump has also threatened to also remove Harvard's valuable tax exemption, the loss of which could cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. US media reports suggest the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has started drawing up plans to enact this.\nHarvard has said there is \"no legal basis\" to remove its tax exemption, and that \"such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission\".\nTrump launched a renewed attack on the university on Wednesday, saying it could \"no longer be considered even a decent place of learning\".\nThe administration's attacks on Harvard are not isolated. The government's antisemitism task force has identified at least 60 universities for review.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump pitched a funding crackdown on universities, painting them as hostile to conservatives. He and Vice-President JD Vance have long railed against higher education institutions.\nPolling by Gallup last year suggested that confidence in higher education had been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, particularly Republicans - in part due to a belief that universities push a political agenda. \nSince taking office, Trump has focused particularly on universities where pro-Palestinian protests have taken place. Some Jewish students have said they felt unsafe and faced harassment on campus. \nIn March, Columbia University agreed to several of the administration's demands, after $400m in federal funding was pulled over accusations the university failed to fight antisemitism.\nThese included replacing the official leading its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department and pledging to take on a review to \"ensure unbiased admission processes\". \nHarvard too has made concessions - including by dismissing the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, who had come under fire for failing to represent Israeli perspectives.\nBut it has drawn the line at the White House's recent list of demands.",

How long can it last?Trump threatens Harvard's tax-exempt status Obama calls Trump's freeze of funding unlawfulTrump launched a renewed attack on the university on Wednesday, saying it could \"no longer be considered even a decent place of learning\".The administration's attacks on Harvard are not isolated. \"The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\" Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a message on Monday to the Harvard community.The new request from Noem said the institution would lose the \"privilege of enrolling foreign students\" if it did not comply with the demand for records.Harvard said it was aware of the new request from Noem, which was made in a letter, the Reuters news agency reported.International students make up more than 27% of Harvard's enrolment this year. Harvard earlier said it had taken many steps to address antisemitism, and that demands were an effort to regulate the university's \"intellectual conditions\". Even before Noem's statement, billions of dollars hung in the balance for the university, after the freeze of some $2.2 bn (\u00a31.7bn) in federal funding.Trump has also threatened to also remove Harvard's valuable tax exemption, the loss of which could cost Harvard millions of dollars each year.",

        "article_text": "Matt Beard won back-to-back WSL titles with Liverpool in 2013 and 2014\nWhen Women's Super League managers are sacked, the clock is ticking to find another job as soon as possible. \nWith families to look after and few opportunities for full-time jobs in the game, it's not the easiest thing to do. \n\"If a Premier League manager loses their job, they are comfortable financially - but we are not,\" former Liverpool boss Matt Beard told BBC Sport.\nBeard, 47, was sacked at the end of February after four years in his second spell with the club.\nHe says he needs to get something lined up \"by the summer at the latest\" in order to provide for his wife and two children, aged 14 and 12. \n\"I need a plan A and a plan B. I want to stay in football but if I can't find anything - there are not that many professional teams in England in the women's game - then I need to look at maybe going back into estate agency work or something like that,\" added Beard.\n\"It would probably be a last resort for me. But at the end of the day I have a family I need to support. I need to look at all options.\"\nBeard believes losing his job is \"part and parcel\" of being a football manager and he was supported by the League Managers' Association (LMA) when he left Liverpool.\nBut his family moved up to north-west England from London, where the children started new schools, and he is conscious of disrupting things as he contemplates his next steps. \n\"I want to stay in the game and continue managing. I have my pro licence and degree in business management,\" said Beard. \n\"I think people see me as a fixer who can build something but I know I'm much more than that when I look back at my time as a football manager.\n\"Roles like a technical director or sporting director are something I would maybe consider. I might also look at high performance workshops or even podcasts.\"\nBeard left Liverpool on strong terms having guided the club to back-to-back WSL titles in 2013 and 2014 during his first spell, before winning the Women's Championship in 2022 on his return.\nHe says getting sacked with a year and a half left on his contract was \"difficult\" but he only has respect for the club and the support they gave him.\n\"It was going to happen at some point in my career,\" said Beard.\n\"You have to take emotions out of the conversation. I have no qualms with the decision but I still think we would have finished in the top five this season. \n\"It's frustrating losing your job. Was I owed time? I don't know. I have nothing but pride when I look at the journey. \n\"I have a great relationship with the club and the people. I respected the decision and it's just one of those things. I'm ready to go again now.\"\nTime away has allowed Beard to reflect on the state of the game and what it was like competing financially with WSL leaders Chelsea.\nHe says other clubs must find ways to invest and grow simultaneously - but not at the expense of losing their connection with the fanbase. \n\"I think you've seen the game grow so much in such a short space of time. I'm always concerned that we run before we walk,\" added Beard.\n\"I have always been an advocate for the bond we have with the fans. That's what makes our game unique and I don't want to see that go.\n\"I also look at Chelsea and the money they have spent\u2026 who can compete with that? They spent more on two players than we did on our entire squad. It's crazy.\n\"It's everyone else's problem. Arsenal have got it right, I think. They can compete financially, they have marketed their games well and get good crowds at the Emirates. I think that's probably the way forward.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.\nIn the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.\n- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you\u2019re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.\n- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.\nDees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

The baffling purple honey found only in North Carolina1 hour agoShareSaveIvy CarruthShareSaveAlamyIn a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.In the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.

I really wish they get back in touch with me.\"\nThe Welsh government said it \"continues to engage\" with the owner of the site.\n\"We recognise the significant value the former Oakwood site holds for locals and visitors, and are hopeful a buyer will come forward to ensure its continued contribution to the local economy and tourism industry,\" a spokesperson said. \nPembrokeshire council confirmed it had not held any discussions with Aspro Parks.\nAspro did not respond to enquiries from BBC Wales.",

It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"\nAs well as becoming far better travelled, the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways, acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK, a mental health charity for young people, and Winston's Wish, a children and young people's grief charity.\nOne of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.\nSpeaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].\n \"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"\nRace Across the World resumes on Wednesday, with a new raft of contestants heading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.\nThey include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.\nThe rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.\nWatts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and \"a topsy turvey\" series.\n\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"\nHis \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".\nHe'd also suggest taking \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.\n\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.\n\"And I think we're probably going to see that this series, that people have been a lot more streetwise with how they've prepared.\"\nIs he worried about losing his title as the show's youngest winner?\nHe replies, like a true international diplomat, that he just wants the pair who \"nicely interact\" with the others and \"who genuinely appreciate the opportunity to travel\" to win.\n\"I think those are always the people that you want to do best, and if that happens to be the two 18-year-olds this time, then I'll be happy to hand my crown over.\"\nSeries five of Race Across the World begins on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April.",

I'm very family orientated,\" she said, adding she was now \"less afraid of going totally blind than being a mother\".\nShe said she worried about coping as a mother, particularly as her partner, who was an engineer, often worked away.\n\"It's honestly terrifying,\" Ms Troth said. \n\"I've not got any peripheral vision - how am I going to see a child running around? How am I going to be allowed to look after a baby by myself? How do I access support?\n\"You're also constantly thinking 'if I don't have a child soon, will I ever get to see what my child would look like?'\"\nThere are about 2.2m people living with sight loss across the UK and 60% are women.\nUntil the 1960s, these women were were often considered unfit to parent and some went through sterilisation. \nBut the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said many disabled women continued to fight for respect and support today.\nAbout 41% of blind and partially-sighted women felt there were misconceptions about mothers with sight loss, and 26% believed these were held by health professionals, its research found.\nMs Troth uses social media to raise awareness, visiting hospitality venues and showing what they are like for someone with access needs.                                                                                                                                                        \nRhian Morris, from Bridgend, has nystagmus, myopia, and glaucoma and has lived with visual impairments since she was born. \nTwo of her sons, aged 13 and three, have sight loss, while her one-year-old has Down's Syndrome.\n\"Stuff like changing nappies, I probably take a bit longer with... buttons and poppers on baby grows, I've lost hope with - I buy ones with zippers now,\" Ms Morris said.\nShe said taking her son to school could be challenging \"because of people parking on pavements\", but she had a symbol on her pram telling people she had sight loss. \nThe 39-year-old said her phone was her \"lifeline\" as it allowed her to take photos of things and then zoom in, adding: \"I have taken the boys away on my own and done days out on my own because I want the boys to know they can do it. \n\"If you can't do something, you will find a way around it or you will ask for help.\"\nShe believed sometimes people, often well-intentioned, underestimate her abilities, but women with sight loss \"shouldn't be afraid\" to become mums.\n\"Anyone has to adapt to having children, it's no different,\" she added.\nTafsila Khan, a mum of three from Cardiff who also has retinitis pigmentosa, said her sight deterioration was gradual until her early 30s, after she had her children - none of whom inherited the condition.\nThe 41-year-old added that, from a young age, her children could look out for the correct bus, order at a cafe, or ask a retail worker for help.\nShe said: \"Taking them to the park and things, I thought would be a challenge, but they've grown up with a mum with sight loss so, for them, that's just the norm. \n\"It has made them so much more confident... they've had to do things other children didn't, but I feel it's had a positive effect.\"\nAnsley Workman, director of RNIB Cymru, said negative opinions towards people with sight loss and \"assumptions about their ability to parent\" could have a \"huge impact on their confidence and access to resources\".\n\"Becoming a parent can bring new and unexpected challenges, regardless of who you are. This doesn't stop parenting from being a hugely rewarding and exciting experience,\" she said.\n\"RNIB Cymru is calling for everyone to support mothers with sight loss by making information accessible and dispelling harmful myths.\"\nThe Welsh government said the Wales Low Vision Service, provided by optometry practices, was the only service of its kind in the UK and provided more than 8,000 appointments for people with sight loss, of which almost 5,500 were women, in 2023-24.\n\"We fund a number of organisations to help people with sight loss live confidently and safely, and work with the Wales Vision Forum to improve access to services,\" it added.",

Although the Australian was quicker in both the second and third sectors, the Dutchman had done enough to grab pole.\nVerstappen said: \"I definitely didn't expect to be on pole here but the car came alive in the night and it was a lot more enjoyable to drive. The grip was coming to me. Around here a qualifying lap is extremely difficult. It is really satisfying.\n\"Tomorrow in the race it will be tough to keep them behind but we are going to give it a good go.\"\nNorris did not want to speak about his crash in interviews after qualifying\nPiastri said: \"Max has done a good job, another high-speed circuit for them, where they seem to have a little more success. Our pace is good. It's going to be a tough race, the tyres are softer than last year and we'll see if that plays to our advantage.\"\nNorris will have to rely on the strong race pace of the McLaren to try to limit the damage to his championship position, as he starts the race three points clear of Piastri and eight in front of Verstappen.\nHis accident was caused by him misjudging the entry to the chicane at Turns Four and Five. The car oversteered on to the kerb at Five and was flicked into the wall on the exit, damaging the left-hand side of the car.\nHe swore over the radio that he was an \"idiot\", but was unhurt.\n\"Disappointed but I'm fine,\" Norris said. \"The team have a lot of work to do. It has been such a smooth positive weekend so far, so I'm disappointed to have such big setback. But have to take it on the chin, and try and go again tomorrow.\n\"The car is quick. It has been quick all weekend, so I have to work hard to overtake the cars tomorrow.\"\nRussell said he had \"mixed feelings\" because he felt there was more in his car, adding that he rued Mercedes' decision not to use the same strategy as Red Bull after the red flag.\nAt Ferrari, Hamilton's travails this season continued, underlined by the statistic that he has only once so far qualified higher than the seventh place he managed this weekend.\n\"I've been nowhere all weekend,\" Hamilton said. \"I am happier than I was yesterday. It really wasn't coming easy, so P7 is OK. I still have work to do to try to gel with this car.\"",

But Marko told BBC Sport this month that it contains a performance clause that could allow him to depart the team.\nThe 27-year-old has been linked with moves to Mercedes and Aston Martin for 2026 when new regulations are being introduced. He held talks with Mercedes last year but their team boss Toto Wolff said at the season-opener in Australia last month that a pitch to sign Verstappen for next season is \"not on any radar\". \nAsked in the drivers' news conference whether he would like Verstappen as a team-mate at Aston Martin, Fernando Alonso said: \"Yes, but that's unlikely to happen, very unlikely.\" \nAlonso's current team-mate is Lance Stroll, the son of Aston Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll.\nNorris being forced to drive in 'uncomfortable ways'\nHow to follow Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on the BBC\nVerstappen moved to within one point of Norris in the standings with a brilliant win at the Japanese Grand Prix from pole position two weeks ago. \nHis weekend in Sakhir was a stark contrast to the highs of Suzuka as he qualified in seventh and finished the race three places lower than Briton Norris, who ended his day on the podium in third. \nVerstappen continued: \"I just go race by race. I think [Saudi Arabia] will be better than Bahrain. The rest is out of my hands. \n\"At the moment, we are not the quickest so it is tough to fight for a championship, but it is a long road. Last year here it all looked great and we know how the season ended up.\" \nRed Bull were untouchable in Jeddah last year with Verstappen first and then team-mate Sergio Perez second. But while the Dutchman went on to seal his fourth title in a row, Red Bull lost out to McLaren in the constructors' championship, eventually dropping behind Ferrari and finishing third. \n\"I enjoyed last year and the year before when we were dominant,\" said Verstappen. \n\"Now it is enjoyable in a way of the challenges that are out there and trying to improve the situation I would say.\n\"I am happy, I am not very happy with my car. But we all want to be better, there is no secret in that. We all want to improve.\" \nThis video can not be played\nFive things to know before the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix",

It has been trying to reassure everyone that the country is strong and the economy is resilient enough to weather this latest storm.\nBut this week, Chinese officials have acknowledged the potential for economic pain as a result of the unfolding trade war with the US.\nOne option for policymakers here is to try to increase domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue.\nChina has a massive population and, if they start buying more stuff, Chinese companies won't have to rely as much on trade overseas.\nA key target in this endeavour are retirees with potentially decades of savings.\nNow the government wants them to spend some of it - for the good of the country. \nAnd initiatives like the \"silver trains\" - which are tailored specifically to older travellers - aim to do just that.\nOn board the Star Express, the cocktails are poured and the karaoke microphone is passed around, as retirees party their way through China's south-western Yunnan province. \nThe roast goose is being devoured with shots of baijiu, a Chinese white spirit alcohol.\n\"We have been working hard all these years,\" says 66-year-old Daniel Ling, who is travelling with a group of retired or semi-retired friends.\n\"The important thing when we reach this age, is to know what is the right thing to do - and that is to really enjoy life.\"\nThe initiative hopes to turn an economic problem into an economic solution by giving older people a fun avenue to spend more.\nFamilies are not spending enough because they don't feel financially safe - the property crisis has diminished the value of their number one asset: their home. And growing unemployment has also potentially made their job less secure.\nAdd to the mix an ageing population and low birthrates and the proportion of retirees grows each year, making it harder for the economy to support them.\nBut what retirees do have is time on their hands and money to spend. \nSo now they are to be given more opportunities to splurge with special trains designed to take them to sites they might not normally visit - parts of the country further afield, which need a financial shot in the arm.\n\"The main places where the silver trains will stop are undeveloped rural areas or small towns with struggling economies,\" says Dr Huang Huang, a research associate from the China Tourism Academy who has been studying the potential impact of this plan.\n\"They will consume various products on the trains, but after they pull into a station, they will also visit tourist attractions and traditional villages.\"\nIn Baisha, the travellers stop by the modest street stalls at the bottom of old, two-storey, wooden houses built by the local Naxi ethnic minority.\nOne of them approaches a vendor selling barbecued strips of yak meat. They look tasty and she buys a bagful. The vendor's husband, who is also working at the stall, says this business is only a year old and that they need outside customers to survive.\nAll along this street you can get potatoes with spicy sauce, lamb skewers, fresh orange juice and the traditional clothing of the Naxi people. \nThis is a region where incomes are low and most young people leave when they reach a certain age because there are hardly any jobs for them.\nIt is also not an easy place for many retirees to reach, but these silver trains make it possible, with easy access to boarding and alighting, and with staff to help as well as extra medical support if required.\nShi Lili, 69, whose granddaughter is accompanying her, says the travelling spirit of her youth has been rekindled: \"When I was young I really liked exploring other places by myself. Now I'm older, I have my family who can go with me.\"\nBy the end of last year, 22% of China's population were over the age of 60, making up more than 310 million people.\nSo, if only the smallest percentage of China's retirees take \"silver trains\", it can still mean millions of ticket sales. And China's railway authorities say they plan to be operating 100 routes within the next three years.\nSuch trips alone are not going to fix China's massive challenge with low consumer spending. But economists would say these moves are a step in the right direction. \nOlder citizens now have a much greater desire to travel compared to previous generations, creating \"huge potential\", according to Dr Huang.\n\"Given that China's ageing population is now a reality going into the long run - something which is unlikely to the reversed - we should find more opportunities from this rather than always turning it into a challenge.\"\nBack on board the train, the silver adventurers are ready to crash out. And they can do so knowing that their big day out was - at least partly - for the benefit of all.\nThen it's onto the next town.",

It is unclear how many tickets have been sold to date.\nNo line-up for the festival has been announced.\nLast year, Andy King, an investor in the first Fyre Festival, issued a warning to anyone interested in going to its planned reboot: \"Proceed with caution.\"\nMr King, who lost $1m in the original debacle, told the BBC that McFarland was \"known for the biggest failure in pop culture and wants to flip the script.

I want to stay in football but if I can't find anything - there are not that many professional teams in England in the women's game - then I need to look at maybe going back into estate agency work or something like that,\" added Beard.\n\"It would probably be a last resort for me. But at the end of the day I have a family I need to support. I need to look at all options.\"\nBeard believes losing his job is \"part and parcel\" of being a football manager and he was supported by the League Managers' Association (LMA) when he left Liverpool.\nBut his family moved up to north-west England from London, where the children started new schools, and he is conscious of disrupting things as he contemplates his next steps. \n\"I want to stay in the game and continue managing. I have my pro licence and degree in business management,\" said Beard. \n\"I think people see me as a fixer who can build something but I know I'm much more than that when I look back at my time as a football manager.\n\"Roles like a technical director or sporting director are something I would maybe consider. I might also look at high performance workshops or even podcasts.\"\nBeard left Liverpool on strong terms having guided the club to back-to-back WSL titles in 2013 and 2014 during his first spell, before winning the Women's Championship in 2022 on his return.\nHe says getting sacked with a year and a half left on his contract was \"difficult\" but he only has respect for the club and the support they gave him.\n\"It was going to happen at some point in my career,\" said Beard.\n\"You have to take emotions out of the conversation. I have no qualms with the decision but I still think we would have finished in the top five this season. \n\"It's frustrating losing your job. Was I owed time? I don't know. I have nothing but pride when I look at the journey. \n\"I have a great relationship with the club and the people. I respected the decision and it's just one of those things. I'm ready to go again now.\"\nTime away has allowed Beard to reflect on the state of the game and what it was like competing financially with WSL leaders Chelsea.\nHe says other clubs must find ways to invest and grow simultaneously - but not at the expense of losing their connection with the fanbase. \n\"I think you've seen the game grow so much in such a short space of time. I'm always concerned that we run before we walk,\" added Beard.\n\"I have always been an advocate for the bond we have with the fans. That's what makes our game unique and I don't want to see that go.\n\"I also look at Chelsea and the money they have spent\u2026 who can compete with that? They spent more on two players than we did on our entire squad. It's crazy.\n\"It's everyone else's problem. Arsenal have got it right, I think. They can compete financially, they have marketed their games well and get good crowds at the Emirates. I think that's probably the way forward.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "From the latest season of the dystopian workplace drama to the UK miniseries that got the world talking and a new hit medical show, we pick the year's greatest programmes to stream right now.\nHollywood is an easy target, but this satire is so sharp, astute and sometimes absurd that it may be the funniest show of the year. Seth Rogen, who co-created the show, plays Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of Continental Studios, a lover of high-art films with a mandate to make commercial hits based on IP including Kool-Aid. A flood of actors and directors \u2013 including Ron Howard, Olivia Wilde and Zoe Kravitz \u2013 make cameo appearances, gleefully spoofing their own images, none funnier than Martin Scorsese in the hilarious opening episode. The series regulars are ideally cast, with Ike Barniholtz as Sal Saperstein, Matt's second-in-command, Catherine O'Hara as the previous studio head and Kathryn Hahn as the loud, wackily-dressed head of publicity. Taking us into the Golden Globes and marketing meetings, The Studio suggests that everyone is just bumbling along at a moment when the entire movie industry is in crisis. The industry might not know where it's going, but this behind-the-scenes comedy is a pure delight. (CJ)\nAvailable on Apple TV+ internationally\nOne thing's for sure: if Mike White's first-world-problems satire about rich holidaymakers was admired by many for its first two seasons, it broke out to become a true cultural phenomenon in its third, with a huge ratings boost. This time round, it sent its dysfunctional groupings \u2013 a corrupt financier and his family, three clashing female friends, a vengeful man and his younger girlfriend \u2013 to a Thai wellness retreat, and every week, you could not move online (metaphorically) for the discourse it generated and debate it stirred. Some complained that this season was too slow and lacked\u00a0suitable plot momentum, while others pointed out, sagely, that the problem was that it was a character-led drama that was never meant to be dissected like Game\u00a0of Thrones, but for its unexpected blockbuster popularity. Personally? I enjoyed it as both the darkest and most reflective series so far, but one which again thrived off a magisterially cast ensemble, in which Parker Posey, Carrie Coon, Aimee Lou Wood and Patrick Schwarzenegger were standouts, but no one was a weak link. (HM)\nAvailable on Max in the US and Now in the UK\u00a0\nIt's no wonder that this uncompromising British series about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl in his school has become a cultural flashpoint, praised by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, made available to be shown in schools and sparking conversations about young men and the toxic influence of social media. The social issue is wrapped in a drama brilliantly personalized and brought to life by the actors. Stephen Graham, who created the show with Jack Thorne, plays the boy's father and conveys the shock and grief of a parent forced to consider the unthinkable possibility that his son might be a killer. Owen Cooper gives a remarkably sophisticated performance as the accused boy, who seems guileless until he explodes in anger. And Ashley Waters plays a detective who struggles to understand his own teenage son, expanding the theme beyond one family. Each episode was shot in a single, real-time take, which sounds like a gimmick, but director Philip Barantini handles that approach so smoothly that it fades into the background, even while adding intensity to a piercing drama that offers no comfortable resolution. (CJ)\nAvailable on Netflix internationally\nFairly or not, Apple TV+ has become a streamer known for ploughing huge resources (\nover $20bn, reportedly\n) into a range of starry shows that not very many people watch \u2013 but with the second series of this dystopian workplace drama, it became clear it had a genuine watercooler hit on its hands. Which is even more surprising, when you consider just how strange Severance is. Its compelling high-concept premise \u2013 in which employees of the sinister Lumon corporation have their consciousness separated into office selves, or \"innies\", and home selves, or \"outies\" \u2013 is one thing, but beyond that, it is constantly taking the story down surreal rabbit holes, involving for example, mysterious \"macrodata refinement\" work or a herd of goats. In truth, as this series progressed through its second half, it felt a little too meandering for its own good, and its climactic payoff couldn't match that from the first season. But it's still an exquisite work in all areas, from the clever dual-identity acting (especially from shining star Britt Lower) to the stark visuals. Bring on season three, and perhaps a few more solid answers as to what's\n really\n going on at Lumon. (HM)\nAvailable on Apple TV+ internationally\u00a0\nIt might sound like just another medical drama, but this show about a trauma centre in Pittsburgh revitalises the genre with its attention to the psychological stress on caregivers. Noah Wyle gives a shattering performance as the department head, the dedicated, harried, emotionally wracked Dr Robbie, still traumatised after failing to save his mentor during the Covid-19 pandemic. He is surrounded by other doctors and a group of students and interns, each adding a different dimension, from Supriya Ganesh as a brilliant medical prodigy to Isa Briones as an abrasive intern and Taylor Dearden as the caring Dr Mel, whose neurodivergence makes her especially empathetic with her patients. Unlike most medical shows, The Pitt never lets their personal melodrama overwhelm the focus on their work. Each absorbing, fast-paced episode takes place in real time during one 15-hour-long shift, and each veers between the devastation of losing patients and the relief of saving them. You'd think a series so blunt about death would be depressing, but instead The Pitt is exhilarating in its focus on people for whom life and death are everyday events. (CJ)\nAvailable on Max in the US\nIt's difficult to discuss the power of this show without giving away the key twist that comes at the end of episode one. But safe to say, it turns what starts as a relatively conventional political thriller on its head. Sterling K Brown is the head of the US president's security detail, who finds himself accused of murder of his boss \u2013 but above and beyond the killing itself, not everything seems quite right with the world. Created by Dan Fogelman, the man behind the equally rug-pulling TV weepie This is Us, this is solid entertainment in the very best sense, with sharp plotting matched by some strong performances, from Brown\u2019s tortured hero to Julianne Nicholson as a sinister tech billionaire. Plus, later on in the series, one particular episode which deals with truly monumental matters is simply breathtaking \u2013 but again, that's all that can be said without spoiling things for those yet to watch. The good news for those that have is that it's already been recommissioned. (HM)\nAvailable on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally\u00a0\nThe sumptuous conclusion to this adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall trilogy blends a beautifully shot escape into the luxurious past of Henry VIII's court with an evergreen depiction of the high personal cost of manoeuvring for power and influence. Mark Rylance is poignant as the king's advisor, Thomas Cromwell, who questions his own decisions, while the mercurial Henry is losing confidence in him. And Damian Lewis's fresh interpretation of Henry is dazzling, his voice and manner chillingly subdued even as he issues the most ruthless commands. Henry's wives come and go, but the unravelling bond between these men, and their opposite trajectories \u2013 Cromwell's self-doubts and decline and Henry's iron will that eliminates anyone in his way \u2013 shape the story. Written by Peter Straughn, a recent Oscar winner for his screenplay of Conclave, The Mirror and the Light is more resonant today than the original Mantel book was when it was published in 2020. It feels entirely relevant in a world where creeping authoritarianism is a global concern. (CJ)\nAvailable on PBS in the US and BBC iPlayer in the UK\nSince breaking out in HBO teen drama Euphoria, rising star Jacob Elordi has chosen his roles well \u2013 but perhaps nothing has served him better so far than returning to his home country of Australia to play the protagonist in this searing war drama. An adaptation of Richard Flanagan's Booker Prize-winning novel, it explores the life of World War Two army surgeon Dorrigo Evans across three time periods: his stint stationed in Adelaide for military training, his hellish experiences as a prisoner of war in the Thai jungle, and then his existence as a professionally successful but emotionally deeply troubled veteran (now played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), still unable to truly process the events of decades ago. Brought to impactful visual life by Justin Kurzel, known for his visceral studies of male violence on the big screen like Snowtown and The Order, it is simply one of the best evocations of the horrors of conflict that has been committed to screen. But at the same time, it takes as much care in its exploration of passion as violence, with the chemistry between Elordi's young Dorrigo and his uncle's wife Amy (a superb Odessa Young) burning up the screen. Given some of the scenes of sadistic brutality, it is of course a difficult watch, as it should be, but also one whose sheer artistry offers a kind of transcendence. (HM)\u00a0\nAvailable on Prime Video in the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada\nJon Hamm has never been better, expertly mixing comedy and drama in this series about a hedge-fund manager called Coop, who loses his job. He schemes to keep up appearances in his wealthy community, only to discover a new sense of himself. The show has a broad comic element, as Coop turns cat burglar, solving his financial problems by stealing luxury items from his neighbours. But the series is best in its bold take on what he calls in one of his mordant voiceovers, \"the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\", and in its depiction of his complicated relationships. He is still emotionally attached to his ex-wife (Amanda Peet), who left him for one of his friends, and struggles to connect with his two teenage children. He has a tender, supportive bond with his emotionally fragile sister (Lena Hall, a standout in the cast). Hamm hasn't had a role this rich since Don Draper in Mad Men, another flawed but sympathetic charmer who makes some wildly bad decisions, and defines the character so perfectly that it's hard to imagine anyone else at the centre of this sleek but penetrating series. (CJ)\nAvailable on AppleTV+ internationally\nIt might have created a little less noise than Adolescence, but here is another British show about masculinity that really deserves to be seen. Jack Rooke's semi-autobiographical show about two university students who form an odd-couple friendship \u2013 nerdy gay man Jack and straight jack-the-lad Dan \u2013 has been an incredibly deft mix of laugh-out-loud humour, complete with delightfully niche pop culture references, and poignant drama \u2013 covering sexual awakening, depression, dementia and more besides \u2013 since it started in 2022. But this third and final series was undoubtedly its most powerful, kicking off with a hilarious episode on a package holiday in Greece but getting more serious as it continued, and handling Danny's spiralling mental health problems with particular skill. And boy, does Rooke know how to shatter audience hearts \u2013 the final episode is an emotional masterclass, including a significant cameo from the man himself. Here's hoping that it launches its extremely talented creator into the big time.

There was no toolbox, I had no-one to talk to about how I was meant to feel \u2013 so I just felt angry.\n\"Angry with myself for maybe not pushing more \u2013 angry with the NHS for taking one look at me and dismissing me because of my age, my demographic.\"\nThe actor's symptoms had developed over a number of months in 2021, and when she returned from three months filming in Spain she spoke to her GP about back pain and bloating. \nShe was referred for a scan, which revealed a four inch (10cm) tumour on her right ovary.\nAfter further investigations, she said a multi-disciplinary team at the hospital in Nottingham talked her through the results.\n\"They said because of my age, and the sort of cells that were inside my tumour, times that by X, multiply this by Y and Z - you don't have cancer,\" she said. \n\nShalisha was told there was a six-month wait for surgery to remove the tumour.\nShe returned to the set of Casualty, relieved not to have cancer, but still with a distended stomach and \"excruciating pain\".\n\"Bless the costume department - I couldn't really tell anyone, so I asked if they could just make my scrubs a bit bigger, because I couldn't have people thinking I was pregnant,\" she said. \nNot even Shalisha's family knew cancer was a possibility, as she did not want to scare them without knowing the full facts.\n\"It was a very lonely experience because it was just me and my husband going through this,\" she said. \nThings came to a head in the spring of 2022.\n\"One morning in early March I woke the whole house up screaming - my tumour was twisting inside my abdomen,\" Shalisha said. \n\"I couldn't keep painkillers down so we had to call an ambulance.\"\nFollowing surgery, doctors discovered the 12 inch by 12 inch (30cm x 30cm) tumour was mucinous ovarian cancer.\n\"I didn't let anyone apart from my husband and my best friend come and visit me in hospital, because I didn't want to see in my mum's eyes how sick I looked,\" Shalisha said. \nShe said processing her diagnosis also came with challenges, adding: \"The pamphlets and websites never showed anyone younger than 40, let alone a black woman.\"\nShe credits the nurses volunteering with charity Black Women Rising with saving her life.\n\"There were times where I was at a point that if I didn't speak to someone right then, I was going to lose my mind and spiral \u2013 and I didn't know how to climb out of that,\" Shalisha said. \n\"But even within that community, I still haven't met a young woman with mucinous ovarian cancer who is of my Caribbean heritage.\n\"There's a lot of culture there \u2013 a rich history that is instilled into me \u2013 of having my own back and being strong, and I needed another woman to be like 'girl, I get it, I understand'.\"\nShalisha also praised the after-care she received from the oncology team in Cardiff, but said her cancer had changed \"every single facet of life\" including her attitude to her own body.\nWhen she awoke from surgery she had around 29 staples down her stomach.\n\"It took me a long time to look in the mirror, and a while before I started to see how incredible it is and what it represents,\" she said. \n\"Every time I get changed I'm reminded of what my body went through \u2013 but three years on I'm so proud of this tiny body that has got me to where I am now.\"\nSince leaving Casualty in 2024 Shalisha has taken on a number of theatre roles, presented Saying Yes to Life for BBC Radio wales, and also worked with charities to raise awareness of ovarian cancer, even though talking about it can still be difficult.\n\"People assume because I'm an actor I'm good at talking - but in work people write lines for me,\" she added.\n\"Speaking about my experience is completely new to me.\"\n\"Mucinous ovarian cancer is a rare form of cancer and the complexities of a case can make it challenging to diagnose,\" said Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust's director of nursing and professions Rachel Boardman.\n\"However, where there are concerns, various tests and scans are used to identify the cancer, which would be assessed at a multidisciplinary level, in order to maintain an accurate diagnosis and a treatment plan to be delivered as quickly as possible.\"\nAsk Eve nurse Helen Hyndman said: \"I speak to many young women who get in touch with Ask Eve for advice who struggled to get their diagnosis of one of the five gynaecological cancers.\n\"Women tell me that they felt that because of their age, they were seen as 'too young' for cancer to be investigated.\"\nThere are five gynaecological cancers - womb, ovarian, cervical, vulval and vaginal.\nMs Hyndman said: \"The symptoms of the five cancers include abnormal vaginal bleeding, unexplained pelvic pain, changes to bladder or bowel habits or vulva itching, all of which can be caused by other much more common and less serious conditions. \n\"This means it's usually appropriate to test for other conditions before checking for cancer in younger women and people with gynae organs. \n\"But if you can't find a cause, or your symptoms persist or worsen, don't be afraid to mention the word cancer to your doctor and ask for tests.\"",

        "article_text": "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.\nBut slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate. \nChina has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.\nThe move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.\nThis week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war? \n\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.\nMost are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.\nAlthough you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.\nFor instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.\nYttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.\nRare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.\nChina has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.\nThat means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.\nBoth the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting. \nAll rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.\n\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.\nBut China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.\nIn a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\". \n\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.\n\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"\nIn response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector. \nThese are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.\nFrom 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.\nThat is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".\nAccording to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.\nA US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.\nThis means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.\nHeavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.\nA CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.\nIt adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".\n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.\nAnd it's not only in the field of defence.\nUS manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.\n\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.\n\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies. \nIf such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".\nAnd it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals. \n\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.\n\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"\nThe US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.\nThere used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.\nBut these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.\nThis is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.\nAnother place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements. \nTrump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it. \nThese might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.\n\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper. \n\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\"",

        "article_text": "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.\nA Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.\nThis is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\nBut the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.\nThe lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.\n\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"\nK2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.\nJWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.\nThe Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.\nProf Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.\n\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.\n\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.\nProf Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"\nHe told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.\n\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"\nDr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".\nHe added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"\nThere are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.\nFirstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery. \nFor that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result. \nThese latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.\nBut even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.\n\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.\n\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"\nThat view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.\n\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.\nSuggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"\nHe said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".\nOther research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.\nThe reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below. \nBut it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.\n\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.\n\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"\nDr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface. \nBoth these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, compounding the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.\nProf Chris Lintott, presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night, said he had \"great admiration\" for Prof Madhusudhan's team, but was treating the research with caution.\n\"I think we've got to be very careful about claiming that this is 'a moment' on the search to life. We've [had] such moments before,\" he told Today.\nHe said the research should be seen instead as \"part of a huge effort to try and understand what's out there in the cosmos\".\nProf Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.\n\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.\n\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"\nThe research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "summary": "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet2 days agoShareSavePallab GhoshScience Correspondent\u2022@BBCPallabShareSaveCambridge UniversityArtwork of K2-18b, a faraway world that may be home to lifeScientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon. \"Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. \"Could this faraway world be home to life?K2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS).",

        "article_text": "Healthcare in the Gaza Strip is itself a casualty of 18 months of war between Israel and Hamas. With doctors struggling to cope, the BBC followed one GP through her shift at a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) clinic.\nBy 07:30, a slight figure in a pink headscarf, Dr Wissam Sukkar, is picking her way through the devastated streets of Gaza City.\n\"I was walking for around 50 minutes to reach our clinic,\" she explains when she is met by a local BBC journalist who helped us log her day. With virtually no fuel left in Gaza, few taxis are running.\n\"With our limited resources we're still trying to be here in northern Gaza through these difficult times,\" adds Dr Sukkar.\nThe UN's World Health Organization (WHO) says that only 21 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are currently partially functional. Medical supplies are running critically low due to Israel's ongoing blockade of Gaza.\nThe GP points out what is left of her former workplace, an MSF burns clinic that came under fire in the early weeks of the war, during street battles between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters.\nHer team has now converted an office towards the west of Gaza City into a clinic - and by 09:30, as Dr Sukkar is putting on her white robe, there are already some 150 people waiting outside in a tented reception area.\n\"Most of our patients are displaced people,\" Dr Sukkar says. \"They live in shelters, they even live in tents in the streets.\"\nSince a ceasefire collapsed a month ago, thousands of Gazans have once again left their homes and fled to this neighbourhood, seeking safety.\nWith little food and clean water, there is a rise in malnutrition and diseases - from stomach bugs to scabies. The elderly and young are worst affected, and the first patients of the day are babies with viral infections.\n\"We receive a lot of children who suffer from upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea. In the shelters, there are a lot of children in the same place and a virus can spread very quickly,\" the doctor explains.\nOne toddler has his face dotted with mosquito bites and Dr Sukkar administers some soothing cream. As cooking gas has run out, families have taken to using open fires to heat food and this has also led to an increase in serious burns.\nWithin an hour, Dr Sukkar and three other physicians have seen dozens of patients. But there are many whom they struggle to help.\n\"We have more and more challenges with the huge number of patients with less and less medical supplies,\" Dr Sukkar says wearily.\n\"Also, we receive complicated cases, and we don't know where to refer these patients because the health system in Gaza has collapsed.\"\nThere has been an influx in seriously wounded patients arriving at the clinic since last Sunday, when Israeli warplanes attacked al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City.\nIsrael accused Hamas of using a hospital building as a \"command and control centre\"; something the armed group denied.\nAl-Ahli - which was the main medical site for treating trauma in northern Gaza - can no longer accept patients. The WHO says the emergency room, laboratory, X-ray machines and pharmacy were destroyed.\n\"I started my treatment at al-Shifa hospital, then I got transferred to al-Ahli and they bombed it,\" says Saeed Barkat, an older man with a fractured thigh bone, who arrives at the MSF clinic on crutches.\nHe had surgery after he was wounded by Israeli artillery fire on the shelter where he was staying late last year. He has pins in his leg, and it is swollen.\n\"I came here for any treatment and to follow-up,\" says Mr Barkat, as nurses change his dressing and give new painkillers.\nAt midday, when Dr Sukkar checks on the small pharmacy at the clinic, she looks worried. Many of the shelves are bare.\nIsrael closed all crossings to Gaza at the start of March, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages it is holding. Since then, no aid has entered.\n\"For diabetes, we don't have insulin, we don't have treatments for epilepsy, we don't have basic medicines like anti-fever drugs,\" Dr Sukkar says.\n\"It's the season for skin infections and we don't have creams or ointments for bacterial infections, no medicines to treat scabies and head lice.\"\nThe doctors are rationing the supplies that remain.\n\"We are doing our best so that it will be enough for the coming week,\" sums up Dr Sukkar, \"but we expect that our stock will run out in more or less two weeks.\"\nSoon Dr Sukkar is back in her consultation room. The rush of patients continues with many more sick children. They have coughs, fevers and stomach upsets.\nBy 15:30, it is time to close up the clinic for the day. The four doctors here calculate that they have seen nearly 390 patients.\nAfter a long, tiring day, there is the long, tiring walk home for Dr Sukkar.\nAs she leaves the clinic she telephones her family. Her thoughts turn to looking after her own children, who have been displaced with her nine times in the past year and a half.\n\"Like every Gazan, I have a daily struggle to secure clean water, food for my kids,\" says Dr Sukkar. \"We don't have electricity, so it's really hard even to charge the battery of my mobile.\"\n\"Most of all, it's really hard to have any hope,\" she goes on. \"I feel I live in a nightmare that doesn't end. When will this war end?\"\nFor now, there is no answer, and no respite.",

        "article_text": "Washington and Kyiv are moving closer to signing a deal involving Ukraine's mineral deposits, almost two months after President Volodymyr Zelensky first travelled to the US to finalise it - but failed to do so.\nDetails are still emerging about what the latest version of the agreement would include, but previous leaks suggest it may include control of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, oil and gas, in addition to minerals.\nA signed memorandum of intent, published by the Ukrainian government on 18 April, says the countries intend to set up an investment fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine as part of an economic partnership. Kyiv and Washington aim to finalise the text by 26 April, the memo says.\nThe initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but it was derailed after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Zelensky turned into a public shouting match.\nThe memo released on Friday contains broad statements, saying the US and Ukraine \"intend to establish a reconstruction investment fund as part of an economic partnership between the two peoples and governments\".\nIt provides no detail as to how this fund would work, nor does it mention the word \"minerals\" at all.\nIt also does not include the promise of a security guarantee from the US, something Zelensky has pushed hard for throughout negotiations.\nTrump, for his part, has suggested a deal could act as compensation for US military aid given to Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. \nThe memo does not explicitly frame the agreement in this way, but it does make note of the US's \"significant financial and material support\" for Ukraine.\nUkrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko acknowledged the text of the final document was still being worked on, but said she expected the deal to be \"very beneficial for both countries\".\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal previously said the fund would be managed by Kyiv and Washington on \"equal terms\".\nClues about the agreement might be found in previous leaks, as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the current deal was \"substantially what we'd agreed on previously\".\n\"When the president [Zelensky] was here, we had a memorandum of understanding,\" said Bessent, who signed the memo over a video call with Svyrydenko.\n\"We went straight to the big deal, and I think it's an 80-page agreement and that's what we'll be signing,\" he added.\nThe text prepared in February was never officially shared, but a version was published by Ukrainian media ahead of Zelensky's meeting with Trump.\nIt envisaged Ukraine contributing 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to an investment fund, which would be used \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\". \nIt also said the US would \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nSince that draft was published, multiple sources have told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the updated version would be different.\nThe extent of this change, though, remains unclear.\nDisagreement over the terms formed part of a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky, days before he travelled to Washington to sign it.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but this demand was dropped from the version published online.\nFriday's memo says the final agreement was still being worked out, with Shmyhal due to visit Washington next week to conclude \"technical discussions\".\nZelensky has long called for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nFriday's signed memo does not promise such a guarantee.\nIt does, however, say that both the Kyiv and Washington \"desire a lasting peace in Ukraine\".\nThe version of the deal published in February says the US \"supports Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees\" but does not promise one explicitly.  \nTrump has suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act in itself as a security guarantee, but responsibility for Ukraine's security would now fall to Europe.\nThe US president has previously said Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals.\nBoth countries aim to complete discussions by 26 April, with the aim of signing a final deal \"as soon as possible\", according to the memo.\nTrump has said he hopes to sign the deal sooner, by 24 April.\n\"We have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday... next Thursday. Soon. And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see. But we have a deal on that,\" he said this week.\nTrump had previously said he and Zelensky would sign the deal during February's meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said a final version of the agreement had been prepared ahead of that meeting, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead descended into a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Svyrydenko, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's land mass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC.\nBefore the deal was supposed to be signed in February, Vladimir Putin told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.",

The deceased were not students, campus police said, but their identities have not been released. \nThe suspect is the son of a veteran Leon County police officer who is a model employee, said Sheriff Walt McNeil. Jessica Ikner, a school resource officer, kept the gun after the force upgraded its weapons.\nA shotgun was also found at the scene, police said. \nThe suspect was a \"longstanding member\" of the sheriff office's youth advisory council and was engaged in a number of training programmes, Sheriff McNeil said.\n\"So it is not a surprise that he had access to weapons,\" he said.\nThe suspect was a protester at a campus demonstration against President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, according to the student newspaper.\nHis quote to FSUNews.com was removed on Thursday with an editors note saying the outlet did not wish to amplify the suspect's voice.\nPolice responded to an active shooter call at around midday local time, the university said. An alert was issued warning students and those on campus to \"seek shelter and await further instructions\".\n\"One of my classmates got an alert on her phone and announced it to the rest of the class,\" student Ava Arenado told CBS News Miami.\nAnother student, Blake Leonard, told CBS he initially heard roughly 12 shots fired.\n\"In my head, I thought it was construction at first, until I looked behind me and saw people running from the union towards my direction, and then I heard another 12 or 15 shots go off, so I started running away from there too,\" he said.\nPresident Donald Trump, who said he was briefed on the incident before meeting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White House, was asked whether he wanted to change gun regulations in light of the shooting.\nHe said he was a \"big advocate\" of the Second Amendment in the US Constitution, which protects gun rights.\n\"I have been since the beginning,\" he said. \"I have protected it. These things are terrible. We will have more to say about it later.\" \nHe called the shooting \"a shame, a horrible thing\".\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said: \"Our prayers are with our FSU family and state law enforcement is actively responding.\"\nThis is not the first shooting at FSU. In 2015, a graduate of the school shot and injured three people at the library before he was fatally shot by police.\nThe father of a girl who was killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Parkland High School in Florida said some of her classmates who were lucky enough to survive that attack were on the campus at FSU during Thursday's assault.\nFred Guttenberg, a gun control advocate, wrote on X: \"Incredibly, some of them were just a part of their 2nd school shooting and some were in the student union today.\"",

        "article_text": "Jai Field has now scored 12 tries for Wigan Warriors this season and has scored a try in all but one game in 2025\nBetfred Super League\nWigan (12) 24\nTries: Field 2, Miski 2 Goals: Smith 4\nSt Helens (2) 14\nTries: Murphy, Paasi Goals: Whitby 3\nJai Field and Abbas Miski scored two tries apiece to lead Wigan Warriors to victory in their Good Friday derby despite a strong St Helens comeback in the second half.\nField, Super League's leading try scorer, scored either side of a Miski score to give the reigning champions a commanding 18-2 lead early in the second half.\nSaints looked down and out as both sides committed errors in a tense encounter, but Lewis Murphy's brilliant finish in the corner and a powerhouse try from Agnatius Paasi dragged them back to within four points.\nWith new signing Christian Wade watching from the stands, Wigan clinched it with a late Miski try to move on to the shoulder of pace-setters Hull Kingston Rovers at the top of the table.\nAfter suffering two defeats in March, the reigning champions have now won three on the bounce to move two points behind the Robins, and they made a powerful statement with a dominant performance against their old rivals from the other side of Billinge Hill.\nIn front of a sell-out 25,000 crowd at the Brick Community Stadium, the two sides exchanged penalties in a cagey start, with Field having a try chalked off by video referee Liam Rush, who spotted that Tyler Dupree has obstructed George Delaney's attempted tackle.\nA few minutes later, Field nailed a try which did count, timing his run to perfection to gather Bevan French's exquisite lobbed kick and score under the posts.\nWigan turned the screw and, when the influential Harry Smith put up a testing kick, French got a telling touch that went backwards and Miski had acres of space to go over and extend their lead.\nMoses Mbye's shoulder barge to the head of Zach Eckersley further hindered Saints as the Saints hooker trooped off to the sin-bin, but shortly into the second half the numbers were evened up as Sam Walters caught Jon Bennison high and was shown a yellow card.\nGloucester's Wade to join Wigan in cross-code switch\nHull KR resist 12-man Hull FC to win derby thriller\nFive-try Leeds ease past winless Huddersfield\nPaasi handed Wigan what seemed to be the winning try, by trying a silly offload deep in his own territory. The Warriors were ruthless, and Smith sent Field racing through for his second try.\nWith Joe Batchelor limping off with an apparent hamstring injury and Jon Bennison needing a head injury assessment, Saints looked finished but they rallied well to stage a grand ending.\nWigan started to make uncharacteristic errors and when one from Liam Byrne gifted them possession, Tristan Sailor gave Murphy a chance which he finished with a spectacular leap in the corner.\nBuoyed up, Saints went surging forwards and when Jake Wardle also spilled the ball in front of his own posts, Paasi made up for his earlier mistake by powering over despite being decorated by three tacklers.\nInside nine minutes, the lead had been cut to four points, but the travelling fans' belief dissipated as Sailor sought to launch another attack but dropped the ball, allowing Eckersley to scoop it up and send Miski over to make sure of Wigan's third win over their rivals on the trot.\nWigan head coach Matty Peet told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\"It's great learning for us, when you look at the period where we had to ride out the pressure.

The Warriors were ruthless, and Smith sent Field racing through for his second try.With Joe Batchelor limping off with an apparent hamstring injury and Jon Bennison needing a head injury assessment, Saints looked finished but they rallied well to stage a grand ending.Wigan started to make uncharacteristic errors and when one from Liam Byrne gifted them possession, Tristan Sailor gave Murphy a chance which he finished with a spectacular leap in the corner.Buoyed up, Saints went surging forwards and when Jake Wardle also spilled the ball in front of his own posts, Paasi made up for his earlier mistake by powering over despite being decorated by three tacklers.Inside nine minutes, the lead had been cut to four points, but the travelling fans' belief dissipated as Sailor sought to launch another attack but dropped the ball, allowing Eckersley to scoop it up and send Miski over to make sure of Wigan's third win over their rivals on the trot. \"The way these games are played, players like that [Field and Miski] have the skill but they've also got to be very tough and physical to survive out there, and show what they can do when they have the chance. \"St Helens coach Paul Wellens told BBC Radio Merseyside:\"I'm slightly frustrated with the way we started the game for the first 40 minutes.

        "article_text": "After decades in prison, Erik and Lyle Menendez have a chance at being resentenced - and possibly freed - in a murder case that still divides America.  \nThe pair, who are serving life in prison for the murder of their parents, appeared in a Los Angeles court via video stream on Thursday as a judge readied to hear arguments whether they should or should not be resentenced at a long-anticipated hearing. \nThe pair are serving life in prison for killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, in 1989, when they were 21 and 18. Their case gained renewed attention after a popular Netflix series last year.\nAfter a contentious start to the proceedings on Thursday, the judge ultimately decided to postpone the resentencing hearing until next month. \nThe hearing will determine whether the pair should be resentenced to a lesser penalty. If approved, the brothers could become eligible for parole - potentially allowing their freedom. \nProsecutors have argued Erik and Lyle meticulously planned the killings so they could access their parents' fortune. The current Los Angeles District Attorney says the brothers have continued to cling to lies about the case and should not be freed.\nBut the brothers' lawyers have long argued the killings were an act of self-defence and claimed their father abused them for years. They have also pointed to court filings detailing their rehabilitation during their years behind bars. \nHere is how Thursday's hearing unravelled, what comes next - and a recap of how we got here. \nThe brothers shot and killed their parents with shotguns at their Beverly Hills mansion, but there has long been a debate over their motive.\nProsecutors painted them during their trials as spoiled rich kids who wanted to access their parents' $14m (\u00a310.7m) fortune. They argued that the duo methodically planned the killings, buying shotguns and opening fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.\nThe brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered film and record label executive. \nThe brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.\nIt ended deadlocked, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a second trial during which the judge barred many of their claims of sexual abuse. They are imprisoned near San Diego.\nThe hearing on Thursday got a contentious start - and ultimately led to the judge postponing the proceedings until next month. \nThe day started with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office making a last-minute request to postpone the hearing so the court could examine a new report done by the state's parole board. \nThe report, a risk assessment, examined whether the brothers pose a risk to the general public if they were to be released on parole. It was done at the request of Gov Gavin Newsom after the brothers asked him for clemency in their case, another avenue Erik and Lyle have been chasing in hopes of being freed from prison. \nThe hearing went forward and attorneys representing the Menendez brothers and the victims' families launched a multi-pronged attack against the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, which is opposing the resentencing effort. \nThey accused prosecutors of violating victims' rights by displaying graphic crime scene images and creating a conflict of interest on the parole board.\nMark Geragos, a high-profile defence attorney representing the brothers, said he would ask for the district attorney's office to be recused.  \nLos Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic defended the prosecutor leading the case, Habib Balian, and the prosecutor apologised for not giving the family a notice about the gruesome photos before they were shown. \nThe judge told attorney Bryan Freedman, who is representing members of the Menendez family vying for their release, that things will come up in these hearings that will be tough for family to see and hear.\n\"If anyone is uncomfortable, they need to think about whether they should be here,\" the judge warned.\nThen after a lunch break, the judge decided he would postpone the proceedings until 9 May so he has time to mull the risk assessment report and the request for the district attorney's office to recuse. \nIf the hearing goes as planned on 9 May, the judge will look at evidence, hear from witnesses, and ultimately determine whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced. \nIt will not be a re-trial, and guilt will not be a question. Much of the focus is likely to instead be on what the brothers have done during their 30 years in prison. \nThe hearing is not being televised.\nBoth sides - lawyers for the Menendez brothers and the district attorney's office - will be able to call people to testify. \nThis could include a wide variety of individuals, from people involved in prosecuting the brothers in the 1990s or prison officials talking about the brothers' last 30 years behind bars. \nWe are likely to hear from members of the Menendez family, many of whom have become outspoken advocates for Erik and Lyle's release. But at least one member of the family has been a fierce critic of the effort to free them. \nMilton Anderson, who is Kitty Menendez's brother, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and has argued the pair should remain behind bars for the \"heinous act\".\nThe brothers appeared in court on Thursday via a video feed from prison, wearing cobalt blue prison uniforms and matching stern expressions as prosecutors and attorneys haggled over their fate.\nIt is unclear whether they will address the court as part of their resentencing bid. \nIf they did, it would mark a significant moment in the case, and would leave them open to questions from prosecutors who oppose their release.\nThe pair have previously only appeared in court remotely by video link. The BBC has asked whether they will testify. \nOn a recent episode of his podcast, their lawyer Mark Geragos said he had not decided whether to call them to the stand.\n\"I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.\"\nThe district attorney's office has similarly not said who it plans to call to testify. \nAfter the hearing happens and concludes, Judge Jesic will rule on whether the brothers should be resentenced. \nBut it is not clear when that will happen, though.\nThe judge addressed his timing on a decision at Thursday's hearing. \n\"There's no way I'm going to make a decision in the next two days to resentence,\" he told both sides. \nEven if Judge Jesic rules in favour of the brothers being resentenced, they will not be immediately released. \nWhat happens next will depend on what type of sentence the judge offers the brothers. There is a chance they could be given a new, lesser sentence that would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nBut eligibility does not guarantee release; they would still need to convince a state parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nOr the judge could opt for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe Menendez brothers filed a motion in 2023 detailing new evidence alleging childhood sexual abuse by their father, and requesting their convictions be vacated.\nThe evidence included an allegation of rape from a former member of boy band Menudo, Roy Rossell\u00f3, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse.\nThe top LA prosecutor at the time, George Gasc\u00f3n, announced that he was supporting the resentencing bid, days before an election in November 2024. He denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long time coming.\nGasc\u00f3n's announcement came shortly after a popular Netflix documentary and TV drama welcomed a new generation to the case. Many of the brothers' supporters suggest that if they were put on trial today, their allegations of abuse would be taken more seriously \u2013 potentially leading to a very different outcome.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n lost his re-election bid, Nathan Hochman took over the his office and the Menendez case. Hochman came out forcefully against their resentencing request, and said the brothers continued to stick by a litany of \"lies\". \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" he said. But Hochman was rebuked by a judge who allowed the resentencing request to move forward. \nThe brothers have been following three paths in an effort to win their freedom. The other two are: ",

        "article_text": "After decades spent in prison by Erik and Lyle Menendez - and months of contentious court fights - a judge will hear arguments on whether the brothers should be resentenced, in a murder case that still divides America. \nThe pair are serving life in prison for killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, in 1989, when they were 21 and 18. Their case gained renewed attention after a popular Netflix series last year.\nThursday's resentencing hearing will determine whether the pair should be resentenced to a lesser penalty. If approved, the brothers could become eligible for parole - potentially allowing their freedom. \nProsecutors at the time argued Erik and Lyle meticulously planned the killings so they could access their parents' fortune. The current Los Angeles District Attorney says the brothers have continued to cling to lies about the case. \nBut the brothers' lawyers have long argued the killings were an act of self-defence and claimed their father abused them for years. They have also pointed to court filings detailing their rehabilitation during their years behind bars. \nHere is what to expect from the hearing - and a recap of how we got here.\nThe brothers shot and killed their parents with shotguns at their Beverly Hills mansion. There has long been a debate over their motive.\nProsecutors painted them during their trials as spoiled rich kids who wanted to access their parents' $14m (\u00a310.7m) fortune. They argued that the duo methodically bought shotguns and opened fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.\nThe brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered record label executive. \nThe brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.\nIt ended deadlocked, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a second trial during which the judge barred many of their claims of sexual abuse. They are imprisoned near San Diego.\nA judge will look at evidence, hear from witnesses, and ultimately determine whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced. \nIt will not be a re-trial, and guilt will not be a question. Much of the focus could instead be on what the brothers have done during their 30 years in prison. \nThe hearing - which will not be televised - will start Thursday in Los Angeles and is scheduled to also go into Friday, though it could wrap up in a single day. \nBoth sides - lawyers for the Menendez brothers and the district attorney's office - will present arguments on why the brothers should or should not be resentenced. \nThey will also be able to call people to testify. This could include a wide variety of individuals, from people involved in prosecuting the brothers in the 1990s or prison officials talking about the brothers' last 30 years behind bars. \nWe are likely to hear from members of the Menendez family, many of whom have become outspoken advocates for Erik and Lyle's release. But at least one member of the family has been a fierce critic of the effort to free them. \nMilton Anderson, who is Kitty Menendez's brother, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and has argued the pair should remain behind bars for the \"heinous act\".\nThat is unclear. If they did, it would mark a significant moment in the case, and would leave them open to questions from prosecutors who oppose their release.\nThe pair have previously appeared remotely at hearings by video link. The BBC has asked whether they will appear in person, and if they will testify. \nOn a recent episode of his podcast, lawyer Mark Geragos said he had not decided whether to call them to the stand.\n\"I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.\"\nThe district attorney's office has similarly not said who it plans to call to testify. \nAfter the two-day hearing, Los Angeles County Judge Michael Jesic will rule on whether the brothers should be resentenced. \nBut it is not clear if that will come at the conclusion of the hearing, or later.\nEven if Judge Jesic rules in favour of the brothers being resentenced, they will not be immediately released. \nWhat happens next will depend on what type of sentence the judge offers the brothers. There is a chance they could be given a new, lesser sentence that would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nBut eligibility does not guarantee release; they would still need to convince a state parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nOr the judge could opt for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe Menendez brothers filed a motion in 2023 detailing new evidence alleging childhood sexual abuse by their father, and requesting their convictions be vacated.\nThe evidence included an allegation of rape from a former member of boy band Menudo, Roy Rossell\u00f3, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse.\nThe top LA prosecutor at the time, George Gasc\u00f3n, announced that he was supporting the resentencing bid, days before an election in November 2024. He denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long time coming.\nGasc\u00f3n's announcement came shortly after a popular Netflix documentary and TV drama welcomed a new generation to the case. Many of the brothers' supporters suggest that if they were put on trial today, their allegations of abuse would be taken more seriously \u2013 potentially leading to a very different outcome.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n lost his re-election bid, Nathan Hochman took over the his office and the Menendez case. Hochman came out forcefully against their resentencing request, and said the brothers continued to stick by a litany of \"lies\". \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" he said. But Hochman was rebuked by a judge who allowed the resentencing request to move forward. \nThe brothers have been following three paths in an effort to win their freedom. The other two are: ",
