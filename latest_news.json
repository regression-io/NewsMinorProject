        "article_text": "US stock markets have tumbled over concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China will lead to a wider trade war and hurt the economy.\nThe S&P 500 index, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US, fell for a second day, ending at its lowest level since November when Trump won the election.\nThe president has followed through on a threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 20% levy on China.\nThe move drew swift retaliation, including from Canada, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Trump his decision to target the US neighbour and close trade partner was a \"very dumb thing to do\".\nTrump fired back, writing on social media: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that Trump could be ready to do a deal with Canada and Mexico. \"I think he's going to work something out with them,\" he told Fox News.\nSaying it would not be a \"pause\", he added: \"I think he's going to figure out, 'You do more and I'll meet you in the middle some way', and we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow.\"\nIt is not clear if Trump will announce a new deal but markets will be closely watching the president's address to Congress on Tuesday.\nGoods worth some $2bn cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.\nStock markets in the US and globally have fallen since Trump announced on Monday that the tariffs would go ahead.\nCanada and China have already announced retaliatory import taxes on US goods. \nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said the country would announce a response on Sunday that would include \"tariff and non-tariff measures\".\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, while the Nasdaq, where many technology companies' shares are listed, fell 0.35%. The S&P 500 closed 1.2% lower.\nAmerican retailers and carmakers were among the hardest hit, with electronics chain Best Buy's share price closing more than 13% lower.\nThe company had warned earlier on Tuesday that the tariffs would lead to higher prices for its shoppers. \n\"The giant wildcard obviously is how the consumers are going to react to the price increases in light of a lot of price increases potentially throughout the year,\" said Best Buy's chief financial officer Matt Bilunas.\nTrump said he was imposing the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in response to what he said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US.\nTrudeau called that justification \"completely bogus\" and warned that Canada's retaliatory measures would hurt. \nHe said Canada would first hit $30bn worth of products, and target the remaining $125bn over 21 days.\nAny fresh duties Canada imposes will be in place \"until the US trade action is withdrawn\", he said.\n\"Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight, not when our country and the wellbeing of every one in it is at stake,\" he said.\nAddressing Trump directly, he added: \"Donald, you're a very smart guy. But this is a very dumb thing to do.\"\nChina also swiftly announced its own counter-measures, which include 10-15% tariffs on some US agricultural goods including wheat, corn, beef and soybeans. China is the US's biggest buyer of these goods.\n\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.\nTrump said he would respond to retaliation with a plan, due in April, for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nThese would be tailor-made to each country and take into account areas such as the trade balance with the US and other taxes, such as VAT.\nTrump has also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on the EU, recently claiming that the bloc had been \"formed to screw the United States\".\nEurope has pledged to hit back, but no tariffs have been implemented yet.\nTrump is hoping that imposing tariffs on the goods that the US buys will force foreign companies to invest in America, boost tax revenues and grow the economy.\nHe has argued the tariffs - which are a tax paid by the business importing the product - will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs as foreign companies switch to production in America. \nBut tariffs also tend to trigger retaliation from targeted countries, disadvantaging domestic businesses looking to export goods, meaning the measures can ultimately hold back trade.\nAnalysts have warned that tariffs could lead to economic recessions, push up prices for US households and could also have a knock-on effect on consumers across the world, including in the UK.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said that regardless of whether the UK avoids tariffs, they will have a knock-on effect.\n\"I don't think it serves anyone well,\" she said. \"And it's absolutely the case that even if tariffs aren't applied to the UK, we will be affected by slowing global trade, by a slower [economic] growth and by higher inflation than otherwise would be the case.\"\nIf inflation rises, it could affect the pace at which interest rates are cut.\nCompanies could choose to absorb the cost of the extra tax. Chipotle said that the restaurant chain would take that route - for now.\n\"It is our intent today to hold pricing constant because we don't know if the tariffs are transitory, if they're going to be permanent, or how they will impact our business in the future,\" said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's corporate affairs chief.\nBut, like Best Buy, other US retailers warned that prices would rise. \nTarget's boss Brian Cornell said shoppers were likely to see increases over the next couple of days for foods such as avocados, bananas and strawberries.\nMexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US market each year.\nWalmart said it would try to keep prices \"as low as possible\".\n\"In the meantime, we encourage all parties to work towards finding common ground that will protect consumers from price hikes and continue to grow our economy,\" it said.\nCarmakers are also bracing for a hit.\nFord chief executive Jim Farley warned last month the business \"could handle two weeks of tariffs\".\nHe told Bloomberg: \"We could see billions of billions of dollars of pressure on the industry, lost jobs, lots of impacts to communities.\"",

And a group of particularly exercised MPs called for a debate in the House of Commons.\nThe furore was about a poem called V by northern English poet Tony Harrison \u2013 a work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds \u2013 which was originally published in January 1985, but really became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when it was screened on national television in the UK two years later, in November 1987.\nIt is not often a poem becomes a hot topic of conversation among the general public. The last time it happened was four years ago when Amanda Gorman read her poem The Hill We Climb at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, although the poet's youth and outfit excited as much comment as her verse. Before that, it was WH Auden's Funeral Blues, after it featured in the hit 1994 romcom Four Weddings and a Funeral.\u00a0\nBut if it is unusual for a poem to escape the confines of the world of literature, it's virtually unheard of for one to provoke angry newspaper headlines, and prompt politicians to demand action and members of the public to furiously call TV channels.\u00a0\nV had its origins in a visit by Harrison to Holbeck Cemetery in Beeston, Leeds, in May 1984. The cemetery stands on a hill \u2013 beneath which there are worked-out mine seams \u2013 and overlooks both Elland Road, home of Leeds United Football Club, and the University of Leeds, where Harrison, a poet and playwright, had studied Classics and Linguistics. Harrison, there to tend his parents' graves, found the cemetery strewn with beer cans and gravestones defaced by spray-painted graffiti \u2013 four-letter words, racist abuse, swastikas and a series of \"V\" letters. The nature of some of the graffiti suggested football fans were responsible.\nAt this time, unemployment was soaring, and went on to reach 11.9% later that year, a level not seen in the UK since 1971 \u2013 and not seen since. The previous year, an award-winning BBC drama, The Boys from the Blackstuff, about unemployed tarmac-layers in Liverpool, had captured the zeitgeist and made a huge impact. The Miners' Strike had started some weeks earlier. In fact, the country was deeply divided under a polarising Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher. In the vandalism and the spray-painted daubings, Harrison saw further evidence of societal division, and it gave him the idea for his poem.\nHarrison was, at this point, an established and well-respected poet, playwright and translator. He had published several volumes of verse and been the resident dramatist at the National Theatre, while his 1973 translation of Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope had won great acclaim.\nOn 24 January 1985, V was published in the London Review of Books.\nIt consists of 112 four-line stanzas, or quatrains, with an ABAB rhyming scheme, the same form as Thomas Gray's celebrated 18th-Century poem Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, which Harrison sought to evoke in contrast with his own work.\nThe \"V\" of the title stands for \"versus\" \u2013 which is also a pun on \"verses\" \u2013 but maybe also for \"victory\", and perhaps it is further intended to refer to the two-fingered \"V sign\" gesture considered rude in British culture.\nOne verse reads:\nThese Vs are all the versuses of life\nfrom LEEDS v. DERBY, Black/White\nand (as I've known to my cost) man v. wife, \nCommunist v. Fascist, Left v. Right.\nThe poem imagines the poet engaging in a dialogue with the person who has defaced the graves, and it features the obscenities and racist epithets used in the graffiti.\n\"We didn't need Harrison to tell us then that Britain was divided, and we don't now, but\u00a0V was a powerful articulation of those divisions and some of their causes,\" says Sandie Byrne, Professor of English at the University of Oxford.\u00a0\n\"The football supporter who, taking a shortcut through the cemetery, takes out his rage on the gravestones, is treated sympathetically, albeit with aggressive language to match his own. The Harrison figure understands the frustration of the third-generation unemployed among headstones celebrating lifelong professions.\n\"The poem's power and endurance come from its energy, the impetus of the verse and the language, its anger, and its use of the personal in the service of the political.\"\nV did not appear to cause any outrage when first printed in the London Review of Books. It was subsequently published in book form by Bloodaxe Books in November 1985 and, again, troubled neither the UK's legislature nor its newspapers.\u00a0Neil\u00a0Astley, founder of Bloodaxe Books, and still the publisher's editor and managing director, recalls that, soon after the publication of the poem as a book, \u00a0Harrison performed the entire thing in a late-night arts slot on Tyne Tees Television, which catered specifically to audiences in North East England, and \"it went out without arousing any opposition as far as I'm aware\".\nBut then in 1987, it became known that a televised version of the poem had been made for national broadcaster Channel 4, directed by celebrated theatre director Richard Eyre and featuring Harrison reading the poem along with footage of, among other things, striking miners, Holbeck Cemetery and Thatcher doing a \"victory\" sign. At that point, all hell broke loose.\nIn October, a few weeks before its broadcast, the Daily Mail reported on the \"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" on its front page. The activist and anti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse called the poem a \"work of singular nastiness\". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, who earlier that year had attempted to introduce legislation that would make it a crime to air material that might cause \"gross offence\" to a \"reasonable person\", was another who opposed its broadcast. He officially called for a debate in the House of Commons to try to stop it. One hundred and twenty one MPs signed the proposal. Howarth later admitted he had not read the poem in full. Harrison recalled in the 2013 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Exploring V, that at the height of the furore, a reporter from the Telegraph knocked on his door. \"I said, 'Have you read the poem?'\u2019 He said,'No. I'm New'.\"\nOpposition to the TV programme came principally from right wing commentators but the Sunday Telegraph columnist and editor of the Literary Review, Auberon Waugh, whom no-one had ever mistaken for a left winger, found the poem \"well written and extremely moving\", as he wrote in his Telegraph column at the time. Ian Hislop, the editor of UK satirical magazine Private Eye, wrote an article defending it in The Listener, as did Bernard Levin in the Times, calling it \"powerful, profound and haunting\". And the Independent printed the whole poem in its news pages, with an introduction by Blake Morrison in which he wrote: \"Those MPs are right to believe that the poem is shocking but not because of its language. It shocks because it describes unflinchingly what is meant by a divided society, because it takes the abstractions we have learned to live with \u2013 unemployment, racial tension, inequality, deprivation \u2013\u00a0and gives them a kind of physical existence on the page.\"\nThe film was broadcast at 11pm on Channel 4 on Wednesday 4 November 1987. According to the logs of the Channel 4 staff on the switchboard \u2013 which were reproduced in the appendix of Bloodaxe's second edition of the poem, along with many of the newspaper and magazine articles about the furore \u2013 there were several calls from viewers irate at the \"disgusting language\". But others approved. Mr K of Watford suggested \"politicians should address their energies into the social problems featured in the poem\". Mr W of London said: \"I am so moved the tears are running down my cheeks\". The majority of calls were in favour of the broadcast.\n\"The irony is, of course, that while Bloodaxe had sold a couple of thousand copies of the poem before 1987, as a result of the attacks on the Channel 4 film, V reached an audience of millions who might otherwise never have heard of it,\" Astley tells the BBC. \"And if you read the poem today, it feels every bit as vital and relevant as it was 40 years ago.\"\nSandie Byrne says: \"I remember friends reading about the poem in the press, and assuming that it was just a meretricious piece studded with swear words by a shock jock seeking attention. Others picked up that it mentioned [miners' leader] Arthur Scargill, and showed scenes of the miners' strike, and assumed that those were its only subjects. Even among those who actually read it, the poem seemed to revive ideas about appropriateness in poetic diction that one would have thought long dead.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 'obscene' book that became a bestseller\n\u2022 Why did Jane Austen's sister burn her letters?\n\u2022 40 of the most exciting books to read in 2025\n\"What was unexpected and possibly shocking about\u00a0V,\" Byrne tells the BBC, \"was less the dialogue that represented a young football supporter swearing \u2013 what a surprise \u2013 and more the use of iambic pentameter quatrains, at a time when closely patterned, regular verse was regarded as outmoded, an unfitting vehicle for modern concerns. The transplantation of Gray's elegy from a small country churchyard to a large urban cemetery, the use of ellipses, slang, ordinary speech and Northern pronunciation perhaps suggested that poetry wasn't a sleepy dusty backwater, or necessarily couched in prissy, posh Southern or elaborate language.\"\nThe poem was once again broadcast in its entirety on Radio 4 in 2013. Although the press anticipated controversy, there was actually little fuss. Perhaps listeners had become more used to four-letter words being used in all sorts of media. The racist epithets would have if anything, been considered even more offensive in 2013 than when the Channel 4 film was broadcast. The half-hour Radio 4 documentary that was aired before the reading of the poem that contextualised the swear words and slurs must have helped listeners understand their use in the work.\nBoth poet and poem are now an accepted part of the literary canon. The website of the Poetry Foundation, a well-respected US organisation set up to promote poetry, describes Harrison as \"Britain's leading poet-playwright\", and says that V remains his \"most famous poem\". But while V's power to shock may have been somewhat diminished, it has lost none of its ability to engage and move the reader.\nThe full text of Tony Harrison\u2019s V can be read on the London Review of Books website.

        "article_text": "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.\nAll the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.\nThe test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.\nSuch metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.\n\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.\nThe firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.\nThe robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.\nSuch a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.\n\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.\nDeep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"\nScars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.\nIn 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.\nOpposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.\nNautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.\nMinerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.\nCurrently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.\nNo commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.\nMr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.\nHe adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.\nUnlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.\nHe also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"\nJovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.\nSome deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.\n\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"\nThe Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.\nMr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".\nThose calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.\n\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.\nThe Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.\nDutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.\nThe Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.\nClaims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.\nJeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.\nSome sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.\nMr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.\nAnn Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.\nDr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.\nAnd there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.\n\"When you delve deeper into it, and you look at which minerals actually have supply shortages, I'm not sure that adds up,\" she says.",

        "article_text": "China has set an economic growth target for this year of \"around 5%\" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.\nIts leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.\nBut the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most.\nPresident Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.\nThis follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports. \nBeijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans.\nAt the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the \"main engine and anchor\" of its economic growth.\nBeijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus. \nRepeating that is going to be much harder this year. \n\"If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics. \nBeijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges. \nOn Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to \"vigorously boost\" household demand.\n\"Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough.\"\n\"Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,\" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world.\nBeijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices. \nThe government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment.\nBeijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; \u00a3140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual \"Work Report\". \nIn a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades.\nThe hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline. \nIt also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year.\nThe government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population.\nWhether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question.\nHarsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.   \nBut China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was \"important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant\".\nInvestment in what President Xi calls \"high-quality development\", which covers high-tech industries from renewables to artificial intelligence (AI), is also expected to be a major focus.\nThe world's second-largest economy, China has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West.\nState media has already touted recent examples like DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics, both of which have caught global attention, as examples of China's \"technological progress\". \nThe success of DeepSeek in particular saw an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors. \nA commentary in the state-run Xinhua newspaper said \"China's new energy industries and overall green transition, driven by its cutting-edge technologies, will continue to be important growth drivers\". \nBut the new US levies - which come on top of tariffs from Trump's first term - could  stymie these plans, not least because they could dampen investor sentiment.\n\"The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment,\" Mr Murphy Cruise says. \"Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment.\"\nAlso on Wednesday, China announced a 7.2% increase in its national defence budget, the same rate of growth as last year.\nAdditional reporting by Jo\u00e3o da Silva",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has imposed\u00a0his long-threatened 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods, as well as a new 10% levy against China, citing the countries' failure to stop the export of chemicals used in the production of the powerful opioid fentanyl.\nThe US has long accused Chinese corporations of knowingly supplying groups involved in the creation of the drug. Beijing has hit back with tariffs of its own.\nThe White House has also accused Canada and Mexico of failing to prevent criminal gangs from smuggling fentanyl into the US.\nBeijing has hit back with a 15% tariff of its own, and Canada has announced 25% tariffs against $30bn worth of US goods, with an additional $125bn worth of products to be hit over the next 21 days. \nMexico is expected to respond later on Tuesday.\nFentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals. US regulators approved it for use in medical settings as a pain reliever in the 1960s, but it has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.\nOver 74,000 Americans died in 2023 after taking drug mixtures containing fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nIt is frequently mixed with other illicit drugs, leading many users to be unaware that the substances they are consuming contain fentanyl.\nAs little as a two milligram dose of fentanyl - roughly the size of a pencil tip - can be fatal.\nOver the past decade, the global fentanyl supply chain has expanded, making it harder for law enforcement and policymakers to control.\nChina is the primary source of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl.\nSince September, 7,793 lb (3,534kg) of fentanyl have been seized in the US, according to figures published by US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).\nAlmost all (98%) was intercepted at the southwest border with Mexico. Less than 1% was seized across the northern US border with Canada. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.\nAccording to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Mexican criminal organisations - including the Sinaloa Cartel - play a key role in producing and delivering fentanyl, methamphetamine and other illicit drugs into the US.\nThe chemicals used to make fentanyl are sourced from China by traffickers and turned into the finished product in labs in Mexico before being smuggled into the US.\nAccording to the DEA, the Sinaloa Cartel uses a variety of tactics to conceal shipments coming into Mexico, such as hiding the chemicals among legitimate commercial goods, mislabelling the containers, using front companies, and shipping through third party countries.\nThe Trump administration has accused the Mexican government of colluding with the drug cartels.

US regulators approved it for use in medical settings as a pain reliever in the 1960s, but it has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.Over 74,000 Americans died in 2023 after taking drug mixtures containing fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).It is frequently mixed with other illicit drugs, leading many users to be unaware that the substances they are consuming contain fentanyl.As little as a two milligram dose of fentanyl - roughly the size of a pencil tip - can be fatal.Over the past decade, the global fentanyl supply chain has expanded, making it harder for law enforcement and policymakers to control.China is the primary source of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl.Most fentanyl enters the US via MexicoSince September, 7,793 lb (3,534kg) of fentanyl have been seized in the US, according to figures published by US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).Almost all (98%) was intercepted at the southwest border with Mexico. In the first 10 months of 2024, the Canadian border service reported seizing 10.8lb (4.9kg) of fentanyl entering from the US, while US Border Patrol intercepted 32.1lb (14.6kg) of fentanyl coming from Canada.In December, the country pledged C$1.3bn ($900m; \u00a3700m) for combating fentanyl and enhancing border security.And on February 11th, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the appointment\u00a0 Kevin Brosseau, as Canada's fentanyl czar. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.According to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Mexican criminal organisations - including the Sinaloa Cartel - play a key role in producing and delivering fentanyl, methamphetamine and other illicit drugs into the US.The chemicals used to make fentanyl are sourced from China by traffickers and turned into the finished product in labs in Mexico before being smuggled into the US.According to the DEA, the Sinaloa Cartel uses a variety of tactics to conceal shipments coming into Mexico, such as hiding the chemicals among legitimate commercial goods, mislabelling the containers, using front companies, and shipping through third party countries.The Trump administration has accused the Mexican government of colluding with the drug cartels.",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada, calling it a \"very dumb thing to do\" and vowed to conduct a \"relentless fight\" to protect its economy.\nTrump has imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.\nThe Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.\nBut Trump pushed even further in a post on Truth Social, saying: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nTrudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". \n\"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\"This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\"\nHe said that Canada's main goal remains to get the tariffs lifted so that they \"don't last a second longer than necessary\".\nTrump said he is protecting US jobs and manufacturing, and trying to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US president said his goal is to clamp down on the powerful opioid fentanyl; he has variously blamed the other countries for the drug's arrival in the US.\nResponding to the accusations, Trudeau said on Tuesday there was \"no justification\" for the new tariffs, because less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the US border comes from Canada. \nTrudeau's words were echoed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said there was \"no motive, no reason, no justification\" for Trump's move. Speaking on Tuesday, she too vowed to issue her own \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" - but said further details would be given on Sunday.\nTrump's tariffs are likely to push up prices for consumers in the US and abroad, said John Rogers, an economics professor at American International University.\nThe items most likely to be affected the soonest are food - the fruits, vegetables and other produce the US imports from Mexico - followed by the large amounts of oil and gas imported from Canada, Prof Rogers said.\n\"Prices could go up pretty soon\", Prof Rogers warned, though he was reluctant to say by exactly how much or how quickly. \n\"We are in pretty uncharted territory,\" he told the BBC.\nThe bigger concern for prof Rogers was the potential damage he said was being done to America's longstanding trade partners.\n\"This is kind of sticking your finger in the eye of your neighbour,\" he said, adding that, in a potential US-Canada-Mexico trade war, \"everybody is a loser\".\nThe three countries targeted are America's top trading partners, and the tit-for-tat measures also prompted fears of that very trade war. \n\"There's no way you can win a trade war. Everybody suffers, because everybody's just going to wind up paying higher prices and sacrificing quality,\" Prof Rogers said. \nTariffs are a tax on imports from other countries, designed to protect against cheaper competition from elsewhere, and boost businesses and jobs at home.\nCanada's retaliatory measures include a 25% reciprocal tariff that will be imposed on C$155bn (US$107bn; \u00a384bn) of American goods:\nCanada's Immigration Minister Marc Miller warned that as many as a million jobs in Canada were at risk if the tariffs were implemented, given how intertwined trade was between the two countries.\n\"We can't replace an economy that is responsible for 80% of our trade overnight and it's going to hurt,\" he said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency, a car manufacturing employee in the Canadian province of Ontario said people were indeed \"pretty scared\" of being laid off. \"I just bought my first house,\" Joel Soleski said. \"I might have to look for work elsewhere.\"\nThe sector is one that could be badly affected by the new tariffs regime in North America. Car parts may cross US-Canada border several times during the manufacturing process, and so might be taxed on multiple occasions.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto manufacturing industry, told reporters on Tuesday that he anticipates assembly plants will \"shut down on both sides of the border\" as a result of the tariffs.\nThe tariffs were called \"reckless\" by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whose president Candace Laing cautioned that the move would force both Canada and the US towards \"recession, job losses and economic disaster\".\nMs Laing warned they would also increase prices for Americans, and force US businesses to find alternate suppliers that she said \"are less reliable than Canadian ones\".\nCanadian provincial leaders have vowed their own responses. \nFord of Ontario mooted the possibility of cutting off Canadian electricity supplies and exports of high-grade nickel to the US, as well as putting an export levy of 25% on electricity sent to power homes in Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nCanada exports enough electricity to power some six million American homes.\nOntario and other provinces have also moved to remove US-made liquor off their shelves. In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said his province will ban American companies from bidding on provincial contracts, as will Ontario. \nFord also announced that a C$100m ($68m; \u00a355.1) contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet company Starlink will be cancelled.\nMeanwhile China - which now faces tariffs of 20% after Trump doubled an earlier levy - has vowed to fight any trade war to the \"bitter end\". It has announced its own counter-measures - including tariffs on a range of US agricultural and food products.",

        "article_text": "It is often said that marriages are made in heaven.\nBut in India, where a majority of marriages are arranged, the process of match-making can feel like a passage through hell for a woman and her family.\nThat's the premise of Sthal: A Match, the 2023 gritty Marathi-language film that has won several prestigious awards at festivals in India and abroad. It is releasing for the first time in theatres in India on Friday.\nSet in rural Maharashtra state, the film centres around Savita, a young woman striving for an education and a career in a patriarchal society, and the attempts by her father Daulatrao Wandhare - a poor cotton farmer - to find a good husband for his daughter.\n\"He wants a good price for his crop and a good match for his daughter,\" says director Jayant Digambar Somalkar.\nThe film is notable for the unflinching way it portrays what its lead actress calls the \"very humiliating\" experience of many young women, unlike other Indian movies about arranged marriage.\nSthal has also grabbed attention as its entire cast is made up of first-time actors chosen from the village where it is shot. Nandini Chikte, who plays Savita, has already won two awards for her brilliant performance.\nThe film opens with a sequence where Savita is interviewing a prospective groom.\nAlong with her female relatives and friends, she watches as the young man serves them drinks from a tray. They laugh when he, visibly nervous, fumbles during questioning.\nRudely awakened from what turned out to be a dream, Savita is told to get ready as a group of men are coming to see her.\nIn reality, the gender roles are completely reversed, and in a scene that's replayed several times in the nearly two-hour film, Savita's humiliation comes into sharp focus.\nThe prospective groom and other men from his family are welcomed by Savita's father and male relatives. Guests are fed tea and snacks and once the introductions are done, Savita is called in.\nDressed in a sari, with eyes downcast, she sits down on a wooden stool facing her interrogators.\nQuestions come, thick and fast. What's your name? Full name? Mother's clan? Date of birth? Height? Education? Subject? Hobbies? Are you willing to work on the farm? \nThe men step out, to hold a discussion. \"She's a bit dark. She had makeup on her face, but did you not see her elbow? That is her real colour,\" says one. \"She's also short,\" he goes on to add. Others nod in agreement.\nThey leave, telling Daulatrao that they will respond in a few days to let him know their decision.\nAccording to her parents, \"this is the fourth or fifth time someone has come to see Savita\" - all the earlier meetings have ended in rejection, leading to heartbreak and despair.\nThe scene rings true. In India, men often have a laundry list of attributes they want in their brides - a glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers and match-making websites shows everyone wants tall, fair, beautiful brides.\nSavita's protestations - \"I don't want to get married, I first want to finish college and then take civil services exams and build a career\" - carry no weight in her rural community, where marriage is presented as the only goal worth having for a young woman.\n\"Marriage is given far too much importance in our society,\" Chikte told the BBC. \"Parents believe that once the daughter is married, they will become free of their responsibility. It's time to change that narrative.\" \nShe says she found it \"very humiliating\" that Savita was made to sit on a stool to be judged by all those men who discussed her skin colour, while there was no discussion about the prospective groom.\n\"I was only acting, but as the film progressed, I lived Savita's journey and I felt angry on her behalf. I felt insulted and disrespected.\" \nThe film also tackles the social evil that is dowry - the practice of the bride's family gifting cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family. \nThough it has been illegal for more than 60 years, dowries are still omnipresent in Indian weddings.\nParents of girls are known to take out huge loans or even sell their land and house to meet dowry demands. Even that doesn't necessarily ensure a happy life for a bride as tens of thousands are killed every year by the groom or his family for bringing in insufficient dowries. \nIn the film too, Daulatrao puts up a \"for sale\" sign on his land, even though farming is his only source of livelihood.\nDirector Somalkar says the idea for his debut feature film is rooted in his own experience.\nGrowing up with two sisters and five female cousins, he had witnessed the ritual far too many times when prospective grooms visited his home.\n\"As a child you don't question tradition,\" he says, adding that the turning point came in 2016 when he accompanied a male cousin to see a prospective bride.\n\"This was the first time I was on the other side. I felt a bit uncomfortable when the woman came out and sat on a stool and was asked questions. When we stepped out for a discussion, I felt the conversation about her height and skin colour was objectifying her.\"\nWhen he discussed the issue with his fianc\u00e9e at the time - who is now his wife - she encouraged him to explore it in his work.\nIn a country where 90% of all marriages are still arranged by families, Sthal is not the first to tackle the subject on screen. IMDB has a list of nearly 30 films about arranged marriage made by Bollywood and regional film industries just in the past two decades. \nMore recently, the wildly popular Netflix show Indian Matchmaking focused entirely on the process of finding the perfect partner.\nBut, as Somalkar points out, \"weddings are hugely glamourised\" on screen. \n\"When we think of weddings in India, we think of the big fat wedding full of fun and glamour. We think of Hum Aapke Hain Koun,\" he says, referring to the 1990s Bollywood blockbuster that celebrates Indian wedding traditions. \n\"And the Netflix show only dealt with a certain class of people, the ones who are wealthy and educated and the women are able to exercise their choice. \n\"But the reality for a majority of Indians is very different and parents often have to go through hell to get their daughters married,\" he adds.\nHis reason for making Sthal, he says, is to \"jolt society and audiences out of complacency. \n\"I want to start a debate and encourage people to think about a process that objectifies women who have very little freedom to choose between marriage and career,\" he says. \n\"I know one book or one film doesn't change society overnight, but it can be a start.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

His resentencing was possible under a law that allows for sentence reductions for people convicted as minors and have spent more than 20 years in prison. \nBaltimore City Circuit Judge Jennifer Schiffer made the ruling in court on Tuesday. \nSyed and Min Lee were classmates in high school in Maryland when Lee disappeared in January 1999. Her body was found in a forest three weeks later.\nSyed, then 17, was found guilty of first degree murder in February 2000, and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors at the time alleged Syed carried out the crime after becoming jealous of Lee's new relationship after the two broke up.\nIn 2014, Syed's case gained national attention through the true-crime podcast 'Serial', which was listened to by millions of people. \nThe podcast raised questions about the evidence provided by prosecutors and witnesses that appeared at his trial, and it explored the effectiveness of Syed's attorney.\nFans of the podcast have donated more than $80,000 to Syed's legal fund, according to CBS News.\nSyed was cleared of all charges in 2022 after prosecutors said he had been wrongfully convicted.\nBut his conviction was reinstated a year later in 2023 after an appeals court found that the lower court had failed to give the victim's brother sufficient notice of the hearing that freed Syed.\nJudge Schiffer's ruling on Tuesday allows for Syed to remain free.

But when it comes to ticket prices, there is unity.\n\"We are all fighting the same fight on ticket prices,\" said Manchester United Supporters' Trust CEO Duncan Drasdo.\n\"Clubs are exploiting loyalty and fans are united in saying enough is enough.\"\nWhen 19 of the Premier League's 20 clubs raised their ticket prices before the 2024-25 season, the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) launched a campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty'.\nThose protests have grown again this season, with some clubs removing concessionary discounts for the elderly and young people - and teams like Arsenal announcing increases for 2025-26.\nThe cost of competing for trophies, increasing operational expenses, and the threat of complying with financial regulations, have all been given as reasons for price hikes.\nBBC Sport has analysed a new Uefa report showing the league's financial power and how much clubs make from tickets - but also the challenge of increased staffing levels and expensive running costs.\nPremier League clubs made a total of almost 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) from selling tickets to home matches in 2023, Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report shows.\nThat figure is growing by about 10% per year, and is almost double that of Spain's  La Liga (\u00a3481m) and Germany's Bundesliga (\u00a3430m).\nThe report uses a mixture of full financial reporting of more than 700 clubs for 2023, plus 2024 figures from 130 of Europe's biggest clubs.\nOf the 10 clubs who generated the most income from gate receipts in 2024, six are English.\nThe same six Premier League clubs feature in the top 12 for another ticketing metric, which measures the money earned per fan, per ticket.\n\"What the figures show is that English top-flight clubs are doing very well financially in a whole number of different metrics,\" says Tom Greatrex, chair of the FSA.\n\"Healthy ticket revenue shows people are wanting to go - but also shows the ratcheting up of ticket prices in the past few years. That is manifesting itself in the protests and disenchantment we've seen.\"\nThe report also points out that \"stadium expansions and/or increases in premium seating and hospitality have also doubled gate revenues at Paris St-Germain, Bayern [Munich], Liverpool and Manchester City since 2009\".\nArsenal and Tottenham's positions are helped by sales of high-value hospitality seats at modern stadiums in London - one of the world's most-visited cities.\n\"What we have seen clubs do through stadium expansion is a huge focus on those seats being hospitality,\" says Dan Plumley, senior lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University. \n\"On a basic financial level it makes sense, because you can generate more from that than a baseline seat. \n\"But if that is stopping your more average fan getting a ticket, that is something clubs are going to have to grapple with.\"\nThe report states the average amount made per fan from tickets is \u00a329-\u00a337 \"for the majority of clubs\".\nFans from four rival clubs to protest at ticket prices\nMan Utd fans criticise ticket prices - as club reveals manager change costs\nPremier League ticket price rises - what the fans think\nThe Uefa report paints a similar picture to other research such as the annual Deloitte Money League - with Premier League clubs bringing in far more revenue  (\u00a36.2bn in 2023) than other European leagues.\nHowever, English clubs reported a combined loss of \u00a3728m before tax.\nTV rights deals are showing signs of plateauing, so clubs need to maximise matchday income and commercial and sponsorship revenues to try to offset significant spending on transfers, wages and running costs in order to turn a profit.\nThe report outlines some eye-watering spending figures:\nPremier League clubs spent \u00a34bn on player wages in 2023, almost double second-placed Spain (\u00a32.1bn).\nFour European clubs have squads that cost more than 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) to assemble by the end of 2024, and all are English - Chelsea (1.7bn euros/\u00a31.4bn), Manchester City (1.3bn euros/\u00a31.1bn), Manchester United (1.1bn euros/\u00a3920m), and Arsenal (1bn euros/\u00a3840m).\nChelsea's 2024 squad was found to be \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record - the 2020 Real Madrid squad. The report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nFour of the five most profitable clubs - by pre-tax profits - in 2024 were German: Bayern (\u00a353m), Borussia Dortmund (\u00a341m), Lazio (\u00a334m), Leipzig (\u00a331m), Eintracht Frankfurt (\u00a327m).\nThree of the five least profitable clubs in 2024 - by pre-tax losses - were English: Juventus (\u00a3164m), Chelsea (\u00a393m), Aston Villa (\u00a384m), Roma (\u00a363m), Liverpool (\u00a355m).\nPlumley says: \"Each individual club will have its own reasons for doing it, but raising ticket prices doesn't shift the dial massively in terms of the overall picture of the finances.\n\"I get that costs have gone up, we understand that side of the equation, but this is where it really grinds with fans.\"\nFans of some clubs have been contesting the loss of concessionary tickets for the elderly, juniors, and disabled supporters\nManchester United's controversial plans to make up to 450 redundancies,, external cut about 39% of its workforce and \"return the club to profitability\" have put a sharper focus on how many people are actually needed to run a football club - and the operating costs involved.\nWhile transfer spending remains a club's biggest outgoing, the report says high inflation in areas such as utilities, plus the wages spent on more employees to expand commercial activity, is biting. \nOperating costs have risen by 12% across Europe, with a total of \u00a31.5bn spent in the Premier League in 2023, almost \u00a3500m higher than second-placed Germany\nOperating costs plus non-player wages absorb just under half the revenue of big-five European league clubs\nIn 2024, six Premier League teams featured in the top 10 for money spent on operating costs.\n\"Operations costs have increased - that's fair,\" Greatrex says. \"But increasing ticket prices way beyond the level of inflation, year after year, which is what has started to happen with most clubs in the Premier League - and then trying to claim that PSR or financial fair play are the reason - is the clubs treating people as though they're idiots.\"\nSalaries paid to non-footballer staff members have also risen sharply.\nThe average top 20 club in Europe has 970 full-time employees - Barcelona have the most with 1,781\nFour Premier League teams have more than 1,000 full-time employees - Man Utd, Brighton, Liverpool and Man City\nPremier League clubs employed a total of 11,081 full-time employees by the end of 2023\nEnglish top-flight clubs paid a total of \u00a31bn in non-player wages in 2023. That total, which includes wages paid to staff members such as coaches, media departments and ticket office personnel, is more than twice that of second-placed Germany\nThere was 19% inflation on non-player wages across Europe in 2023 and for the biggest clubs, head coach wages rose on average 21% in 2024\nThat compares to a more modest average growth of 4.5% in player wages in 2024, which the report said was \"essential for financial stability as clubs struggle with strong inflation\".\nThe logic behind the rise in staffing numbers varies per club. Brighton, for example, employ a notoriously vast recruitment and scouting operation.\nThe report states that employee growth can be explained by clubs' desire to wring more from commercial and sponsorship deals.\nAcross Europe, income from commercial and sponsorship deals has risen by 39% since 2019.\n\"Commercial income is almost untapped in terms of potential and there is no restriction on the number of deals you can sign,\" Plumley says. \n\"But you have to throw more resource at that.\n\"There are more roles now in football clubs than ever before. Some of them are quite forward thinking.\n\"It's a natural consequence of how the game has evolved, because everyone is pushing for growth, growth, growth.\"",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada, calling it a \"very dumb thing to do\" and vowed to conduct a \"relentless fight\" to protect its economy.\nTrump has imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.\nThe Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.\nBut Trump pushed even further in a post on Truth Social, saying: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nTrudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". \n\"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\"This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\"\nHe said that Canada's main goal remains to get the tariffs lifted so that they \"don't last a second longer than necessary\".\nTrump said he is protecting US jobs and manufacturing, and trying to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US president said his goal is to clamp down on the powerful opioid fentanyl; he has variously blamed the other countries for the drug's arrival in the US.\nResponding to the accusations, Trudeau said on Tuesday there was \"no justification\" for the new tariffs, because less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the US border comes from Canada. \nTrudeau's words were echoed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said there was \"no motive, no reason, no justification\" for Trump's move. Speaking on Tuesday, she too vowed to issue her own \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" - but said further details would be given on Sunday.\nTrump's tariffs are likely to push up prices for consumers in the US and abroad, said John Rogers, an economics professor at American International University.\nThe items most likely to be affected the soonest are food - the fruits, vegetables and other produce the US imports from Mexico - followed by the large amounts of oil and gas imported from Canada, Prof Rogers said.\n\"Prices could go up pretty soon\", Prof Rogers warned, though he was reluctant to say by exactly how much or how quickly. \n\"We are in pretty uncharted territory,\" he told the BBC.\nThe bigger concern for prof Rogers was the potential damage he said was being done to America's longstanding trade partners.\n\"This is kind of sticking your finger in the eye of your neighbour,\" he said, adding that, in a potential US-Canada-Mexico trade war, \"everybody is a loser\".\nThe three countries targeted are America's top trading partners, and the tit-for-tat measures also prompted fears of that very trade war. \n\"There's no way you can win a trade war. Everybody suffers, because everybody's just going to wind up paying higher prices and sacrificing quality,\" Prof Rogers said. \nTariffs are a tax on imports from other countries, designed to protect against cheaper competition from elsewhere, and boost businesses and jobs at home.\nCanada's retaliatory measures include a 25% reciprocal tariff that will be imposed on C$155bn (US$107bn; \u00a384bn) of American goods:\nCanada's Immigration Minister Marc Miller warned that as many as a million jobs in Canada were at risk if the tariffs were implemented, given how intertwined trade was between the two countries.\n\"We can't replace an economy that is responsible for 80% of our trade overnight and it's going to hurt,\" he said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency, a car manufacturing employee in the Canadian province of Ontario said people were indeed \"pretty scared\" of being laid off. \"I just bought my first house,\" Joel Soleski said. \"I might have to look for work elsewhere.\"\nThe sector is one that could be badly affected by the new tariffs regime in North America. Car parts may cross US-Canada border several times during the manufacturing process, and so might be taxed on multiple occasions.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto manufacturing industry, told reporters on Tuesday that he anticipates assembly plants will \"shut down on both sides of the border\" as a result of the tariffs.\nThe tariffs were called \"reckless\" by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whose president Candace Laing cautioned that the move would force both Canada and the US towards \"recession, job losses and economic disaster\".\nMs Laing warned they would also increase prices for Americans, and force US businesses to find alternate suppliers that she said \"are less reliable than Canadian ones\".\nCanadian provincial leaders have vowed their own responses. \nFord of Ontario mooted the possibility of cutting off Canadian electricity supplies and exports of high-grade nickel to the US, as well as putting an export levy of 25% on electricity sent to power homes in Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nCanada exports enough electricity to power some six million American homes.\nOntario and other provinces have also moved to remove US-made liquor off their shelves. In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said his province will ban American companies from bidding on provincial contracts, as will Ontario. \nFord also announced that a C$100m ($68m; \u00a355.1) contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet company Starlink will be cancelled.\nMeanwhile China - which now faces tariffs of 20% after Trump doubled an earlier levy - has vowed to fight any trade war to the \"bitter end\". It has announced its own counter-measures - including tariffs on a range of US agricultural and food products.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nNo-one can predict the score - Arteta\nEindhoven has been packed with carnival-goers in recent days but on Tuesday it was Arsenal enjoying their own party in the city, getting over their goalscoring crisis and setting a Champions League record in the process.\nMikel Arteta's side became the first team in Champions League history to score seven goals away from home in the knockout stages of the competition as they romped to a 7-1 win over PSV Eindhoven.\nIt was the most goals the Gunners have scored in a single game since beating Newcastle 7-3 in the Premier League 13 years ago.\nThe Arsenal manager said the win had given his players \"joy and confidence and belief\", but was not getting carried away when questions were put to him about the records that his team had broken.\n\"For sure, it's something that hasn't been done, so great to be part of that,\" Arteta said. \"But as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that.\n\"The happiest thing is we are in a very strong position to go to the next round, which is where we want to be.\n\"But there's still a job to do in London in a week's time.\"\nAfter failing to score in their past two games, a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest and 1-0 defeat by West Ham, Arteta may not have seen a victory like this coming. \n\"This will give them great confidence for the rest of the season. Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDevastating Arsenal can win Champions League - Sutton\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too. He took it well  and we're all there to support and I'm sure he will learn from that too.\"\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

I completely agree with you on that,\" Newsom told conservative figure Charlie Kirk. \"It is an issue of fairness, it's deeply unfair. We've got to own that. We've got to acknowledge it.\" \nNewsom's change of tone comes amid a debate within his party over the extent to which cultural factors played a role in their resounding defeat in November, when Republicans won the White House and both chambers of Congress.\nA number of Democrats quickly denounced the governor's comments. \n\"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,\" a statement from California's LGBT legislative caucus read.  \nOn the debut episode of the governor's podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, his first guest was a pro-Trump activist whose Turning Point USA organisation advocates for conservative ideas on liberal-leaning college campuses. \nThe two discussed why Democratic nominee Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump, and Newsom said his party was being politically \"crushed\" on transgender issues.\nThe governor referred to a viral Trump campaign ad that had the tagline: \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\"It was devastating,\" Newsom said. \"And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating.\"\nKirk argued that Democrats were out of touch with everyday Americans because of broad support within the party for transgender athletes competing in sports, which he said was unfair. \n\"I revere sports,\" said Newsom. \"So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.\"\nThe governor added: \"The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well.\"\nFormer Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called Newsom's remarks about trans athletes \"disgusting\".\nPramila Jayapal, a left-wing Democrat representing a district in the north-western state of Washington, told Politico that her party should not \"take the bait and give into their anti-trans people rhetoric\". \nBut one moderate Democratic lawmaker agreed. \nSeth Moulton, of Massachusetts, told Politico that Newsom was correct and polling shows it. \n\"More and more are willing to say what they've probably always thought - and that's a good thing,\" he said. \nAccording to an opinion survey in January by the New York Times/Ipsos, almost all Republicans and nearly seven in 10 Democrats oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women's sports.\nThroughout his career, Newsom has positioned himself to the left of his party on LGBT rights.\nHe made headlines in 2004 as San Francisco mayor when he ordered the city clerk to issue same-sex marriage licences, which at the time wasn't allowed under state or federal law. \nNewsom made the state the first sanctuary for transgender youth and protected school curriculums that included LGBT history.\nLast year he signed legislation that made California the first state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify parents if their child changed gender identity.",

        "article_text": "Jade Jones was appointed an MBE in 2013 and an OBE in 2020\nWales' double Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones is switching sports and has taken up boxing.\nThe 31-year-old says she is \"dreaming big\" as she intends to become a two-sport world champion.\nJones has been boxing for two months and is training with former professional boxer Stephen Smith in a move she believes is unprecedented as she eyes a career in the paid ranks.\n\"It is nerve-wracking. Some days I wake up and think 'am I absolutely crazy?'\" Jones told BBC Breakfast.\n\"I am loving it. I love taekwondo, it will always be my first love. But this is an exciting challenge.\"\nJones was born in Bodelwyddan in Denbighshire\nJones' switch is sure to raise eyebrows, having competed for two decades in a sport where kicking your opponent is the name of the game and she admits her decision did come out of the blue.\n\"I don't know what gave me the idea, I was sat in my kitchen and thought 'I'll try boxing', my family all think I'm crazy, but people who know me know it is inside me, I love to have a fight and a scrap,\" she said.\n\"People can follow my journey, the good, the bad and the ugly. Can I get to the top? Will I fail?\n\"The dream is to be a world champion. To be a world champion in two sports would be pretty cool.\"\nBolt to Rees-Zammit - a dozen career switching stars\nJones admits she has faced a huge culture shock as she has learned about the \"sweet science\" of boxing.\n\"Boxing is arguably the hardest sport in the world, but I am up for the challenge, I want to give it a go,\" she said.\n\"Technique is the hardest thing to learn. There are so many little factors to it. I started wading in, but it's all about timing and being patient.\n\"I've learned straight away it's not like being Rocky, you can't just get in there and blast away.\n\"I've come in thinking I'm hardcore and can have a scrap, but it's the total opposite to be honest, it's kind of like taekwondo in that it's a game of chess, but with your hands.\"\nAs well as two Olympic gold medals, Jade Jones won a World Championship, three-European Championships and won 10 Grand Prix titles in taekwondo\nOne of Wales' most successful Olympians, Jones admits there is a degree of sadness at giving up taekwondo, having represented Team GB at four Olympics and having won two gold medals, as well as winning a World Championship.\nJones became the youngest Team GB Olympic gold medallist when she sensationally won gold at her first attempt, as a 19-year-old at the 2012 London Games and held on to her crown four years later in Rio de Janeiro.\nDisappointment followed at the 2020 Tokyo Games which she later described as the \"biggest low\" of her career.\nAt Paris 2024, Jones' bid for Olympic history ended in early defeat in the taekwondo -57kg first round.\nShe was bidding to become the first three-time Olympic champion in the sport's history and defeat left Jones \"devastated\".\nJones lost to Macedonia's Miljana Reljikj on the number of registered hits, used as a tie-breaker after three even rounds.\nJones - whose Paris build-up had been overshadowed by the controversy of a missed drugs test, but was later cleared by the UK Anti-Doping Agency - has now chosen to step away from the sport she loves.\n\"My family have been a little bit sad about me giving up taekwondo,\" she added.\n\"I've never used my hands. After 20 years of using my feet I am switching it up.\n\"Boxing is good for me. It started as a distraction but now I am going to go for it, because I am just loving it.\"\nThis video can not be played\nJade Jones switch to boxing\nJones' trainer Smith, who twice boxed for a world title, admits he was initially sceptical about Jones' boxing ambitions. \n\"My first instinct was why? Why would someone who kicks with both feet get into a sport where you use your hands,\" he said. \n\"I wasn't doubting her, but I was confused. I don't think it's ever happened before, I don't know anyone who has come over from taekwondo.\n\"It's a massive challenge but it is made easier by her attitude... she's improving all the time.\"\nThis video can not be played\nJade Jones: 'Taekwondo has been my whole life'\nJade Jones and Stephen 'Swifty' Smith is a terrific boxing partnership.\nJones is an aggressive, competitive fighter in taekwondo and she will need an old-school boxing coach to help with her transition.\nSmith, a former British champion and one of the four fighting Smith brothers from the Rotunda club In Liverpool, is a calm head in the gym and corner; Jones will need that as she forgets her kicks and perfects her hooks.\nThe initial transition will not be difficult, but turning Jones into a genuine contender will take time. Jones has good feet, fast hands and, as a world-class fighter, she has great awareness.\nThe fairy tale will mostly be conducted behind closed doors at the gym in long days of sparring and boring repetition; Jones will need to slow down, pick her punches and react to getting hit and hit and hit.\nSwifty will insist that she \"shapes up\" well before letting her apply for a British licence to fight; the British Boxing Board will not just grant her a licence based on her glory in another sport. She will need to display the basics, learn boxing balance and simple punches - that might be frustrating for her; all crossover athletes want to run before they can walk.\nThere are only 13 active featherweights in Britain and Jones will be an excellent addition. She will also do some damage if she learns the basics - too many female fighters never bother to get an education and that is why the gulf at the top is so wide. Jones can bridge that gap.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode",

        "article_text": "\"China will fight to the bitter end of any trade war,\" the foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing declared, after China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on agricultural imports from the US.\nThis came within minutes of a new 10% US levy on Chinese imports that came into effect on Tuesday - which adds to existing tariffs both from Trump's first term and those announced last month.\nBut China's latest retaliatory measures are an opening swing, not a direct punch.\nIt shows some strength, and it has the potential to sting parts of the United States, but also leaves room to negotiate or escalate if necessary.\n\"We advise the US to put away its bullying face and return to the right track of dialogue and co-operation before it is too late,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian added.\nThis is the second round of tariffs the two countries have imposed on each other since February. But this time China is hitting Donald Trump where it has the potential to hurt - by targeting farmers, who are some of his core supporters.\nAlmost 78% of farming-dependent counties in the US endorsed Mr Trump in 2024.\nChina is one of their biggest customers for produce such as chicken, beef, pork and soybeans and now all those products will face a 10-15% tax which will come into effect on 10 March.\n\"The tariffs are broadly negative for US agricultural markets. It is going to have a bearish influence on prices. There are enough corn and soybean supplies in the world for China to make a switch, it is more of an issue for the US, because 30% of US soybeans still go to China,\" Ole Houe, of Ikon commodities, told Reuters news agency.\nBeijing may hope that this will apply some pressure on the Trump administration ahead of any potential negotiations.\nThe latest announcements raise the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world's top two economies and in various ministry statements, China is making two things very clear.\nFirstly, it is prepared to continue to fight.\n\"Pressure, coercion and threats are not the right way to deal with the Chinese side,\" said Mr Lin.\nBut secondly, it is also willing to talk.\nBeijing is not ramping up the rhetoric or the tariffs in the same way it did in 2018, during the last Trump administration. Back then it imposed a tariff of 25% on US soybeans.\n\"China's tariffs impact a limited number of US products, and remain below the 20% level. This is by design. China's government is signalling that they do not want to escalate, they want to de-escalate,\" according to Even Pay, an analyst with Trivium China.\nThe prospect of talks was raised last month. The White House said there would be a call between President Xi and Donald Trump. That never happened.\nSo will these talks take place and who will make the first move?\nChina is unlikely to want to go first. It will not want to be seen kowtowing to Washington.\nAnd in contrast to Canada and Mexico, Beijing has not announced new measures to target the flow of fentanyl. It simply repeated past statements that fentanyl is a \"US problem\" and that China has the strictest drug policies in the world.\nOn Tuesday, the State Council released a White Paper titled \"Controlling Fentanyl-related substances - China's contribution\".\nIt outlines the measures Beijing says it has already made to crack down on Fentanyl-related crimes and the precursor chemicals used to make the drug. It adds that it is \"diligently fulfilling international drug control obligations\".\nSo, while China hasn't picked up the phone to Washington, this document forms part of the country's message which appears to be saying - we are already doing what we can on fentanyl.\nDespite stating that China \"will not yield\", these latest tariffs are bound to sting.\nThe cumulative 20% tax on all Chinese goods comes on top of a slew of tariffs Trump imposed in his first term on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports. And China's population is already concerned about a sluggish economy.\nThousands of delegates are gathering in the capital this week to take part in an annual parliamentary session, most of which will focus on the economy.\nHouse prices are still falling, and youth unemployment remains stubbornly high. A potential trade war with the US could prompt more money worries for businesses and consumers across the country at a time when the Communist Party wants people to spend to help the economy to grow.\nBut Beijing will also see an opportunity as Donald Trump sows uncertainty among his international allies. \nIt can partly place the blame for any further economic woes at Washington's door and state that it's the fault of the US for starting a trade war.\nThe state media outlet Xinhua has in recent days released a series of parodies poking fun at a United States that is prepared to tax its allies and neighbours. The skits portray Washington as a bully echoing the words coming from the leaders of Canada and Mexico.\nAt the same time, China's Commerce Ministry has reiterated that it is prepared to work with other countries around the world to combat Mr Trump's tariffs.\nBeijing appears to be looking for potential allies in this trade war while also trying to cast Washington as a troublemaker who is prepared to target friends and foes alike.\nAll at a time when Donald Trump's \"America First\" doctrine has many in Europe and the UK wondering if the US-led world order is already in doubt.",

But do you think he really understands history?\"\nHis comments were \"deeply disappointing\" and made his position \"untenable\", New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\nHis comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week.\nHe contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germany's threats. \nMr Goff quoted how Churchill had rebuked then UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain: \"You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war.\"\nPeters said Mr Goff's views did not represent those of the New Zealand government.\n\"When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, you're not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand,\" local media reported Peters saying.\n\"It's not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically,\" he said, adding that he would have taken the same course of action no matter which country was being spoken about.\nMr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence.\nPeters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.\nWhen it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: \"I know he's the prime minister, I made him the prime minister.\"\nThe 79-year-old, who has previously worked with Mr Goff in government, leads the New Zealand First political party - which joined Luxon's National Party and the Act Party in 2023 to form the current ruling centre-right coalition government. \nLuxon, for his part, said Peters' decision to fire Mr Goff without first consulting him was \"entirely appropriate\". \nFormer Prime Minister Helen Clark was among those who criticised Mr Goff's sacking, saying it was backed by a \"very thin excuse\".\n\"I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 and US actions now,\" she wrote in a post on X.\nUnder the 1938 Munich Agreement, Hitler took control of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland. The deal failed to stop Nazi Germany from advancing deeper into Europe and World War Two began when he invaded Poland in 1939.",

The S&P 500 closed 1.2% lower.\nAmerican retailers and carmakers were among the hardest hit, with electronics chain Best Buy's share price closing more than 13% lower.\nThe company had warned earlier on Tuesday that the tariffs would lead to higher prices for its shoppers. \n\"The giant wildcard obviously is how the consumers are going to react to the price increases in light of a lot of price increases potentially throughout the year,\" said Best Buy's chief financial officer Matt Bilunas.\nTrump said he was imposing the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in response to what he said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US.\nTrudeau called that justification \"completely bogus\" and warned that Canada's retaliatory measures would hurt. \nHe said Canada would first hit $30bn worth of products, and target the remaining $125bn over 21 days.\nAny fresh duties Canada imposes will be in place \"until the US trade action is withdrawn\", he said.\n\"Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight, not when our country and the wellbeing of every one in it is at stake,\" he said.\nAddressing Trump directly, he added: \"Donald, you're a very smart guy. But this is a very dumb thing to do.\"\nChina also swiftly announced its own counter-measures, which include 10-15% tariffs on some US agricultural goods including wheat, corn, beef and soybeans. China is the US's biggest buyer of these goods.\n\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.\nTrump said he would respond to retaliation with a plan, due in April, for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nThese would be tailor-made to each country and take into account areas such as the trade balance with the US and other taxes, such as VAT.\nTrump has also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on the EU, recently claiming that the bloc had been \"formed to screw the United States\".\nEurope has pledged to hit back, but no tariffs have been implemented yet.\nTrump is hoping that imposing tariffs on the goods that the US buys will force foreign companies to invest in America, boost tax revenues and grow the economy.\nHe has argued the tariffs - which are a tax paid by the business importing the product - will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs as foreign companies switch to production in America. \nBut tariffs also tend to trigger retaliation from targeted countries, disadvantaging domestic businesses looking to export goods, meaning the measures can ultimately hold back trade.\nAnalysts have warned that tariffs could lead to economic recessions, push up prices for US households and could also have a knock-on effect on consumers across the world, including in the UK.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said that regardless of whether the UK avoids tariffs, they will have a knock-on effect.\n\"I don't think it serves anyone well,\" she said. \"And it's absolutely the case that even if tariffs aren't applied to the UK, we will be affected by slowing global trade, by a slower [economic] growth and by higher inflation than otherwise would be the case.\"\nIf inflation rises, it could affect the pace at which interest rates are cut.\nCompanies could choose to absorb the cost of the extra tax. Chipotle said that the restaurant chain would take that route - for now.\n\"It is our intent today to hold pricing constant because we don't know if the tariffs are transitory, if they're going to be permanent, or how they will impact our business in the future,\" said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's corporate affairs chief.\nBut, like Best Buy, other US retailers warned that prices would rise. \nTarget's boss Brian Cornell said shoppers were likely to see increases over the next couple of days for foods such as avocados, bananas and strawberries.\nMexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US market each year.\nWalmart said it would try to keep prices \"as low as possible\".\n\"In the meantime, we encourage all parties to work towards finding common ground that will protect consumers from price hikes and continue to grow our economy,\" it said.\nCarmakers are also bracing for a hit.\nFord chief executive Jim Farley warned last month the business \"could handle two weeks of tariffs\".\nHe told Bloomberg: \"We could see billions of billions of dollars of pressure on the industry, lost jobs, lots of impacts to communities.\"",

        "article_text": "Martin Odegaard scored two of Arsenal's seven goals against PSV Eindhoven\nEindhoven has been packed with carnival-goers in recent days but on Tuesday it was Arsenal enjoying their own party in the city, getting over their goalscoring crisis and setting a Champions League record in the process.\nMikel Arteta's side became the first team in Champions League history to score seven goals away from home in the knockout stages of the competition as they romped to a 7-1 win over PSV Eindhoven.\nIt was the most goals the Gunners have scored in a single game since beating Newcastle 7-3 in the Premier League 13 years ago.\nThe Arsenal manager said the win had given his players \"joy and confidence and belief\", but was not getting carried away when questions were put to him about the records that his team had broken.\n\"For sure, it's something that hasn't been done, so great to be part of that,\" Arteta said. \"But as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that.\n\"The happiest thing is we are in a very strong position to go to the next round, which is where we want to be.\n\"But there's still a job to do in London in a week's time.\"\nAfter failing to score in their past two games, a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest and 1-0 defeat by West Ham, Arteta may not have seen a victory like this coming. \n\"This will give them great confidence for the rest of the season. Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too. He took it well  and we're all there to support and I'm sure he will learn from that too.\"\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes took over England's Test side in 2022\nEngland would be \"stupid\" not to consider Ben Stokes as a white-ball captain, says director of men's cricket Rob Key.\nEngland are looking for new leaders of the one-day and T20 sides after Jos Buttler resigned following their early exit at the Champions Trophy.\nStokes, 33, has been Test captain since 2022 but has not played white-ball cricket for England since the 2023 50-over World Cup.\n\"Nothing is off the table,\" said Key. \"You look at every single option and think, 'What is the best thing to do?'\n\"Ben Stokes is one of the best captains I've ever seen. It would be stupid not to look at him. It's just the knock-on effect of what that means.\"\nAll-rounder Stokes is currently recovering from a hamstring operation and has been training with a group of England Lions players in Abu Dhabi.\nKey said Stokes is \"flying\" and \"on track to start the summer in a full role, bowling and batting\".\nOn Saturday, in the aftermath of England's defeat against South Africa in their final match at the Champions Trophy, head coach Brendon McCullum did not rule out having different captains in each of the three formats.\nEngland bowler Carse to miss IPL because of injury\nMcCullum does not rule out making outsider captain\nOn Thursday at Lord's, Key said England will not rush the decision and have \"plenty of options\", but he sees a greater alignment between Test and 50-over cricket, when compared to the T20 format.\nIt could be a possibility that Stokes combines the 50-over leadership with the Test side, working alongside a different T20 captain.\n\"I believe that Test cricket and 50-over cricket are probably closer than T20s, which is the outlier now,\" said Key.\nKey also mentioned current white-ball vice-captain Harry Brook and limited-overs specialists Phil Salt and Liam Livingstone, who have both led England in the past year.\nIf Stokes or Brook take a white-ball leadership role, their workload would come into consideration, particularly in a year when England face marquee Test series at home to India and away to Australia.\nA home white-ball series against West Indies begins only four days after a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May, while the summer ends with limited-overs matches against South Africa and Ireland.\nEngland play a white-ball series in New Zealand prior to the Ashes, which is then followed by a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka early next year. \nStokes was man of the match when England won the 50-over World Cup in 2019 and played a major role when they were crowned T20 world champions in 2022.\nHe retired from 50-over cricket in the summer of 2022 and reversed the decision to play in the 2023 World Cup.\n\"We've got to get the most out of our best players,\" said Key. \"We want them playing for England.\n\"That's important and that's going to take some work because you're also throwing franchise cricket into that.\n\"But I believe our players are committed to playing for England as much as they can.\"\nFive issues for England after Buttler resigns\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nKey said he expects pace bowler Brydon Carse to be fit for the start of the summer after a foot injury cut short his Champions Trophy and ruled him out of the Indian Premier League.\nMark Wood will see a specialist this week about a knee injury picked up at the Champions Trophy.\nEngland's performance in Pakistan was their third successive disappointing global white-ball event. They suffered narrowed defeats by Australia and Afghanistan, then were hammered by South Africa.\nKey admitted England were \"very poor\" and said they could have chosen a different bowling attack after coming under fire for being too reliant on high pace.\nBut the former Kent and England player pointed towards the performance of the batting, which he said has \"fallen off a cliff\".\nHe rejected allegations England do not train enough, though did concede some of their statements in the media \"do not help\" the public perception of the team.\n\"There's no doubt that we've got to get better,\" said Key. \"When we're doing interviews, when players are doing their post-match press conferences, whatever it is, we speak a lot of rubbish a lot of the time.\n\"They're trying so hard not to upset players in the dressing room, not try and give away something that they don't think they should.\n\"Then they end up creating headlines for that, but I don't kill people for really the things they say.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Stokes considered as England white-ball captainImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes took over England's Test side in 2022Stephan ShemiltChief Cricket Reporter at Lord'sPublished6 March 2025621 CommentsEngland would be \"stupid\" not to consider Ben Stokes as a white-ball captain, says director of men's cricket Rob Key.England are looking for new leaders of the one-day and T20 sides after Jos Buttler resigned following their early exit at the Champions Trophy.Stokes, 33, has been Test captain since 2022 but has not played white-ball cricket for England since the 2023 50-over World Cup. \"All-rounder Stokes is currently recovering from a hamstring operation and has been training with a group of England Lions players in Abu Dhabi.Key said Stokes is \"flying\" and \"on track to start the summer in a full role, bowling and batting\".On Saturday, in the aftermath of England's defeat against South Africa in their final match at the Champions Trophy, head coach Brendon McCullum did not rule out having different captains in each of the three formats.England bowler Carse to miss IPL because of injuryPublished16 hours agoMcCullum does not rule out making outsider captainPublished5 days agoOn Thursday at Lord's, Key said England will not rush the decision and have \"plenty of options\", but he sees a greater alignment between Test and 50-over cricket, when compared to the T20 format.It could be a possibility that Stokes combines the 50-over leadership with the Test side, working alongside a different T20 captain. \"I believe that Test cricket and 50-over cricket are probably closer than T20s, which is the outlier now,\" said Key.Key also mentioned current white-ball vice-captain Harry Brook and limited-overs specialists Phil Salt and Liam Livingstone, who have both led England in the past year.If Stokes or Brook take a white-ball leadership role, their workload would come into consideration, particularly in a year when England face marquee Test series at home to India and away to Australia.A home white-ball series against West Indies begins only four days after a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May, while the summer ends with limited-overs matches against South Africa and Ireland.England play a white-ball series in New Zealand prior to the Ashes, which is then followed by a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka early next year. \"But I believe our players are committed to playing for England as much as they can.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump said he would cut funding for universities that allow what he called \"illegal\" protests and prosecute and deport foreign students who participate. \nOn his Truth Social social media platform, Trump said that \"all federal funding will STOP\" for schools that permit students to protest illegally. \nTrump's announcement comes less than a year after massive student protests against Israel's war in Gaza swept across US college campuses, including Columbia University in New York and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \nAmerican students will be expelled, Trump said. \nTrump did not specify what would constitute an \"illegal\" protest. Broadly speaking, the right to protest is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. \nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as Fire, swiftly condemned Trump's announcement. \n\"Colleges can and should respond to unlawful conduct, but the president does not have unilateral authority to revoke federal funds, even for colleges that allow 'illegal' protests,\" the statement said. \nThe group added that the move will \"cast an impermissible chill on student protests about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\". \nIn a separate announcement, the US Department of Education, General Services Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services said they would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of Columbia's federal contracts amid an ongoing investigation into compliance with Title VI, a federal law that bans discrimination based on ethnicity or ancestry. \nIn a statement, the education department said that it is considering stop work orders for $51.4m (\u00a340.19m) in contracts with the New York City-based university, and will review more than $5bn in grant commitments to the school. \n\"Americans have watched in horror for more than a year now, as Jewish students have been assaulted and harassed on elite university campuses - repeatedly overrun by antisemitic students and agitators,\" Trump's new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, said in a statement. \nMcMahon added that \"unlawful encampments and demonstrations have completely paralysed day-to-day campus operations, depriving Jewish students of learning opportunities to which they are entitled\". \nIn January, Trump signed an executive order that called for the removal of foreign students who participated in protests. \nThe order also directed government departments to make recommendations that could allow educational institutions to \"monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff\" and, if warranted, remove them. \nA White House fact sheet on the order specified that it seeks to \"protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities\". \nIn April 2024, student protests against the war in Gaza drew national attention after students at Columbia were arrested at a student encampment set up on campus. \nThousands of arrests were ultimately made at dozens of universities across the country. \nAt Columbia, the university authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building.\nFour months after protests rocked the campus, Columbia president Minouche Shafik resigned. \nEarlier this week, a federal task force announced it would visit 10 prominent US universities that have been the scene of anti-semitic incidents.

But today he reacted fantastic, playing focused, serious, saving one action that was a goal.\n\"Of course I know the difficulties in football and how we can have experiences and how we can get better and analyse everything deeply and try and correct it - that is my only target with the players.\n\"We corrected something from the match we played here.\"\nThis was Villa's first knockout tie in European football's premier competition since the 1982-83 quarter-finals - and Emery's side are certainly making up for lost time. \nClub Brugge, who wasted at least two good chances, will feel they did not deserve to lose 3-1, but Villa have given themselves a golden chance to go through to the last eight.\nEmery, however, is not getting carried away.\n\"We are not in the quarter-finals,\" the Spaniard was quick to point out.\n\"There's still 90 minutes to play. We're ready in case we need extra time and penalties because I know how difficult it is in each match.\n\"The players, I'm sure they have experiences before as well with matches like that and we have to respect the opponent always.\n\"They won against Atalanta 3-1 [in the knockout-round play-offs] and they compete very well.\n\"We need to watch the match again with the players to understand the difficulties we can face against teams in Europe.\n\"I am happy but calm, getting balance.\"\nAston Villa scored more goals in this match (three) than they had in their previous five meetings with Belgian sides in all competitions combined (two)",

He stood at about 5ft tall (150cm), wore a surgical face mask and communicated in a packed courtroom via an interpreter.\nAfter a brief hearing that discussed his lack of assets and need for a defence lawyer, the federal judge overseeing the case ordered Sharifullah to be held in custody until a formal detention hearing on Monday.\nSeveral justice department officials who were recently appointed to office by Trump praised the president for the arrest, and FBI chief Kash Patel shared an image of him in custody.\n\"Under President Trump's strong leadership on the world stage, this Department of Justice will ensure that terrorists like Mohammad Sharifullah have no safe haven, no second chances, and no worse enemy than the United States of America,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said.\nA family member of two Afghans who died in the aftermath of the attack said he was upset with Trump after the speech. \n\"He talked about the 13 US soldiers killed but not anything about us,\" he told the BBC. \"We want the Americans to pay attention to us and take us to America as they promised,\" the man added. \nThe bombing of Abbey Gate at the Kabul airport occurred in the final days of the chaotic US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week.\nIt is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from America's two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets.\nOn Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25% import levies just a day after they came into effect.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canada's finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a \"colourful\" conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump.\nThe US president used profane language more than once during Wednesday's heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports. \nTrudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief.\n\"Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\" he said.\nA first round of Canadian retaliation targeting C$30bn ($21bn, \u00a316bn) of US goods is already in effect.\nThe trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence. \nOn Thursday afternoon, the leading US stock indexes were all lower, with the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest American companies, ending down nearly 1.8%.\nIn signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market. \n\"Nothing to do with the market,\" Trump said. \"I'm not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening.\"\nThe carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term. Items that currently come into the US under the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide.\nA White House official said about 50% of US imports from Mexico and 62% from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order.\nThe White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored, \"reciprocal\" trade duties on countries around the world.\nTrump said he agreed to grant the exemptions until 2 April after a phone call with Sheinbaum and they were aimed at helping carmakers and parts suppliers. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.  \nSheinbaum said on Thursday that she had had an \"excellent and respectful\" call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, said afterwards that \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\". \nEarlier, as relief looked likely but before it was announced, he told CNN that the province still planned to go ahead with a 25% tariff on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota from Monday.\n\"Honestly, it really bothers me. We have to do this, but I don't want to do this,\" he said.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday dismissed retaliation as counter-productive for trade negotiations. \n\"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh we're going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. \nGoods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and the economies of the three countries are deeply integrated after decades of free trade. \nTrump has argued introducing tariffs will protect American industry and boost manufacturing. However, many economists say tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US, while warning they could trigger severe economic downturns in Mexico and Canada. \nAbout $1bn in trade enters the US from Mexico and Canada each day that does not claim duty-free exemptions under USMCA, since it has historically enjoyed low or no tariffs, said Daniel Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide.\n\"Whether importers can or will start claiming USMCA remains to be seen, but it's a huge amount of money at stake,\" he said. \nIn the US, the economy is already starting to show the effects of the disruption from Trump's policies. \nImports spiked in January on the back of tariff fears, with America's trade deficit increasing 34% to more than $130bn (\u00a3100bn), the Commerce Department reported. \nGregory Brown, who leads BenLee, a company that makes big trailers, said he had had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trump's policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nBut Mr Brown, who attended Mr Bessent's speech, said that for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices \u2013 a sign that the economy is holding up.\n\"It's a great growth economy,\" he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trump's decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs as a sign of a business-friendly president adjusting to the \"business reality\".\nOthers were more worried that the back-and-forth would cause economic damage.\n\"I think we're going to have a recession before whatever succeeds in the future,\" one investment manager said. \"You're going to get the bad before you get the good.\"",

        "article_text": "The speaker of the house in New Zealand's parliament says he will not consider any further complaints from lawmakers over the use of the country's M\u0101ori name in proceedings.\n\"Aotearoa is regularly used as a name of New Zealand,\" Speaker Gerry Brownlee said in a ruling in Parliament on Tuesday. \nHis comments come after Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters asked Brownlee to bar the use of the name Aotearoa, and suggested a referendum would be needed for anyone to use it in parliament. \nWhile New Zealand is the legal name of the country and can only be changed by law, Aotearoa, which translates to \"land of the long white cloud\", has long been used when referring to New Zealand in M\u0101ori.\n\"It [Aotearoa] appears on our passports and it appears on our currency,\" Brownlee said on Tuesday. The name is also used in the M\u0101ori version of New Zealand's national anthem, which is commonly heard before the English version. \n\"If other members do not like certain words, they don't have to use them. But it's not a matter of order, and I don't expect to have further points of order raised about it,\" he added. \nMPs are allowed to use any of the country's three official languages - English, M\u0101ori and New Zealand sign language - when speaking in Parliament. \nThe objection by Peters, who is M\u0101ori, arose last month, when Green MP Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez March used it during a parliamentary session.\n\"Why is someone who applied to come to this country in 2006 allowed to ask a question of this Parliament that changes this country's name without the referendum and sanction of the New Zealand people?\" Peters asked.\nMen\u00e9ndez March is originally from Mexico but is a New Zealand citizen, as all MPs must be. \nShane Jones, another government minister who is a member of Peters' New Zealand First party and is also M\u0101ori, questioned \"the appropriateness of recent immigrants telling M\u0101ori what the name of our country should be?\"\nAt the time, Brownlee encouraged lawmakers to use the name Aotearoa New Zealand instead in order to avoid any confusion but said it was not a requirement. \nNot all M\u0101ori have the same connection to the name Aotearoa, which was originally used to describe New Zealand's North Island only. However, it is often used by non-M\u0101ori out of respect for indigenous people. \nWinston Peters said on Tuesday that he disagreed with Brownlee's ruling, Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported.\nHe added that he only had a problem with Aotearoa being used in Parliament, not of M\u0101ori in general, and that, if a question was addressed to him in future using the name, he would not answer. \nThe use of M\u0101ori in public has grown considerably across New Zealand in recent decades, following advocacy from indigenous leaders. \nA petition was launched in 2022 by the M\u0101ori Party, an official political party, to officially change the country's name to Aotearoa, which received more than 70,000 signatures.\n\"New Zealand is a Dutch name and has no connection to this whenua [land]. How many people in Aotearoa can even point to 'old' Zealand on a map?\" M\u0101ori Party Co-leader Rawiri Waititi said at the time. \nSince the current administration came into power in 2023, it has required that government departments prioritise their English names and communicate primarily in English, unless they are specifically related to M\u0101ori.\nAnother of the coalition's members, the Act party, is also seeking to redefine the terms of New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, which has been met with fierce opposition.

Fifa's reserves, which are there for global football development, will remain untouched.\"\nThe ECA is yet to comment publicly about the negotiations.\nHow does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?\nFifa to introduce Women's Club World Cup in 2028\nDAZN secures exclusive Fifa Club World Cup rights\nThe ECA is expected to gain a higher revenue share than clubs from other continents because of the importance of their clubs to the competition, and because those members will be unable to play lucrative overseas pre-season tours.\nChelsea, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Inter Milan, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Benfica, Porto and FC Salzburg are all represented by the ECA. \nReal Madrid are not part of the ECA because of their ongoing support for a breakaway European Super League.\nThe ECA has committed to supporting the Club World Cup until at least 2030 through a memorandum of understanding signed in 2023. \nMultiple sources from outside Europe have expressed their support both publicly and privately for the competition, although they remain in the dark about how much they will receive for participation.\nInfantino said in December: \"Whatever Fifa does, [it] has to be global.\n\"[Fifa] has to involve the globe. [Fifa] has to give opportunities and chances to  [everyone] all over the world, and the Club World Cup is doing exactly that.\"\nThere will be a Fifa Council meeting to update members on the progress of the tournament, which will be hosted in 12 stadiums across 11 US cities during the month-long summer event. \nThe Confederation of African Football (CAF) is understood to be negotiating on behalf of the African club interest. Chairman of the African Club Association (ACA) and board member of the CAF Hersi A. Said told BBC Sport: \"Africa is represented by four clubs Al-Ahly, Wydad AC, ES Tunis and Mamelodi Sundowns.\n\"To start with, we are happy with four and we will push to get more clubs in the next editions. To be honest, we don't have much information on TV rights or solidarity payments but we would love the same platform to discuss this.

        "summary": "Fifa to give $1bn as Europe nears Club World Cup dealImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Fifa will expand the Club World Cup to 32 teams for the first time this summer at an event to take place every four yearsNizaar KinsellaBBC Sport football news reporterPublished5 March 2025Fifa is set to give more than $1bn in prize money to clubs participating in the Club World Cup as the European Club Association (ECA), negotiating on behalf of clubs in Europe including Chelsea and Manchester City, closes in on a deal.Multiple sources have confirmed to BBC Sport that the 32 clubs involved, including 12 European clubs, will split what is anticipated to be the biggest prize in club football across a seven-match format.It is partly based on the $1bn exclusive global TV deal agreed with sports streaming service DAZN in December.The inaugural tournament, taking place in the United States, begins on 14 June and finishes with the final in New Jersey on 13 July.On an individual club basis, those involved will receive a participation fee for entering the group stage and performance fees based on progression to later rounds.Multiple senior sources have explained that Fifa and the ECA are also in talks about bringing in substantial solidarity payments for non-participating clubs, which is expected to be followed by similar distributions for clubs in Africa, Asia and the Americas at a later date. \"The Fifa Club World Cup will not only be the pinnacle of club football, but also a vivid demonstration of solidarity that will benefit clubs at large to a scale that no other competition has ever done,\" said Fifa president Gianni Infantino. \"The ECA is yet to comment publicly about the negotiations.How does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?Published5 December 2024Fifa to introduce Women's Club World Cup in 2028Published16 hours agoDAZN secures exclusive Fifa Club World Cup rightsPublished4 December 2024The ECA is expected to gain a higher revenue share than clubs from other continents because of the importance of their clubs to the competition, and because those members will be unable to play lucrative overseas pre-season tours.Chelsea, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Inter Milan, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Benfica, Porto and FC Salzburg are all represented by the ECA. \"All revenue generated by the tournament will be distributed to the participating clubs, and via club solidarity across the world, as Fifa will not keep a single dollar. [Fifa] has to give opportunities and chances to  [everyone] all over the world, and the Club World Cup is doing exactly that.",

        "article_text": "Are you warm, cool or neutral? How the retro trend of \"getting your colours done\" made a comeback with personalised colour analysis on social media \u2013 and how your perfect colours can \"spark careers, conversations and connections\".\nDo you have cool or medium undertones? Does red brighten your skin or dull you down?\u00a0Questions like these, that may not have crossed your mind before, are now prominent on social media, as users try to define their colour palettes.\u00a0Colour analysis, once considered niche, has seen a surge in popularity, with appointments booked months in advance and apps including TikTok and Instagram flooded with tutorials on how to determine which colours suit you.\u00a0\n\"Before I started offering online consultations, I had people fly in from around the world to see me,\" says Canadian image consultant and colour analyst Carol Brailey.\u00a0\nSince Brailey launched her business back in 2012, and has done thousands of consultations. \"It appeals to people from all walks of life,\" she tells the BBC. \"There's everyone from 17-year-olds to those in their 70s \u2013 I find people are tired of gravitating towards black clothing.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nOn TikTok, Brailey's client transformations have gained millions of views, as has the hashtag #ColorAnalysis, which is often accompanied by filters allowing users to find their palette. But although this technology is new, the practice has been around for decades.\u00a0\u00a0\nColour analysis enjoyed a spell of popularity in the 1980s and early-90s, when \"getting your colours done\" meant visiting a professional colour consultant in person, and being assigned a particular set of hues \u2013 often based on a system of seasons \u2013 that suited you. Broadly speaking, spring meant bright and fresh colours, summer cool and light, autumn was burnt oranges and mossy greens, and winter was deep jewel tones. This surge in interest was largely thanks to the bestselling books Color Me Beautiful by Carole Jackson (which sold more than 13 million copies worldwide) and Color Me a Season by Bernice Kentner.\nHowever, it was in the early-1900s that seasonal colour theory was born in the studio of Johannes Itten, a Swiss painter and art professor. Itten noticed that some of his students' portraits looked more vibrant than others, a difference he attributed to colour. By analysing colours that \"harmonised\" well together, he developed the seasonal analysis tool still used today, grouping people into summer, autumn, winter or spring.\u00a0\nBrailey puts the modern-day revival down to how visual we have become. \"Whether it's uploading Instagram pictures, recording TikTok content, or even Zoom meetings, we have become a very visual society.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter her consultations, it's not unusual to see tears, she says. \"People cry because they've never seen themselves look so vibrant. In my years of being in the industry, I have witnessed people's lives change, with promotions and new jobs, because it starts a confidence boost.\"\u00a0\nTabitha Lofts didn't cry after her colour consultation, but she did opt to have a total makeover, dyeing her hair, switching up her make-up routine, and introducing colours to her wardrobe that she hadn't previously worn.\u00a0\"I did the whole shebang\", she laughs, adding, \"I liked it, and I felt so different.\" Before her consultation, Tabitha thought she had a warm spring or summer palette, explaining, \"I was so sure that I was warm toned, because I burn in the Sun, but it was the complete opposite.\u00a0I learnt I'm cool toned, suit silver jewellery, and my favourite colours weren't my colours at all. Now I wear lots of cobalt blue, a shade I'd never worn before.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n- How one surprising image kick-started the 90s\n- How to transform your home with art\n- How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\nFor Lofts, who is a nutritionist and content creator, colour analysis was a way of building confidence.\u00a0\"I was quitting fake tan, as I was addicted, and relied on it to bring my outfits together,\" she says. \"It was confidence in a bottle, but I need to find it elsewhere.\" She described getting dressed and not \"understanding\" her skin tone, which is where she got the idea for the image consultation.\u00a0\"The results really changed my mind about my pale skin. I used to think about it with negative connotations and assumed it made me look icy, but now I know I can be warm, even without warm visuals.\"\u00a0\nTo those who are dismissive of colour analysis, Lofts admits it is not the be all and end all. \"Although I got a lot from it, I still wear colours that aren't in my palette. It's not a prescription.\"\u00a0\nGrowing up in Costa Rica, fashion designer and stylist Micah Lumsden has always gravitated towards bright colours, as she finds that wearing them lifts her mood. But it was an experience while at fashion school that made her want to better understand colour theory.\u00a0\"We were studying colour analysis, and my skin tone wasn't understood by my teachers. I got several back-up consultations from other students, but there were so many misconceptions about dark skin,\" she tells the BBC. \"Comments like, 'Every black person looks good in red,' as well as the idea that 'those with darker skin look good in every colour'.\"\u00a0\nIt was this lack of awareness that prompted Lumsden to launch styling consultancy Cocoa Styling. \"I started working with painters and make-up artists, the people who really understand colour theory.\"\u00a0She now has clients around the world, and has noticed more male clients on her books. \"Guys do care about fashion,\" she says. \"I used to see one man per 10 clients, but now it's one per five.\"\u00a0\nAs a stylist, she approaches wardrobes with colour at the forefront, rather than design. \"Most people will look good in a tailored blazer and T-shirt, but the personalisation of colour gives an outfit a special touch.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nColour analysis is often expensive, but Lumsden doesn't want that to be a deterrent. She's also sceptical of online colour-analysis filters being the answer. \"It's hard to give an unbiased reading of filters, and screens also reflect light.\"\nInstead, she suggests holding up items from around the home against your face, or going to a local craft store to buy felt patches. \"You can use blankets, cushions... whatever. Hold them up against your face in the mirror, and take a selfie. Once you've got a collection of selfies, place them next to each other and ask, do I look better with blue and purples? Or yellows and oranges? If it's the latter, you have a warm palette, if it's the former, you're probably cool.\"\u00a0\nWe know fashion runs in cycles, but many believe that knowing your personal palette could be a way to break up with fast fashion. \"Trends rotate so quickly, so knowing your best colours is a great way of harnessing what suits you and eliminating everything else,\" Ellie Richards tells the BBC. She's the founder of Nuude Studio in Queenstown, New Zealand, and approaches fashion through psychology. Colour, in her opinion, is the most important tool.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There is a science to clothes changing your mood, your behaviour and people's perception of you,\" she says. \"When you put on a colour that suits you, it's a powerful tool, because we're instantly more confident and aligned in personal identity.\"\u00a0\nThe easiest way to see colour psychology in action, she says, is in films and TV series. \"If we look at Euphoria, for example, Cassie (played by Sydney Sweeney) is often dressed in light blue to show an angel-like innocence, whereas Maddy (played by Alexa Demie) dresses in more dark maroon tones to signify her influence.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nLook at some of the trending colours of 2025, and black doesn't feature. Instead, we're seeing bold cardinal reds, striking marigolds and dusty-rose pinks. According to Richards, we've entered an era of being \"bold\".\u00a0\n\"The pandemic days of wearing grey sweats are over, and instead we've emerged seeking fun, playful looks.\" She cites social media as influencing our style, too. \"It's had a massive effect. On TikTok, creators need to stand out and they can do so by wearing bright, eye-catching colours. Those videos are seen by millions of people, and so it's normalised these bold looks.\"\nRichards is passionate about the benefits of colour analysis. \"A deep understanding of personal style and colour can spark careers, conversations and connections,\" she says, acknowledging that it can be a little daunting at first, but advising the curious to start by adding colour little by little.\u00a0\"One option is to wear muted shades of a colour, or accessories.\"\nDespite a colour consultation confirming that cobalt blue suits her best, Lofts still gravitates towards black. \"It's easy to wear,\" she says with a smile. \"But I'm trying to be more adventurous.\"\nAs a personal trainer, she sees plenty of online content pushing \"optimisation\" and \"being the best version of yourself\". She views colour analysis as part of that trend, but believes the most important thing is feeling comfortable in your own skin. \"Everyone is focused on self-improvement, and there's a vanity to it,\" she says. \"But it doesn't have to be serious.

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who plays a New York stripper.\nSince publication of this article, Anora won best picture at the Oscars and Madison won best actress.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

        "article_text": "Blue skies, picture-perfect flowers, intricately-prepared cakes and Californian sunshine streams through the windows. Oh, and another celeb turns up in the kitchen.\nIs that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.\nWe see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.\nIt's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").\nWhat you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.\n\"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,\" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.\nShe makes different types of pasta, crudit\u00e9s, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.\nThere are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt. \n\"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,\" Meghan explains. \"So I try to under salt.\"\nFriends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.\nIt's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.\nIt's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.\nWhether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.\nIt's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.\nInstead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.\nMeghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.\nAnd of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.\nIt's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.\nMeghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".\nThe hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.\nWe see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.\nMindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.\n\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.\n\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'\nMeghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".\nWe learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.\nThere's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.\n\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.\nThere are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.\nShe's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"\nAs a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here. \nIn the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".\nDoes this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.\nEverything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.\nThis series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and has doubled the levy recently put on Chinese goods.\nBut the day after these began, Trump announced a month-long exemption for US carmakers, who were expected to be badly affected. \nHe previously announced tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports.\nCanada and China have retaliated with tariffs of their own against US goods, sparking fears of a global trade war and higher prices.\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government.\nTypically, tariffs are a percentage of a product's value.  Imposing a 20% tariff on Chinese goods means a product worth $10 (\u00a37.76) would have an additional $2 charge applied to it.\nFirms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. \nThe US has typically charged lower tariffs on goods than other countries, which means his reciprocal plan could lead to a sudden and sharp increase in the tax rates - and to the prices people pay at checkout.\nTariffs are a central part of Trump's economic plans. He says tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, as well as raising tax revenue and growing the economy. \nGoods from China, Mexico and Canada accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US in 2024.\nWhen he first announced plans for new tariffs, the White House said the president was \"taking bold action to hold [the three countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country\".\nFentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year.\nThe Trump administration says the chemicals come from China, while Mexican gangs supply it illegally and run fentanyl labs in Canada. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US, most of which comes from Mexico. \nA 10% charge on all goods imported from China started on 4 February. \nTrump later said shipments worth less than $800 would be exempt.\nOn 10 February, China responded with its own tariffs, including a 10-15% tax on some US agricultural goods.\nBeijing has also targeted various US aviation, defence and tech firms by adding them to an \"unreliable entity list\" and imposing export controls. \nThe 10% levy doubled to 20% on 4 March. \nChina urged the US to return to dialogue with Beijing as soon as possible.\n\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian warned. \nTrump has introduced 25% tariffs on goods from both US neighbours, Canada and Mexico. These were originally due to begin on 4 February but finally started on 4 March. \nMeanwhile, Canadian energy imports face a 10% tariff. \nTrump had previously said the month-long delay would let the US see \"whether or not a final economic deal with Canada\" could be reached. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau criticised the tariffs as a \"very dumb thing to do\", and accused Trump of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\".\nHe said his country would immediately target C$30bn worth of products entering from the US, and goods worth a further C$125bn in 21 days.\nCanada may also restrict US access to its energy. It is the top oil supplier to the US and also provides some electricity to 30% of the states.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said he would implement his own 25% surcharge on Canadian electricity exports to three US states: Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nAnd he said he would consider completely cutting those states off from Canadian power if the US tariffs escalated. \nMexico also delayed retaliatory tariffs on US goods after the initial US pause. \nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 members of the National Guard to the US-Mexican border to \"prevent the trafficking of drugs, in particular fentanyl\".\nShe said the US had in turn agreed to increase measures to prevent the trafficking of high-powered American weapons into Mexico.\nSpeaking after Trump's tariffs came into force on 4 March, Sheinbaum said the US's decision to go ahead with 25% levies had \"no justification\" - adding that Mexico wanted respect from its northern neighbour.\nMexico will impose \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" in response, she added, and promised to set out further details on 9 March. \nThe month-long tariff exemption is for cars made in North America that comply with the continent's existing free trade agreement.\nThat deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term in office, sets out rules for how much of a car must be made in each country to qualify for duty-free treatment.\nThe Canadian and Mexican tariffs prompted fears of significant impacts on car manufacturing. Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.  \nThe average US car price could increase by $3,000 because of the import taxes, financial analyst TD Economics suggested. \nShares in Ford were up by more than 5% after the announcement, while General Motors shares rose more than 7%.\nTrump said the 25% tariff on both metals will come into effect on 12 March, with no exceptions. \nThe US is the world's largest importer of steel, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico its top three suppliers. \nCanada also provided more than 50% of the aluminium imported into the US in 2024. \nAmerican companies that use steel and aluminium to make products have warned the tariffs could push their prices up.\nThe Canadian government said the tariffs were \"totally unjustified\" and vowed swift retaliation. \nTrump previously announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 15% on aluminium in 2018, during his first term as president. However, he later negotiated exceptions for many countries including Australia, Canada and Mexico.\nDespite the exemptions, tariffs raised the average price of steel and aluminium in the US by 2.4% and 1.6% respectively, according to the US International Trade Commission.\nAll goods from China worth more than $800 are covered by the tariff. \nAll steel imports from around the world face a 25% tax. \nMexican and Canadian goods will also be subject to a 25% levy. A 10% tariff has been added to Canadian energy exports.\nGoods from Mexico that could be affected include fruit, vegetables, spirits and beer.\nIn addition to steel, Canadian goods such as timber, grains and potatoes are also likely to get more expensive. \nAn increase in the cost of Canadian oil and electricity could push up prices across the board. \nUS tariffs on imported washing machines between 2018 and 2023 increased the price of laundry equipment by 34%, according to official statistics. Prices fell once the tariffs expired.\nThe Federal Reserve of Atlanta has estimated that the Mexico and Canada tariffs, combined with adding another 10% tariff on Chinese goods, could raise prices on everyday purchases by 0.81% to 1.63%.\nSome experts suggest that Trump's new round of tariffs could prompt a wider trade war that could put prices up more generally. \nCapitol Economics said the annual rate of US inflation could increase from 2.9% to as high as 4%. \nTrump previously told the BBC the UK was \"out of line\", but suggested a solution could be \"worked out\".\nThe UK exports pharmaceutical products, cars and scientific instruments to the US. \nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK should be excluded from tariffs because it buys more from the US than it sells there. \nSpeaking in Parliament after the announcement of the steel and aluminium tariffs, Trade Minister Douglas Alexander promised a \"cool and clear-headed\" response.\nDuring his 26 February cabinet meeting, Trump said he would announce sanctions on EU goods \"very soon\".\n\"It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things,\" he added.\nThe US had a trade deficit of $213bn with the EU in 2024 - something Trump has previously described as \"an atrocity\". \nIn response, the European Commission said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".\nUS companies Harley Davidson and Jack Daniel's have previously faced EU tariffs.",

        "article_text": "The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.\nThe Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor's financial buffer has been wiped out.\nSources said \"the world has changed\" since Rachel Reeves's Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had \u00a39.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules.\nThe OBR's forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK.\nThe Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its \"major measures\" -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellor's self-imposed rules on borrowing money.\nThe government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending.\nSuch rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".\nThe spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March.\nThe Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs. \n\"Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes,\" a government insider told the BBC.\n\"The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor's response later this month.\"\nInsiders expect \"politically painful\" new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.\nAsked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a \"huge rise in the welfare budget\" and there were \"too many\" young people not in work, education or training.\n\"There's a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and there's a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable,\" she added.\nReeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits.\nLast year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.\nSome of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives which encourage some to \"game the system\". \nPeople on universal credit must show evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.\nSteve Wright, Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said any welfare cuts \"would be an outrageous attack on the poorest and most vulnerable\".\nThe chancellor will argue she hasn't changed her plans and that the government was always going to \"fix welfare to get people back to work\" and \"make the NHS more productive\".\n\"Headroom or no headroom, the chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous, with the whole government making that argument in the coming weeks,\" an insider told the BBC.\nThis week, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on its three biggest trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China. \nTrump has indicated that the UK could avoid border taxes, but Reeves has told the BBC that even if the UK is not hit by tariffs, a global trade war would lower growth and raise inflation.\nUncertainty over the war in Ukraine also remains, with the UK deciding to boost defence spending by cutting international aid.\nIn the run-up to the Spring Statement, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden and Health Secretary Wes Streeting will also outline a significant efficiency drive within the civil service, which they hope will lead to significant headcount and cost savings.\nIt is understood that the euro area economy stagnating and lower UK productivity numbers have affected the OBR's forecast.\nBut there have also been concerns raised about the impact of Reeves's previously announced tax rises on businesses, which are set to take effect in April, on the UK economy. \nInflation, which measures the rate of price rises over time, is expected to rise in the coming months as households are hit with increases to energy, water and council tax bills.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "summary": "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions2 days agoShareSaveFaisal IslamEconomics editor, BBC News\u2022@faisalislamShareSaveGetty ImagesThe chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor's financial buffer has been wiped out.Sources said \"the world has changed\" since Rachel Reeves's Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had \u00a39.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules.The OBR's forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK.The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its \"major measures\" -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellor's self-imposed rules on borrowing money.The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending.Such rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. People on universal credit must show evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.Steve Wright, Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said any welfare cuts \"would be an outrageous attack on the poorest and most vulnerable\".Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political argumentsThe seven bills due to go up in AprilWhat is the OBR and why does it matter?The chancellor will argue she hasn't changed her plans and that the government was always going to \"fix welfare to get people back to work\" and \"make the NHS more productive\". 'Huge rise in welfare spending'Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a \"huge rise in the welfare budget\" and there were \"too many\" young people not in work, education or training. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March.Analysis: Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political argumentsThe Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs. \"There's a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and there's a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable,\" she added.Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits.Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the Covid pandemic.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%.\nThis is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes. \nTrump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars.\nChina's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (\u00a3788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn).\nIt has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s. \nSo how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success?\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nMost tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them.\nSo, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.\nIncreasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth.\nTrump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers.\nTrump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US. \nHe also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.\nYes, analysts say. \nExports have been the \"saving grace\" of China's economy and if the taxes linger,  exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC. \nThe sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus. \n\"The tariffs will hurt China,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. \"They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand.\"\nThat is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs. \nChinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption.\nWhile tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.\n\"Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,\" Ms Garcia-Herrero said.\nChina had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such  as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an \"early mover\" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy.\nChinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered.\n\"It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple.\"\nChina has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.\nAnd it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google.\nChina has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs.         \nAnd yet, Trump's recent  tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because  Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said.\n\"Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,\" she said.\nWhat concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips. \nThese restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West.  \nIt's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones.  \nAlthough this could \"impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power,\" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said.\nOn the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will  boost its high-value exports. \nIt happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say.\n\"The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,\" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC.\nThe government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar.   \nA shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.\nChina already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world. \n\"The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force,\" said Mr Cruise of Moody's.\nBut that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020.\nAnalysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico. \nChinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other.

        "article_text": "Rami Qattoush's mother beams with pride, as her nine-year-old son tentatively kicks a football for the first time since his injury.\nIt is a huge milestone in his recovery, since he travelled to Jordan last month after getting Israeli military approval to leave Gaza.\nRami dreams of playing football one day, like Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is still in pain and quickly tires, having to sit down on a plastic chair, exhausted from the effort.\nHis bandaged legs - one of them splinted - are badly scarred and withered.\nEvery step forward is hard.\nDoctors in Gaza had urged the family to agree to have both of his legs amputated. But his eight-year-old brother, Abdul Salam, had already lost his lower right leg due to his injuries and their mother, Islam, begged the surgeons to save Rami's limbs.\nWarning - This article contains distressing content\nThe boys had been fast asleep in the family's third-floor flat in Maghazi in central Gaza when, their mother says, an Israeli air strike targeted the building next door, raining rubble and shrapnel on the children.\nRami's 12-year-old brother, Mustafa, was killed, his body blown to pieces.\nHis heart, pierced with shrapnel, was only found two days later, Islam says. The family gave it a separate burial.\nThe UN says at least 14,500 children are reported to have been killed and many more badly wounded in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people. \nMedical evacuations from Gaza are critical, it says, because the healthcare system there has been devastated. Only 20 of the territory's 35 hospitals are partially functional and there are shortages of essential medicines and equipment.\nAn estimated 30,000 Gazans \u2013 like Rami and Abdul Salam \u2013 have been left with life-changing injuries which will require years of rehabilitation, according to the World Health Organization. \nIt has helped facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of patients since 1 February when the Rafah crossing with Egypt reopened for them. But it says that between 12,000 and 14,000 people \u2013 among them 4,500 children \u2013 still need to be brought out for treatment.\n\"The war has exacted a horrific toll on Gaza's children,\" the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) said when a ceasefire deal was announced in January.\nRami endured several surgical procedures without painkillers, anaesthesia or antibiotics, his mother told the BBC. His wounds became so infected that they were crawling with maggots. Doctors did not think his legs could be saved.\n\"Rami was in such pain, he was screaming 'God, you've taken my brother, now take me too!'\" Islam says.\nAnd then, in January, a rare chance came up - for Rami and his mother to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment at a specialised hospital for reconstructive surgery, run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Jordan's capital, Amman.\nIt is currently treating 13 children from Gaza, but has the capacity to take in dozens more.\n\"It's the only hospital I know of providing physical and mental rehabilitation for victims of war,\" says Marc Schakal, MSF programme manager for Jordan, Syria and Yemen. \"It's multi-disciplinary care, not just surgery.\"\nRami has a psychologist, surgeon and physiotherapist. He is also being fed, clothed, and taught at MSF's small \"School of the Future\", a bright prefabricated building in the grounds of the hospital. After missing so much education, he is a keen learner.\nBut he has also been missing his father Mohammed and his brother, Abdul Salam - who needs a prosthetic leg but wasn't able to leave Gaza with him.\nThey're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can.\n\"Gaza is beautiful,\" Rami told me. \"In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped.\"\nWith the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress.\n\"He arrived in a wheelchair,\" says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again. \n\"He's very motivated. He wants to get back to his friends and his family. He wants to make his dad proud.\"\nHe also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza.\nBut many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home.\nNot knowing if they will be allowed back into Gaza is another huge stress for all of the Palestinian patients on top of their trauma, according to psychologist Zainoun al-Sunna. \nSharing a hospital room with Rami is a withdrawn and traumatized five-year-old boy, Abdul Rahman al-Madhoun, who also needs surgery on his legs.\nHe was in his mother's arms when she was killed in an air strike in October 2023, along with his siblings.

And players will not have to repay the money if they later choose not to return to the sport.Grants will also be made available for fertility treatment.The maternity programme will be fully funded by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is a global partner of the WTA Tour. \"Players will have to compete in a minimum of eight WTA events in the previous 12 months (or a minimum of 24 in the previous 36 months) to be eligible.Raducanu to start trial with coach PlatenikPublished1 day agoBritain face Poland in Davis Cup relegation play-offPublished23 hours agoIndian Wells loss 'worst match I've ever played' - OsakaPublished1 day agoReturning to the tour after maternity leave has become easier since the WTA changed the rules before the 2019 season.New mothers are now be able to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over a three-year period from the birth of their child.Since 2019, returning mothers with a special ranking high enough to be seeded have also had a guarantee they will not face a seeded player in the opening round of their first eight tournaments.A seeding allows tournaments to ensure the world's best players do not meet in the early stages of competitions and instead play lower-ranked players in the opening rounds.The WTA says 50 players have benefitted from the special ranking since it was introduced six years ago.The WTA also offers access to a health team and taskforce, which includes physical assessments, mental health support and guidance on a staged return to play for new mothers and pregnant players.Related topicsTennis Petra Kvitova and Belinda Bencic have both made their comeback from maternity leave in recent months.Former world number one Victoria Azarenka, who gave birth to son Leo in 2016, told the BBC last year that it would be a \"huge win for women in general\" if the WTA was to introduce maternity pay.Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka also spoke in support of maternity pay, saying it would be \"life-changing\". \"In women's professional sports, particularly sports where athletes are self-employed, this has never been something that has been provided.",

        "article_text": "China has set an economic growth target for this year of \"around 5%\" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.\nIts leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.\nBut the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most.\nPresident Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.\nThis follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports. \nBeijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans.\nAt the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the \"main engine and anchor\" of its economic growth.\nBeijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus. \nRepeating that is going to be much harder this year. \n\"If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics. \nBeijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges. \nOn Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to \"vigorously boost\" household demand.\n\"Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough.\"\n\"Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,\" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world.\nBeijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices. \nThe government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment.\nBeijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; \u00a3140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual \"Work Report\". \nIn a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades.\nThe hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline. \nIt also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year.\nThe government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population.\nWhether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question.\nHarsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.   \nBut China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was \"important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant\".\nInvestment in what President Xi calls \"high-quality development\", which covers high-tech industries from renewables to artificial intelligence (AI), is also expected to be a major focus.\nThe world's second-largest economy, China has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West.\nState media has already touted recent examples like DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics, both of which have caught global attention, as examples of China's \"technological progress\". \nThe success of DeepSeek in particular saw an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors. \nA commentary in the state-run Xinhua newspaper said \"China's new energy industries and overall green transition, driven by its cutting-edge technologies, will continue to be important growth drivers\". \nBut the new US levies - which come on top of tariffs from Trump's first term - could  stymie these plans, not least because they could dampen investor sentiment.\n\"The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment,\" Mr Murphy Cruise says. \"Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment.\"\nAlso on Wednesday, China announced a 7.2% increase in its national defence budget, the same rate of growth as last year.\nAdditional reporting by Jo\u00e3o da Silva",

        "article_text": "In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.\nHe returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.\nBBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims. \nTrump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.\nThis is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.\nOn rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".\nInflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.\nThe 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.\nInflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.\nTrump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".\nPrices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.\nEgg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.\nThe USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (\u00a3780m) plan to help combat the issue.\nThe outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it. \nThe Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.\nTrump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.\nNo evidence has been provided for this figure.\nOn its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\nHowever, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.\nUS media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.\nSpeaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".\nThis is true.\nIn February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.\nThis is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.\nBy comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden. \nNumbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.\nContinuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".\nThere is no evidence for a figure this high.\nEncounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.\nIt is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.\nA report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.\nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.\nOn US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: \"We've spent perhaps $350bn\u2026 and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is.\"\nBBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included.\nThe US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.\nIt calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn.\nThe US Department of Defense has a higher figure of $182.8bn - taking into account a broader range of US military activity in Europe - but this is still considerably less than Trump's figure.\nWe have asked the White House where it comes from.\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.\nAdditional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.\nMr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive. \n\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.\nHe also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.\n\nDespite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.\nBut Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.\n\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.\nMadeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.\n\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.\nThis explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.\nMs Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.\nIn a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills. \n\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.\nAdditional reporting by Justin Rowlatt.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "Lampedusa's mid-20th-Century novel The Leopard became a bestseller, then a revered film \u2013 and is now a lavish Netflix series. Its withering takedown of society's flaws and hypocrisies still hits home today.\n\"Dying for somebody or for something, that was perfectly normal, of course: but the person dying should know, or at least feel sure, that someone knows for whom or for what he is dying.\" These are some of the opening lines of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's The Leopard, published in 1958, only a year after the author died of cancer.\nThese words are from the novel's protagonist, Prince Fabrizio, head of an aristocratic Sicilian family. He is recalling discovering the body of an unknown soldier under one of his paradisiacal villa's lemon trees. It's an image that sums up the novel's existential spirit: beneath beauty, there is rot.\nLampedusa was never published during his lifetime. His sole novel charts the fortunes of the Salina family, set against the backdrop of the Risorgimento: a social and political movement for Italian unification that led to the creation of a new kingdom of Italy in 1861, during a period of wider European revolutions. As ideas about democracy, liberalism and socialism carried throughout the continent, workers raged against the land-owning gentry, which they held responsible for worsening working conditions and widespread poverty. The period concluded in 1870 with the annexation of parts of the Italian peninsula, the unification of Italy and the capture of Rome.\nIn The Leopard, one such landowner, Fabrizio, strategises based on what he believes he stands to gain at this tumultuous time for the aristocracy. He orchestrates the marriage between his dashing nephew Tancredi Falconeri and the nouveau-riche Angelica Sedara \u2013 against the wishes of Fabrizio's own daughter Concetta, who is in love with Tancredi.\nConsidered one of the most important works of Italian literature, The Leopard was described by the cultural historian Lucy Hughes-Hallett as \"the most loved and admired novel ever written in Italian\". The British author EM Forster, meanwhile, in his preface to the Italian author's unfinished memoir Places of My Infancy (1971), wrote: \"Lampedusa has meant so much to me that I find it impossible to present him formally\u2026 Reading and rereading it has made me realise how many ways there are of being alive.\" Marking only the second adaptation of the novel \u2013 and the first serialised version \u2013 a new Netflix series makes a fresh case for The Leopard's relevance in the 21st Century, more than 60 years after Luchino Visconti's classic film.\nDespite its historical shrewdness and epic love story, Lampedusa's novel did not initially fare well with Italian publishers. Two major publishing houses, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore and Einaudi, swiftly rejected Lampedusa's 1956 manuscript. The influential modernist and editor Elio Vittorini claimed it was too \"traditional\" compared with the experimental avant-garde movement sweeping Italian literature at the time. \"Conservatives didn't like it because it's very rude about the Church and it's fairly cynical about aristocrats,\" David Laven, a historical consultant on Netflix's adaptation, tells the BBC. \"Left-wingers didn't like it because he doesn't portray a positive view of the ordinary working class.\"\nAfter Lampedusa's death, his book fell into the hands of literary agent Elena Croce and eventually landed on the desk of the publisher Feltrinelli. The novel had vocal detractors, including the aforementioned Vittorini and the anti-fascist author Alberto Moravia, who were both suspicious of what they believed was the novel's conservatism, a decade after the 1943 overthrowing of the fascist leader Benito Mussolini. As Rachel Donadio wrote in The New York Times in 2008, The Leopard \"was at first seen as quaint and reactionary, a baroque throwback at the height of neorealism in cinema and class-consciousness in all the arts\".\nWhen it was published, however, it became a runaway bestseller, cycling through a staggering 52 editions in fewer than six months. Perhaps it resonated with a disillusioned generation living well after the Risorgimento, but appreciating what the French Marxist author Louis Aragon described as a \"merciless\" and \"left-wing\" critique of the upper classes. Lampedusa was posthumously awarded the prestigious Strega Prize, and his reputation as a literary great would soon outstrip his contemporaries.\nPart of what made The Leopard difficult to stomach for so many was its scathing tone, evenly applied to all corners of Italian society. Lampedusa himself was born into the aristocracy in 1896, and lived in a grand palazzo much like the one in his novel \u2013 but that did not prevent him from lampooning his own. His biographer David Gilmour wrote in The Last Leopard (1988) that part of what prevented Lampedusa from writing until so late in life was what he believed to be the redundancy of his own class.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 10 of the best TV shows to watch this March\n\u2022 The mystery of why Jane Austen's letters were destroyed\n\u2022 The women-only gang that menaced Victorian London\nWithin the novel's first few pages, Lampedusa disdains Fabrizio's wife and seven children and describes his arduous audiences with King Francis I (King of the Two Sicilies) as coming face to face with: \"this monarchy which bore the marks of death upon its face\". Far from believing this makes him a cut above the rest, however, the jaded Fabrizio is just as flawed: unscrupulous, forsaking his own family. A tale of disenchantment and fear of obsolescence amid a crumbling dynasty, The Leopard skewers the flaws and hypocrisies present throughout all Italian society.\n\"The great myth of Italian unification is that it was a bottom-up movement, that Italians suddenly woke up in the morning and really wanted to overthrow the regimes they were living in,\" says Laven. \"If you think about Sicily, civilians were used to regime change.\"\u00a0Sicily had been ruled by the Spanish kings, the House of Savoy, the Austrian Habsburgs and eventually the Spanish Bourbons. The Spanish Bourbons had taken over by the time Naples and Sicily were merged in 1816, following the Napoleonic Wars. They were, in turn, overthrown in 1848, before returning to power 16 months later.\nIn Lampedusa's novel, though the revolutionaries have high hopes of radical change, the protagonist insists the middle classes will simply replace the upper classes, while on the face of things everything remains the same. Despite these societal shifts, the status quo was upheld, as captured by one of the novel's most enduring lines: \"If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.\"\n\"It's not only something that's going on in Italy but across Europe in the 19th Century,\" says Laven. \"Bismarck doesn't really want German unification. He's trying to defend the interests of the Prussian Junkers [nobility], and he's prepared to make compromises. Lots of British aristocrats don't like the way the world is going, but they realise they must accommodate themselves with a changing world in order to retain their status. [The Leopard] tells us something about the way in which elites seek to retain their power.\"\nAccording to Laven, although The Leopard contains small historical inaccuracies, Lampedusa really captured the essence of the time. Unlike the work of historical fiction giants such as Leo Tolstoy or Victor Hugo, the author navigates Fabrizio's lofty world with thrift and virtuosic wit. \"[When you think of historical fiction], you tend to think of these great slabs of books,\" says Laven. \"What you have [here] \u00a0is this incredible ability to capture a moment almost 100 years before he's writing with such economy of style.\"\nFive years after publication, The Leopard's status as a landmark of Italian literature was cemented by an acclaimed film adaptation, directed by Visconti, a Marxist who, like Lampedusa, hailed from a noble family. It starred Burt Lancaster as the titular leopard, Fabrizio, and Alain Delon as his nephew Tancredi. Visconti's opulent film held the same searingly cynical and yet elegiac view on the upper echelons of Italian society, according to Arabella Cifani, books editor of the Giornale dell'Arte. \"Visconti understood it profoundly,\" she tells the BBC. \"One would say that the book was connatural to the worldview held by Visconti, who was also a prince and whose ancestors had ruled Milan for over 100 years.\"\nFamously, the film contains a lavish 25-minute ballroom scene. According to the Rotten Tomatoes' critics consensus, the waltz \"competes for [the] most beautiful sequence committed to film\". But amid this splendour, Lancaster's Fabrizio has a cloying sense of his own mortality, musing on what his own death will be like. The American star was not Visconti's first choice for the role, but he embarked on in-depth research, spending time with Lampedusa's widow, adopted son and members of the Sicilian nobility. Though it won the Palme d'Or in its year of release (1963), the critic David Weir claimed Visconti's film was less appreciated by audiences than Federico Fellini's 8 \u00bd from the same year: \"The Leopard\u00a0was part of the story of the early 1960s that saw movie audiences gravitating away from big-budget fiascos\". Its ensuing influence on major directors has been undeniable, however, with resonances of it in the grandiose work of Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese, who has cited it as one of his favourite films, saying: \"I live with this movie every day of my life\".\nFor the creators of Netflix's new series, the way The Leopard speaks to a collapsing epoch was at the core of its appeal. \"We were going through the throes of Brexit when I first read it, and it seemed to me that there was a sort of Risorgimento in reverse happening,\" its writer and creator Richard Warlow tells the BBC, referring to new divisions being created in Europe as opposed to unifications. \"It did get me thinking about ideas of nationhood, what it is to be an island, the ingrained nature of our lives and what it's like to suddenly change that.\" Undoubtedly, the lavishness of the novel was another draw for the showrunners, with some already comparing it to hugely successful Netflix series like The Crown or Bridgerton.\nAlthough the Risorgimento\u00a0\u2013 and the novel's events \u2013 took place more than 150 years ago, the ramifications are still deeply felt in Italian society, according to Laven, especially against an increasingly political and economic split between north and south. \"It's quite clear that for them it's still very meaningful,\" he says. And how much this revolutionary period of history changed anything\u00a0\u2013 besides the creation of a centrally governed region of Italy\u00a0\u2013 is open to debate. Cifani adds that the novel's famous line: \"if we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change\" continues to be used as a political slogan. It's a sentiment that seems, like Lampedusa's novel, timeless.\nThe Leopard is released on Netflix on 5 March.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

We're ready in case we need extra time and penalties because I know how difficult it is in each match.\n\"The players, I'm sure they have experiences before as well with matches like that and we have to respect the opponent always.\n\"They won against Atalanta 3-1 [in the knockout-round play-offs] and they compete very well.\n\"We need to watch the match again with the players to understand the difficulties we can face against teams in Europe.\n\"I am happy but calm, getting balance.\"\nAston Villa scored more goals in this match (three) than they had in their previous five meetings with Belgian sides in all competitions combined (two)",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nNo-one can predict the score - Arteta\nEindhoven has been packed with carnival-goers in recent days but on Tuesday it was Arsenal enjoying their own party in the city, getting over their goalscoring crisis and setting a Champions League record in the process.\nMikel Arteta's side became the first team in Champions League history to score seven goals away from home in the knockout stages of the competition as they romped to a 7-1 win over PSV Eindhoven.\nIt was the most goals the Gunners have scored in a single game since beating Newcastle 7-3 in the Premier League 13 years ago.\nThe Arsenal manager said the win had given his players \"joy and confidence and belief\", but was not getting carried away when questions were put to him about the records that his team had broken.\n\"For sure, it's something that hasn't been done, so great to be part of that,\" Arteta said. \"But as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that.\n\"The happiest thing is we are in a very strong position to go to the next round, which is where we want to be.\n\"But there's still a job to do in London in a week's time.\"\nAfter failing to score in their past two games, a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest and 1-0 defeat by West Ham, Arteta may not have seen a victory like this coming. \n\"This will give them great confidence for the rest of the season. Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDevastating Arsenal can win Champions League - Sutton\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too. He took it well  and we're all there to support and I'm sure he will learn from that too.\"\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has issued what he called a \"last warning\" to Hamas to release the hostages being held in Gaza.\n\"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say,\" Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform.\nIt comes just hours after the White House confirmed it is holding direct talks with Hamas over the hostages.\nWashington has until now avoided direct engagement with the group, and there is a longstanding US policy against having direct contact with entities it lists as terrorist organisations.\nIn his social media post, Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\" if the hostages were not released, while not specifying the nature of the support he was sending Israel.\n\"Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" he added.\n\"For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance.\"\nHe also appeared to threaten civilians: \"Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!\"\nIt's not the first time Trump has threatened Hamas. In December, he said there would be \"all hell to pay\" if hostages were not released by the time he took office.\nThe post came after Trump met with a group of hostages in the White House who had been recently released under the ceasefire.\nMeanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the US has been negotiating directly with Hamas to try to secure the release of the hostages.\nIsrael had been consulted prior to the talks, she added.\nPresident Trump believed in doing what was in the best interest of the American people, Leavitt told reporters.\nThe special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler's work was a \"good faith effort to do what's right for the American people\", she added.\n\"Two direct meetings\" have taken place between Hamas and a US official, \"preceded by several communications\", a Palestinian source told the BBC.\nIsrael said there are still 59 hostages being held in Gaza, with up to 24 believed to be alive. US citizens are also among the captives.\nNews of the talks was first reported by Axios, which said the two sides were meeting in Qatar to discuss the release of US hostages as well as a wider deal to end the war.\nA former US deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for the Middle East said the US needs to be \"more proactive\" about getting its citizens back.\nMick Mulroy, who is also an ex-CIA paramilitary officer, added that \"it could complicate the Israelis' ability to get their citizens back if not tightly coordinated\".\nIsrael's prime minister's office said in a statement it has \"expressed its position\" regarding the direct talks, but did not provide any further information.\nAccording to reports, Boehler met with Hamas representatives in the Qatari capital, Doha, in recent weeks.\nHamas has had a base in Doha since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration.\nThe small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region.

Osborne, 23, has played on the wing for Leinster, but this will be his first time in the position at Test level.\nRonan Kelleher (neck) remains sidelined, so Rob Herring is set to make his first appearance of the tournament as replacement hooker with Dan Sheehan starting.\nGarry Ringrose's suspension means Bundee Aki returns to partner Robbie Henshaw in midfield, the latter switching to outside centre. \nFinlay Bealham returns at tight-head prop and Thomas Clarkson drops to the bench. Tadhg Furlong is still ruled out despite stepping up his rehabilitation from calf and hamstring injuries.\nLike Doris, Bealham and Jack Conan are set to win their 50th caps.

Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

        "article_text": "In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.\nHe returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.\nBBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims. \nTrump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.\nThis is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.\nOn rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".\nInflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.\nThe 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.\nInflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.\nTrump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".\nPrices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.\nEgg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.\nThe USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (\u00a3780m) plan to help combat the issue.\nThe outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it. \nThe Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.\nTrump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.\nNo evidence has been provided for this figure.\nOn its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\nHowever, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.\nUS media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.\nSpeaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".\nThis is true.\nIn February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.\nThis is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.\nBy comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden. \nNumbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.\nContinuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".\nThere is no evidence for a figure this high.\nEncounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.\nIt is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.\nA report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.\nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.\nOn US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: \"We've spent perhaps $350bn\u2026 and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is.\"\nBBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included.\nThe US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.\nIt calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn.\nThe US Department of Defense has a higher figure of $182.8bn - taking into account a broader range of US military activity in Europe - but this is still considerably less than Trump's figure.\nWe have asked the White House where it comes from.\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.\nAdditional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

I'm only playing by the rules,\" Gallagher said.\nBut an official from promoter Boxxer directed the weigh-in to continue, before Wales' Price weighed in at 10st 5lb - two pounds under the welterweight limit.\nLiverpool's WBA and IBF champion Jonas then tipped the scales at 10st 6lb. \n\"Isn't boxing full of dramas? I was light, with my clothes on,\" Jonas, 40, said.\nPrice, 30, won Olympic gold at Tokyo 2020 and is unbeaten in eight pro fights.\n\"Gallagher is trying to make it about himself but it's Jonas v Price,\" she said.\nThe event ended with a cordial handshake between the two champions, who will headline the all-female card at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n'I want to be the best in the sport' - Price\n'Chin up, kid, it all works out in the end' - Jonas' 'sliding doors' moments\nJonas v Price - all you need to know\nThis video can not be played\nCancer diagnosis still doesn't feel real - Gallagher\nOnce again, Gallagher stole the show and deflected attention away from his fighter - perhaps to ease any pressure on two-weight champion Jonas.\n\"They're not calibrated scales. I've got the certificate, the sticker is up there on the screen, they were calibrated on 9 January,\" he told Sky Sports after the weigh-in.\n\"People saying I am kicking off again, but we're talking about a world title event. Can you imagine, hypothetically, [Manny] Pacquaio or [Floyd] Mayweather fight and they're not calibrated scales?\"\nOn Wednesday, Gallagher had fired back at Team Price and questioned why his fighter was considered the underdog.\nAfter the weigh-in, Jonas - who has won 16 professional fights, lost two and drawn one - paid tribute to Gallagher's \"tenacity, devotion and dedication\".\nThe 56-year-old revealed earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with stage four bowel and liver cancer.\n\"He might have his moments but right now he is still soldiering on,\" Jonas said.\n\"One of the things we do as a boxer is masking our emotions and he's probably doing a lot of that.\"\nThis video can not be played\nJonas v Price: Welterweight world champions face off\nPrice, who has cruised through the paid ranks and won a world title in just her seventh bout, refuted any suggestion from Team Jonas that she may have found it difficult to make the welterweight limit.\n\"I don't crash the weight, it's my natural weight,\" she said.\n\"I'm in my prime, it's my time and I'm ready. I'll be taking those belts back to Wales.\"\nA victory over Jonas would lift Price's career to new heights.\nThe Welshwoman is targeting the winner of WBO champion Mikaela Mayer v Sandy Ryan - who fight later this month - in an undisputed title bout by the end of 2025. \nEarlier, a fired-up Caroline Dubois and South Korea's Bo Mi Re Shin both weighed in at 9st 7lb for their lightweight world-title contest.\nLondoner Dubois, 25, smiled and flexed her muscles before the two women gently leaned in with their heads for the face-off.\n\"We're going to let our fists do the talking. These are my belts and this is the closest she is going to get to them,\" Dubois - draped in the WBC and IBO belts - said.\nOlympic bronze medallist Cindy Ngamba was not present at the weigh-in, however, after she was withdrawn from her pro debut on medical grounds on Thursday morning. \nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

What was that?\"\nWilliams repeated his question and McManus, from Glasgow, can be heard starting to cry.\n\"Is this a joke?\" she said. \"For goodness sake, yes!\"\n\"Let's do it,\" said Williams. \"We'll sort out what song later.\"\nThe singer is set to perform some of his most popular songs on tour including Angels and She's the One, as well as new songs from his recent biopic.\nHe has previously performed duets with the likes of Kylie Minogue, Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift.\nBetter Man tells the story of Robbie Williams and his rise to fame - but he is portrayed by an anthropomorphic chimpanzee. \nThe film was released in December and depicts the early days of Take That as well as his struggles with drug addiction and mental health.\nMcManus told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that she assumed Williams was going to ask her for food recommendations in Edinburgh.\n\"At no point ever in my wildest dreams did I think he was about to ask me what he did,\" she said.\n\"I cried a lot after it happened. It's the enormity of being onstage in Murrayfield in front of about 70,000 people with Robbie Williams.\n\"But it's also the magnitude of the kindness. Robbie has been so incredibly kind to me on so many different occasions even though he's such a megastar.\"\nMcManus said she got to know Williams in the early 2000s after she won Pop Idol.\n\"Robbie had just done Knebworth and he was absolutely huge with a solo career,\" she said.\n\"He was getting a lot of really horrible stuff written about him in the press. As soon as Pop Idol came along, I got a lot of that as well.\n\"It was so intense at the time about how unattractive I was, about how overweight I was. He was a huge fan of reality TV and noticed that we were both getting a lot of column inches.\"\nMcManus said Williams reached out to her after her time on Pop Idol with some advice on dealing with the negativity.\nShe added: \"I cried a lot with him at the time and it never left me because he gave me some great advice and it really helped me get through that initial period.\"\nWhen asked what she would like to sing with him, McManus said: \"That man could hand me the phone book and I'd sing it for him, I don't care because it's Robbie Williams.\n\"Obviously I want to Lulu it right up - but I don't think he'll do Relight My Fire because why would he? With the back catalogue that man's got, I'm not going to ask him to whip out a Take That number.\n\"I'll give it my best shot. He knows I'm a big belter.\"\nShe told BBC Scotland that it was especially meaningful to sing in front of a Scottish crowd with someone who has been \"really important to me throughout all of my career\".\nIn 2014, McManus was invited to sing with Rod Stewart at the Hydro in Glasgow to celebrate 50 years of the Lisbon Lions - the Celtic team that won the European Cup in Portugal in 1967.\nShe also performed alongside Susan Boyle for Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to Glasgow in 2010.\nBut she added: \"To get to this point 22 years after I won the competition, this is probably the biggest thing I've been asked to do. \n\"I'm still in shock. My heart is bursting.\"",

        "article_text": "Paris St-Germain last reached the Champions League final in 2020\nRarely in the past decade and a half of Qatari ownership have Paris St-Germain entered the spring with this kind of confidence.\nOn Saturday evening, the runaway Ligue 1 leaders wasted little time in dismantling a Lille side who also had a midweek Champions League tie to look forward to, scoring four goals in what manager Luis Enrique would later call the team's \"best half of the season\".\nVictory against Les Dogues, who could only muster a consolation goal through Jonathan David 10 minutes from time, was more than simply a dress rehearsal before Liverpool's visit to the French capital on Wednesday for the first leg of their last-16 tie.\nLille, who have notably beaten both Real and Atletico Madrid in Europe this season, were swept aside as PSG continued their seemingly inevitable march towards completing an unbeaten campaign on home soil.\nThe all-conquering form of a rejuvenated PSG would have seemed unlikely at the start of the season.\nWhile the post-Kylian Mbappe era arguably started midway through last season, given that the France captain was mostly spared for high-profile matches at that point, replacing his output and leading role remained the major uncertainty on the eve of the new campaign.\nThat task was made all the more pressing by the absence of a centre-forward in name during most of the autumn.\nPortuguese international Goncalo Ramos was sidelined for three months with an ankle injury, while Randal Kolo Muani was progressively phased out of the team, eventually culminating in his loan move to Juventus this winter.\nInitially, it was Bradley Barcola, from the left wing, who took up the mantle by scoring 10 times in the first 11 league games of the campaign.\nHaving carried over his goalscoring form to international duty amid Mbappe's absence from Les Bleus, the 22-year-old was looking increasingly at ease in carrying the now-Real Madrid man's responsibilities for club and country.\nHis form only faintly translated to Champions League fixtures, though, as was the case for the rest of the team. Successive false-nine experiments, notably involving Kang-in Lee and Ousmane Dembele, were proving mostly ineffective as the team registered just one win in the first five European matchdays.\nThe team's league stage campaign, branded by Enrique \"unjust\" given the tough draw they faced, was stunted by an inability to capitalise on their dominance in possession in most matches.\nA disastrous early exit in January was an increasingly credible prospect, until the pieces of the Spaniard's plan finally began to fall into place.\nThe Parisians' free-scoring run since January has included 18 goals in four European encounters, a figure admittedly inflated by Brest's unfortunate collapse in their play-off tie.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nOusmane Dembele has the highest amount of goal involvements in Ligue 1 this season\nLeading the reversal in fortunes has been Dembele's newly found confidence in front of goal, with the 27-year-old finally realising the potential of his talent.\nThe France international, despite arguably being the face of the club with Mbappe gone, has scarcely been given any kind of preferential treatment.\nHis reinvention has been all the more unlikely given what was an ostensibly fraught rapport with his manager only a few months ago.\nHe was notably dropped for the trip to face Arsenal in October, for arriving late to training, a move which Enrique later branded more recently as \"the best thing I've done to him\".\nAfter a needless sending off in the defeat by Bayern Munich, Dembele was again relegated to the bench for the following league games.\nTensions were eventually appeased, though, as the former Barcelona player worked his way back into the team and claimed the unlikely false-nine role as his own.\nWith 18 goals across all competitions since the turn of the year, the 27-year-old has scored more in two months than any single season of his to date.\nWhile his talent has seldom been called into question, Dembele has, virtually overnight, managed to erase the erratic decision-making, which plagued the first decade of his career.\n\"It's a bit of everything. It's down to my positioning, but also a change in mentality,\" the forward told the Ligue 1 broadcaster on Saturday night.\nDembele's purple patch has also been aided by the team of young talents around him suddenly clicking into gear.\nThe pivot away from buying established names hasn't necessarily meant a decrease in activity in the transfer window, though.\nLast summer's arrivals of teenagers Joao Neves and Doue, along with Ecuadorian centre-back Willian Pacho, did not come cheap, and Kvaratskhelia's signing from Napoli cost the Parisians a reported 70m euros (\u00a358m).\nLuis Enrique extended his contract as Paris St-Germain head coach until 2027\nGone are the \"clans\" that divided past PSG squads, with Enrique now able to mould a team of young (and evidently willing) talents around his philosophy.\nOf those who started in last weekend's hard-fought win in Lyon, only the 30-year-old Marquinhos was older than 26. Impressively, virtually all of the new arrivals from abroad have had little issue giving post-match interviews in French.\nFew in the team encapsulate the willingness to integrate and adapt according to the team's needs better than Neves. The creative-minded midfielder, while standing out as part of a three-man block alongside the equally impressive Vitinha, has filled in more than serviceably at both right-back and left-back when called upon.\nThe Benfica academy product, who has set up nine goals in all competitions this season, has displayed a technical ease in slicing through defences and evading pressure only rivalled by his compatriot.\nHis assist for Dembele against Lille, setting up the Frenchman despite finding himself virtually face-to-face with goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, was emblematic of his selfless, all-action displays since arriving.\nNot all of the summer recruits hit the ground running straight away. French youth international Doue had already established himself as one of the continent's most promising talents even before joining from Rennes this summer, but a limited impact in his first few months in the capital drew increasing criticism over the necessity of his costly arrival.\nAn impressive display against Salzburg in December, though, was the catalyst for Doue's increased involvement and upturn in form.\nThe 19-year-old was key in three of PSG's four goals against Lille on Saturday, adding his name onto the scoresheet with a strike into the top corner.\nAt ease both on the wing and further back in midfield, Doue has bounced back from an uncertain start to life in the capital.\nBarcola has also bounced back from a dip in form during the winter months, perhaps aided by the fact that the goalscoring burden is now shared across the frontline.\nKhvicha Kvaratskhelia is the first Georgian player to score in the knockout stages of the Champions League\nThe arrival of fierce competition in Kvaratskhelia in January also appears to have kick-started his output again, with his tally now standing at 17 goals and 11 assists this term.\nSitting behind the team's impressive firepower, though, is also a defence with new-found assurance. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, for instance, has appeared increasingly reliable and comfortable with the ball at his feet, far from the high-profile errors of past European campaigns.\nBarring some rare lapses in concentration, the 23-year-old Pacho has adapted seamlessly to the physically demanding nature of Ligue 1 after joining from Eintracht Frankfurt.\nHis composure and workrate in particular have complemented captain Marquinhos more effectively than the more experienced centre-backs PSG have signed over the past few years.\nHaving mostly seen off domestic opposition since their upturn in form, Wednesday night's game against Premier League leaders LIverpool will be the sternest test yet.\n\"It could have been a Champions League final,\" as the PSG manager noted on Saturday.\nThe Asturian is right to view the tie as a clash of equals.",

        "summary": "PSG's post-Mbappe era, no 'clans' and foreign stars' French buy-inImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Paris St-Germain last reached the Champions League final in 2020Raphael JucobinBBC Sport in ParisPublished5 hours agoRarely in the past decade and a half of Qatari ownership have Paris St-Germain entered the spring with this kind of confidence.On Saturday evening, the runaway Ligue 1 leaders wasted little time in dismantling a Lille side who also had a midweek Champions League tie to look forward to, scoring four goals in what manager Luis Enrique would later call the team's \"best half of the season\".Victory against Les Dogues, who could only muster a consolation goal through Jonathan David 10 minutes from time, was more than simply a dress rehearsal before Liverpool's visit to the French capital on Wednesday for the first leg of their last-16 tie.Lille, who have notably beaten both Real and Atletico Madrid in Europe this season, were swept aside as PSG continued their seemingly inevitable march towards completing an unbeaten campaign on home soil.The all-conquering form of a rejuvenated PSG would have seemed unlikely at the start of the season.While the post-Kylian Mbappe era arguably started midway through last season, given that the France captain was mostly spared for high-profile matches at that point, replacing his output and leading role remained the major uncertainty on the eve of the new campaign.That task was made all the more pressing by the absence of a centre-forward in name during most of the autumn.Portuguese international Goncalo Ramos was sidelined for three months with an ankle injury, while Randal Kolo Muani was progressively phased out of the team, eventually culminating in his loan move to Juventus this winter.Initially, it was Bradley Barcola, from the left wing, who took up the mantle by scoring 10 times in the first 11 league games of the campaign.Having carried over his goalscoring form to international duty amid Mbappe's absence from Les Bleus, the 22-year-old was looking increasingly at ease in carrying the now-Real Madrid man's responsibilities for club and country.His form only faintly translated to Champions League fixtures, though, as was the case for the rest of the team. Successive false-nine experiments, notably involving Kang-in Lee and Ousmane Dembele, were proving mostly ineffective as the team registered just one win in the first five European matchdays.The team's league stage campaign, branded by Enrique \"unjust\" given the tough draw they faced, was stunted by an inability to capitalise on their dominance in possession in most matches.A disastrous early exit in January was an increasingly credible prospect, until the pieces of the Spaniard's plan finally began to fall into place.The Parisians' free-scoring run since January has included 18 goals in four European encounters, a figure admittedly inflated by Brest's unfortunate collapse in their play-off tie.Listen to the latest Football Daily podcastDembele emerges as PSG talismanImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ousmane Dembele has the highest amount of goal involvements in Ligue 1 this seasonLeading the reversal in fortunes has been Dembele's newly found confidence in front of goal, with the 27-year-old finally realising the potential of his talent.The France international, despite arguably being the face of the club with Mbappe gone, has scarcely been given any kind of preferential treatment.His reinvention has been all the more unlikely given what was an ostensibly fraught rapport with his manager only a few months ago.He was notably dropped for the trip to face Arsenal in October, for arriving late to training, a move which Enrique later branded more recently as \"the best thing I've done to him\".After a needless sending off in the defeat by Bayern Munich, Dembele was again relegated to the bench for the following league games.Tensions were eventually appeased, though, as the former Barcelona player worked his way back into the team and claimed the unlikely false-nine role as his own.With 18 goals across all competitions since the turn of the year, the 27-year-old has scored more in two months than any single season of his to date.While his talent has seldom been called into question, Dembele has, virtually overnight, managed to erase the erratic decision-making, which plagued the first decade of his career. French youth international Doue had already established himself as one of the continent's most promising talents even before joining from Rennes this summer, but a limited impact in his first few months in the capital drew increasing criticism over the necessity of his costly arrival.An impressive display against Salzburg in December, though, was the catalyst for Doue's increased involvement and upturn in form.The 19-year-old was key in three of PSG's four goals against Lille on Saturday, adding his name onto the scoresheet with a strike into the top corner.At ease both on the wing and further back in midfield, Doue has bounced back from an uncertain start to life in the capital.Barcola has also bounced back from a dip in form during the winter months, perhaps aided by the fact that the goalscoring burden is now shared across the frontline.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is the first Georgian player to score in the knockout stages of the Champions LeagueThe arrival of fierce competition in Kvaratskhelia in January also appears to have kick-started his output again, with his tally now standing at 17 goals and 11 assists this term.Sitting behind the team's impressive firepower, though, is also a defence with new-found assurance. It's down to my positioning, but also a change in mentality,\" the forward told the Ligue 1 broadcaster on Saturday night.Dembele's purple patch has also been aided by the team of young talents around him suddenly clicking into gear.The pivot away from buying established names hasn't necessarily meant a decrease in activity in the transfer window, though.Last summer's arrivals of teenagers Joao Neves and Doue, along with Ecuadorian centre-back Willian Pacho, did not come cheap, and Kvaratskhelia's signing from Napoli cost the Parisians a reported 70m euros (\u00a358m).Image source, EPAImage caption, Luis Enrique extended his contract as Paris St-Germain head coach until 2027Gone are the \"clans\" that divided past PSG squads, with Enrique now able to mould a team of young (and evidently willing) talents around his philosophy.Of those who started in last weekend's hard-fought win in Lyon, only the 30-year-old Marquinhos was older than 26. \"It's a bit of everything.",

        "article_text": "Are you warm, cool or neutral? How the retro trend of \"getting your colours done\" made a comeback with personalised colour analysis on social media \u2013 and how your perfect colours can \"spark careers, conversations and connections\".\nDo you have cool or medium undertones? Does red brighten your skin or dull you down?\u00a0Questions like these, that may not have crossed your mind before, are now prominent on social media, as users try to define their colour palettes.\u00a0Colour analysis, once considered niche, has seen a surge in popularity, with appointments booked months in advance and apps including TikTok and Instagram flooded with tutorials on how to determine which colours suit you.\u00a0\n\"Before I started offering online consultations, I had people fly in from around the world to see me,\" says Canadian image consultant and colour analyst Carol Brailey.\u00a0\nSince Brailey launched her business back in 2012, and has done thousands of consultations. \"It appeals to people from all walks of life,\" she tells the BBC. \"There's everyone from 17-year-olds to those in their 70s \u2013 I find people are tired of gravitating towards black clothing.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nOn TikTok, Brailey's client transformations have gained millions of views, as has the hashtag #ColorAnalysis, which is often accompanied by filters allowing users to find their palette. But although this technology is new, the practice has been around for decades.\u00a0\u00a0\nColour analysis enjoyed a spell of popularity in the 1980s and early-90s, when \"getting your colours done\" meant visiting a professional colour consultant in person, and being assigned a particular set of hues \u2013 often based on a system of seasons \u2013 that suited you. Broadly speaking, spring meant bright and fresh colours, summer cool and light, autumn was burnt oranges and mossy greens, and winter was deep jewel tones. This surge in interest was largely thanks to the bestselling books Color Me Beautiful by Carole Jackson (which sold more than 13 million copies worldwide) and Color Me a Season by Bernice Kentner.\nHowever, it was in the early-1900s that seasonal colour theory was born in the studio of Johannes Itten, a Swiss painter and art professor. Itten noticed that some of his students' portraits looked more vibrant than others, a difference he attributed to colour. By analysing colours that \"harmonised\" well together, he developed the seasonal analysis tool still used today, grouping people into summer, autumn, winter or spring.\u00a0\nBrailey puts the modern-day revival down to how visual we have become. \"Whether it's uploading Instagram pictures, recording TikTok content, or even Zoom meetings, we have become a very visual society.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter her consultations, it's not unusual to see tears, she says. \"People cry because they've never seen themselves look so vibrant. In my years of being in the industry, I have witnessed people's lives change, with promotions and new jobs, because it starts a confidence boost.\"\u00a0\nTabitha Lofts didn't cry after her colour consultation, but she did opt to have a total makeover, dyeing her hair, switching up her make-up routine, and introducing colours to her wardrobe that she hadn't previously worn.\u00a0\"I did the whole shebang\", she laughs, adding, \"I liked it, and I felt so different.\" Before her consultation, Tabitha thought she had a warm spring or summer palette, explaining, \"I was so sure that I was warm toned, because I burn in the Sun, but it was the complete opposite.\u00a0I learnt I'm cool toned, suit silver jewellery, and my favourite colours weren't my colours at all. Now I wear lots of cobalt blue, a shade I'd never worn before.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n- How one surprising image kick-started the 90s\n- How to transform your home with art\n- How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\nFor Lofts, who is a nutritionist and content creator, colour analysis was a way of building confidence.\u00a0\"I was quitting fake tan, as I was addicted, and relied on it to bring my outfits together,\" she says. \"It was confidence in a bottle, but I need to find it elsewhere.\" She described getting dressed and not \"understanding\" her skin tone, which is where she got the idea for the image consultation.\u00a0\"The results really changed my mind about my pale skin. I used to think about it with negative connotations and assumed it made me look icy, but now I know I can be warm, even without warm visuals.\"\u00a0\nTo those who are dismissive of colour analysis, Lofts admits it is not the be all and end all. \"Although I got a lot from it, I still wear colours that aren't in my palette. It's not a prescription.\"\u00a0\nGrowing up in Costa Rica, fashion designer and stylist Micah Lumsden has always gravitated towards bright colours, as she finds that wearing them lifts her mood. But it was an experience while at fashion school that made her want to better understand colour theory.\u00a0\"We were studying colour analysis, and my skin tone wasn't understood by my teachers. I got several back-up consultations from other students, but there were so many misconceptions about dark skin,\" she tells the BBC. \"Comments like, 'Every black person looks good in red,' as well as the idea that 'those with darker skin look good in every colour'.\"\u00a0\nIt was this lack of awareness that prompted Lumsden to launch styling consultancy Cocoa Styling. \"I started working with painters and make-up artists, the people who really understand colour theory.\"\u00a0She now has clients around the world, and has noticed more male clients on her books. \"Guys do care about fashion,\" she says. \"I used to see one man per 10 clients, but now it's one per five.\"\u00a0\nAs a stylist, she approaches wardrobes with colour at the forefront, rather than design. \"Most people will look good in a tailored blazer and T-shirt, but the personalisation of colour gives an outfit a special touch.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nColour analysis is often expensive, but Lumsden doesn't want that to be a deterrent. She's also sceptical of online colour-analysis filters being the answer. \"It's hard to give an unbiased reading of filters, and screens also reflect light.\"\nInstead, she suggests holding up items from around the home against your face, or going to a local craft store to buy felt patches. \"You can use blankets, cushions... whatever. Hold them up against your face in the mirror, and take a selfie. Once you've got a collection of selfies, place them next to each other and ask, do I look better with blue and purples? Or yellows and oranges? If it's the latter, you have a warm palette, if it's the former, you're probably cool.\"\u00a0\nWe know fashion runs in cycles, but many believe that knowing your personal palette could be a way to break up with fast fashion. \"Trends rotate so quickly, so knowing your best colours is a great way of harnessing what suits you and eliminating everything else,\" Ellie Richards tells the BBC. She's the founder of Nuude Studio in Queenstown, New Zealand, and approaches fashion through psychology. Colour, in her opinion, is the most important tool.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There is a science to clothes changing your mood, your behaviour and people's perception of you,\" she says. \"When you put on a colour that suits you, it's a powerful tool, because we're instantly more confident and aligned in personal identity.\"\u00a0\nThe easiest way to see colour psychology in action, she says, is in films and TV series. \"If we look at Euphoria, for example, Cassie (played by Sydney Sweeney) is often dressed in light blue to show an angel-like innocence, whereas Maddy (played by Alexa Demie) dresses in more dark maroon tones to signify her influence.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nLook at some of the trending colours of 2025, and black doesn't feature. Instead, we're seeing bold cardinal reds, striking marigolds and dusty-rose pinks. According to Richards, we've entered an era of being \"bold\".\u00a0\n\"The pandemic days of wearing grey sweats are over, and instead we've emerged seeking fun, playful looks.\" She cites social media as influencing our style, too. \"It's had a massive effect. On TikTok, creators need to stand out and they can do so by wearing bright, eye-catching colours. Those videos are seen by millions of people, and so it's normalised these bold looks.\"\nRichards is passionate about the benefits of colour analysis. \"A deep understanding of personal style and colour can spark careers, conversations and connections,\" she says, acknowledging that it can be a little daunting at first, but advising the curious to start by adding colour little by little.\u00a0\"One option is to wear muted shades of a colour, or accessories.\"\nDespite a colour consultation confirming that cobalt blue suits her best, Lofts still gravitates towards black. \"It's easy to wear,\" she says with a smile. \"But I'm trying to be more adventurous.\"\nAs a personal trainer, she sees plenty of online content pushing \"optimisation\" and \"being the best version of yourself\". She views colour analysis as part of that trend, but believes the most important thing is feeling comfortable in your own skin. \"Everyone is focused on self-improvement, and there's a vanity to it,\" she says. \"But it doesn't have to be serious. Experimenting with colour should be fun, playful, and free from judgement.\" She laughs. \"Even if you don't stick to your assigned palette.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Danny Dyer is back on the big screen with a film about a bloke trying to win back his missus.\nMarching Powder follows the story of Jack Jones (Dyer), a football hooligan who feels increasingly irrelevant.\nAfter some violent match day behaviour, Jack is arrested and given six weeks to turn his life around - or face prison. He also has to try to save his marriage.\nBut the real Danny Dyer met his partner when they were 13. They've been together more than 30 years, married for eight of them, and he likes to think he's a bit of a romantic.\nSo, what love lessons can we learn from the former EastEnders actor?\n\"I'm a snorer,\" Dyer admits.\n\"You know what, snoring is just bad luck. Me and my wife have been around a long time and we have separate beds and the reason for that is, I unfortunately roar in the night.\"\nThe 47-year-old says it's rare to have been with your partner for over 30 years at his age. \"We're bringing up grandchildren \u2013 it's a beautiful thing. My clan's getting bigger and I've become more responsible now.\n\"I feel like I've grown up slightly and become an adult.\"\n\"Listen, I think it's a bit of a myth that I've played the hard man role,\" Dyer says. \"In EastEnders, I played an alpha male that wore a pink dressing gown. I was a very sensitive soul.\"\nHe says if you look at the Marching Powder poster, it's easy to think he's playing a hard man - but his character, Jack, isn't. \"He's into football violence and he's got a lot of issues around addiction, but he's a good man.\n\"What is masculinity?\" Dyer wonders. \"When does it become toxic? It's about being a decent human being.\n\"There's nothing wrong with being masculine. But as men, we need to open up to each other and stand up to our mates and go, 'no, I'm not coming out tonight \u2013 I'm going to spend a nice evening with my wife'.\n\"Me and my wife are actually going to therapy, couples' help groups. And you know, your mates are all laughing but you go \u2013 no, no I love her.\"\nWhen it comes to his romantic playlist, Dyer loves the somewhat unlikely combo of Luther Vandross and Jeff Buckley. \n\"Everybody Here Wants You \u2013 whack that on,\" he says. And what's his best chat up line? He replies immediately.\n\"Well, I'm Danny Dyer. I don't need one. Whatever that means. Well, you know, fame and stuff, I don't think I've ever needed to use a chat up line.\n\"Obviously I've been with my missus for so long and I went through a period where I was quite desirable to women, and all of a sudden I've become desirable again, even though I'm a grandad, a balding sort of lumpy grandad.\"\nDyer says his wife has grown with him and kept him grounded. \"She's a very special human being and she's never really been fazed by my work.\"\nHe says he comes from a working class family and the Marching Powder screening was \"full of the working class lot that love our movies. And it's always great to be around real people, as I like to call them\".\n\"You know, the real people that keep this country going \u2013 the underrepresented at the moment, the underpaid, you know, people just existing at the moment,\" he says.\n\"We need more working class people in politics that know what it's like to be working class. And we need more working class people in the arts. The most creative people out there \u2013 musicians, actors, whatever, are working class people. End of it, full stop.\"\nDyer says Jack, his character in Marching Powder, is flawed but lovable.\n\"He's got no right to still be with his wife - the way he treats her, he just keeps on getting it wrong.\" \nBut he says audiences are hopefully rooting for Jack to save his marriage.\n\"To be a good patriarch is hard and every day is a lesson,\" says Dyer. \"Look after the ones around you.\"\n\"What is love?,\" Dyer asks.\n\"It's falling in love with people's flaws, that's why we stay with people, we meet people, we have a mask on that we're so perfect and then we got to the next level where you take that mask off and it's the weird, quirky stuff that you either go \u2013 see you later, you're elbowed \u2013 or, ooh, I quite like that about you.\"\nDyer says love is an interesting dynamic.\n\"We need more love in the world, by the way,\" he says. \n\"Where's all the love gone? Too much hatred and division going on.\"\nMarching Powder is out in cinemas from 7th March.",

How have they settled, what impact have they had, and what do they make of events in the White House and beyond in recent days?\nUp to the end of 2024, there had been 219,400 arrivals into the UK as part of the scheme, although some have since left the country. \nThe Homes for Ukraine scheme allowed UK and Irish citizens, and those with settled status in the UK, to sponsor the visa of somebody from Ukraine and host them for a minimum of six months.\nBuckinghamshire Council said it had had more than 1,100 sponsors since the conflict began in 2022, and that there were 433 Ukrainians of school age in education in the area.\nWhile Ukraine has seldom been far from the headlines in the past three years, events have moved very quickly in the past few days.\nThere were unprecedented scenes in the White House last Friday when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and JD Vance in front of the world's media.\nThey culminated in Zelensky being ordered to leave the White House before flying to London where he received a strong show of support from European leaders.\nSarah Graham runs Hilltops Ukrainian Support Community, which has helped almost 600 people settle into the area around the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire, three-quarters of whom are now in their own homes.\nShe says that after participating in events in London last week, the group got together last Friday to commemorate the third anniversary of the start of the war.\n\"Sitting with around 200 of our Ukrainian friends, we heard the news of what was unfolding in the Oval Office with feelings of utter dismay,\" she says.\n\"There is so much to be said, so many thoughts and so many emotions, but the message is clear: we will walk with our Ukrainian friends hand in hand.\n\"We want to see an end to the war in Ukraine, but peace has to be sustainable and supported from all sides.\n\"It was very encouraging to see Sir Keir Starmer host the summit on Sunday, with leaders who will do what it takes to achieve lasting peace.\"\nOn the day-to-day issues faced by refugees, Sarah, who was appointed MBE in 2023 for her work, says: \"Through a wide array of initiatives, we foster a strong sense of belonging and mutual care, helping Ukrainians overcome challenges as they rebuild their lives.\"\nThe group joined in with the Peace in the Park event in Chesham in September and also held a Ukrainian festival in Amersham.\n\"It has been a privilege to see our Ukrainian friends not only rebuilding their lives, but contributing to our county through volunteering to help others and actively participating in a huge range of community events,\" adds Sarah.\n\"Their resilience and engagement inspires us all.\"\nThe BBC spoke to three women from Ukraine who said they loved the green countryside and rolling hills of Buckinghamshire, but had also experienced challenges.\nIryna Chekmarova, 37, and her daughter live with a host family in Old Amersham, although she hopes they may be able to get their own place soon.\nShe was also dismayed by events in the White House on Friday.\n\"It was total humiliation from the very beginning. Zelensky was brave enough to not use an interpreter. He was brave enough to answer all questions truly,\" she says.\n\"We've been living in this war for almost three years and I feel even more scared and anxious right now about the future of our country.\"\nReferring to criticism Zelensky faced for not wearing a suit to the meeting, she says: \"Even Winston Churchill didn't wear a suit when his country was in the war. I am happy that almost all Europe and Great Britain support Ukraine in this difficult time.\"\nIryna's  came to Britain without her husband, who was not allowed to leave Ukraine. He makes weapons in a factory in Kharkiv, close to the Russian border. \nShe still visits him, but \"only sees him for a little bit each day\".\nShe says people ask her why she goes back, and while she admits it is \"quite dangerous\", she says she feels a \"brightness and is really happy\" when she does.\nIn Buckinghamshire, she has struggled to find employment, although says \"it is not difficult to find work in kitchens\", adding that \"even if you do not speak English, they will show you what to do\".\nShe is studying global business management at university to try to improve her prospects.\nA Healthwatch Bucks report reveals that although almost two-thirds of migrants said it was easy to register with a GP, a third had not seen a dentist in the UK and only half had visited an optician.\nAnna Putiata, 38, a project manager who lives in Wendover, says she has had problems finding a GP as she \"needs to find a doctor she trusts and can go to all the time\".\nShe says she experienced health problems when she first arrived in the UK, but now has health insurance through work, which has helped.\nAnna adds that she lacked confidence in English because \"she is surrounded by people who are fluent\" but \"is lucky to have people around to help\" her.\nTetiana Pantielieieva, 35, lives in High Wycombe with her son.\nShe says she has also had problems with the language, and sometimes worries whether words she uses \"really exist in the English language\".\nShe works for Buckinghamshire Council but speaks to a lot of Ukrainians who tell her healthcare is very different in this country.\nShe says loneliness is also a problem for people who tell her \"in a British manner 'Yeah, I'm fine, thanks'\" but when they get home, \"lonely evenings are a reality\", even if they are with their children.\nBuckinghamshire Council hired seven English tutors and is training 15 Ukrainian and Afghans to become ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) tutors. \nAlysoun Owen, who teaches English to Ukrainiains at the Aylesbury Vineyard church, says there are issues \"after the six-month programme ended and over rehousing\".\nShe says the group's command of the language is \"getting better, with lessons being a social group, as much as anything else\".\nShe feels Buckinghamshire has a \"real sense of welcoming people from different parts of the world\" with Afghans and Syrians settling there, too.\nThe BBC spoke to some of the group at the church.\nOleksandra lives in Haddenham with her husband and two children, one of whom was born here. \nShe says the church is \"very nice and is a big community\" where she has more friends.\nTetiana, who works in the church, hopes to \"maybe\" stay here with her teenage daughter, if she can.\nKateryna, who lives in Aylesbury, says a doctor helped her with a \"hard labour\".

Clothes listed as \"recycled polyester\" in the shops are most likely made up of recycled plastic bottles rather than old clothing.\nPeter Page, head of recycling and sustainability, said: \"It's very difficult because clothing is not designed to be recycled. It's designed to be bought, to be worn and then to be thrown away.\"\nHe explained that for textile recycling you mostly rely on single fibre materials but the use of synthetic materials in most fast fashion items makes that difficult.\nWorkers grade the clothing by quality, category and colour and the clothes need to be clean and dry to get reused or recycled.\nMr Page said that 75 per cent of the clothing that comes through the centre can be reused and is sold to wholesalers across the world.\nClothes that get sent for recycling are also used for carpet underlay, noise insulation or wiping cloths for the oil and gas industry, while new ideas are always being explored.\nThen, about three per cent of the clothes that are not fit for reuse or recycling are sent for incineration.\nSWD is getting busier every year, Mr Page said, but the quality of the clothes coming in makes it harder for them to reuse. \nQuite a lot. Among them, Valery Touchet started free classes to teach people how to sew and repurpose old clothes instead of throwing them out.\nMs Touchet said she had noticed the tradition of hand-me-down clothes she grew up with had changed to a culture of simply \"buying and throwing\".\n\"I just thought if I could educate people on how to reuse what they have already instead of buying new, that would help,\" she said.\nThe classes have brought together women from all different backgrounds, many who said they valued the \"sisterhood\" they had built as well as the new skills they have learned.\nMeanwhile, the Manchester Fashion Movement is helping to educate people about sustainable fashion by going into schools, hosting panel talks and organising pop-up exhibitions and fashion shows with an educational message.\nAlison Carlin said she wanted to \"champion local northern talent\" and send people away from her events \"with knowledge they can go on to discuss\". \nThrowing clothes into household waste bins means they are likely to end up in landfill.\nDisposing of clothes in a local authority textile bin located at recycling centres across the region or taking them to charity shops is the best way to prevent this.\nHowever, Dr Patsy Perry, reader in fashion marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) acknowledged how hard it is to be sustainable amid the temptation to buy new clothes advertised more vividly than ever online.\n\"The best thing we can do is wear what we already own,\" she said.\n\"Don't buy new things if you are only going to wear them once, and there are other solutions like charity shopping or even luxury resellers to explore.\"\nMs Touchet agreed, adding: \"Look through your wardrobe, there is always something [to recycle].\"\n\"If you don't know how to go about it, that's where I come in, to help you refashion, reuse them and repurpose. \n\"If it was a dress before we can turn it into a blouse, or a top and a skirt.\"\nA project by MMU has been collecting surplus clothing from across Greater Manchester, looking at whether the textiles are reusable, reusable but low quality, or non-reusable.\nMore than half the textiles in the sample were categorised as high-quality reusable, a small proportion were low quality but reusable, and less than a third were non reusable.\nAs part of the project, textiles that come through the Bolton sorting centre are being scanned to find out the material composition.\nThe hope is that the results will work out how many of the garments could be recycled into new textiles or other uses - in order to ensure fewer clothes go to waste.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to sign a deal with the US on the joint development of his country's mineral deposits at \"any time and in any convenient format\". \nIt comes days after an acrimonious visit to Washington, during which Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance in front of journalists and TV cameras. \nThe deal was supposed to be signed during that visit, but was put on hold as the Ukrainian president left the White House early.  \nDays later, in a social media statement which came hours after the US paused all military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky expressed his gratitude over American support for Ukraine and said he was ready to sign the deal. \nTrump said he appreciated the message, although it is not clear if or when the deal will be signed. \nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine. \nThis includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.\nIt is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. \nOther elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.\nDeposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nFor instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nTrump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough.

        "article_text": "Most of the world found itself confined to their homes in March 2020 as Covid-19 spread at a blistering pace. Some countries didn't impose any lockdown restrictions \u2013 so was their decision the right one?\nIn March 2020, billions of people stared out through their windows at a world they no longer recognised. Suddenly confined to their homes, their lives had shrunk abruptly to four walls and computer screens.\nAround the world, national leaders appeared on television, telling them to stay put \u2013 only leave the house to buy essential supplies or for once-daily exercise, maybe. It was a last-ditch attempt to curb the spread of a terrifying virus that had already killed many thousands of people worldwide.\nIn London, theatre worker Tony Beckingham and his partner decided to use their daily exercise to cycle into the centre of the city one evening. \"We thought it'd be really fun to see no-one around,\" he says. It wasn't. Places the pair knew well, like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, perennially abuzz with people, were chillingly quiet. \"It was really upsetting \u2013 instantly,\" says Beckingham.\nThis deletion of the public from city streets, venues and businesses first began in China, where Covid-19 emerged. Quarantine orders were soon replicated in other countries after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. At no prior point in human history have people faced restrictions like this on such a scale.\nBut a handful of countries did things differently. Sweden, Taiwan, Uruguay, Iceland and a few others never enacted a lockdown that involved severe restrictions on the movement of people, such as legally binding stay-at-home orders applied across large swathes of the population. Those countries instead chose other measures, such as restrictions on large gatherings of people, extensive testing and quarantining infected people or travel restrictions.\nFive years later, the scientific studies and data have piled up, offering a detailed, long-term assessment of whether these countries were right to reject this most drastic of public health interventions.\nThe Swedish city of Gothenburg is a haven for dog-lovers, says HR administrator and blogger Anna Mc Manus, \"We have a very dog-friendly city here,\" she says. \"We even have a dog-friendly cinema.\" As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government had decided to buck the trend.\nShe heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. South Africa was one such country. This struck Mc Manus as terrible. At the time, she wrote a blog post in which she said, \"I am convinced that my government is acting in a secure and correct way\". However, she also expressed concern that her fellow Swedes were not always following the official public health guidelines around social distancing, such as limiting the number of people who could meet together in a group.\nMc Manus remembers taking frequent walks in beauty spots, but also that she and her colleagues continually wore masks to help prevent Covid-19 transmission at the veterinary hospital where she worked in 2020. Plus, she and her partner avoided restaurants and meeting up with lots of other people. Even now, Mc Manus says she is not sure what to make of Sweden's official strategy.\n\"I want to base it on facts \u2013 like how many people died,\" she says. \"Could we have saved a lot more people if we had had a lockdown?\"\nScientists have tried to answer that question. Ingeborg Forthun at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and researchers in other countries including Sweden published a study in May 2024 that compared excess deaths in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland during the first years of the pandemic.\nWhile Sweden avoided strict government imposed controls, instead relying mainly on voluntary behavioural changes from is citizens, the other three nations imposed strict lockdowns in the early stages of the pandemic. Norway, Finland and Denmark closed schools and most other aspects of public life while also asking people to work from home, but they stopped short of confining people to their homes in the way other countries such as the UK did.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found a noticeable spike in excess deaths in Sweden during the initial waves of the pandemic during the spring and winter of 2020, when Covid-19 was able to spread more freely than in neighbouring nations. But while excess mortality fell in the three other countries in 2020, it rose compared to Sweden in 2021 and 2022.\n\"The four countries have a comparable number of excess deaths when you account for the fact that population sizes differ,\" says Forthun. What lockdowns did affect, in part, was the timing of when spikes in excess deaths occurred. Of Norway's approach, Forthun adds: \"We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period.\" Whereas authorities in Sweden were criticised in 2020 over high numbers of deaths at care homes.\nSome economists have combined similar data with comparisons of economic performance indicators between the same four Nordic countries to argue that, overall, Sweden's approach was justified due to the relatively low economic costs. But such arguments are controversial and the lack of a lockdown in Sweden remains an area for heated debate among some.\nAnother study by a group of German economists \u2013 who modelled how a lockdown could have affected pandemic outcomes in Sweden \u2013 suggests that the substantial voluntary restraints enacted by people in the country appear to have replicated some of the effects of a lockdown anyway.\nOne Swedish epidemiologist, Nele Brusselaers, of the Karolinska Institute, has criticised her country's Covid-19 strategy. She moved to Belgium during the pandemic.\n\"I'm a medical doctor so of course I care about lives,\" she says. \"We want to save every single life.\" She says many of her fellow Swedes are \"still in denial\" about Covid-19 though some have come to question the lack of lockdown in recent years.\nBrusselaers, who lived in Sweden in 2020, notes how her posts about Covid-19 on social media resulted in fierce pushback from some who disagreed with her stance on lockdown as an appropriate strategy. \"You get so much hatred,\" she says. \"That's not something I was used to.\"\nEven today, some people find it hard to move past the hostility they faced on the topic of lockdowns. One university researcher approached by the BBC for this article said they were so traumatised by the abuse they received online in 2020 that they never intended to comment on Covid-19 control measures, or lockdowns, publicly again.\nFurthermore, some people who lived in countries without lockdowns, and who disagreed with their government's approach, are still reeling from the experience. Tanzania never had any Covid-19 lockdowns. The country's former President, John Magufuli, who dismissed lockdowns and other public health interventions, died in 2021. Magufuli's approach to the pandemic was \"unscientific\", says history lecturer Fadhili Mtani at the Muslim University of Morogoro in Tanzania. \"He advocated for traditional herbs and later he rejected vaccines.\"\nBut Mtani recalls visiting hospitals where members of his own family had passed away of an illness. \"I saw people suffocating in the hospitals,\" he says. \"The hospital said we should not say it's Covid.\" Official figures suggest around 840 people have died of Covid-19 in Tanzania since the start of the pandemic. Mtani says that the government has not made accurate statistics available, however. An international collaboration aimed at estimating the global excess deaths during the first two years of the pandemic has put the total number of deaths in Tanzania at somewhere between 102,000-188,000.\nMtani argues that Tanzania should have enforced a lockdown, though without placing excessive restrictions on the movement of workers. \"The majority of people are poor. To deny movement for them is to deny their existence,\" Mtani explains.\nMany scientists emphasise that lockdowns were crucial for saving lives in the early part of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, and also for limiting the pressure on health services. By March 2020, this pressure was already severe in the UK, says Adam Kucharski, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \"The NHS was overwhelmed,\" Kucharski explains, referring to the emotional testimony of doctors who have spoken to the UK's public inquiry into the government\u2019s Covid-19 response. \"It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point,\" adds Kucharski.\nKucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live together or with their parents compared to Sweden, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.\nHe also points to a 2021 study that attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. It reveals that certain aspects of national lockdowns might have been more impactful than others. The researchers found, for example, that banning gatherings of more than 10 people or closing schools and universities was especially effective, reducing transmission by more than 35% on average. Shutting restaurants and bars seemed to make slightly less difference to transmission, however.\nWhat's more, the researchers suggest that adding a strict stay-at-home order on top of such measures \"only had a small additional effect\" in terms of slowing down Covid-19 \u2013 estimated at below 17.5% on average.\nCountries that chose not to lock down severely may also have had more time to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19, or social and structural reasons as to why the Sars-CoV-2 virus was less likely to spread quickly there versus other nations. Even then, there are surprising comparisons to be made. Take Iceland and New Zealand, for instance. Both are wealthy island nations with relatively small populations but while New Zealand introduced a strict lockdown on 25 March 2020, Iceland never did.\n\"They [Iceland] had more of a mitigation strategy,\" says Leah Grout, a research data analyst specialising in public health at the Southern California University of Health Sciences. Grout was lead author on a research paper about the contrasting Covid-19 strategies and outcomes of these two countries. Iceland introduced a test and trace programme, in which infections and contacts between people were monitored so that individuals \u2013 rather than entire populations \u2013 were asked to observe quarantine for a time. This measure was also used in many countries that also applied lockdowns, when those lockdowns were lifted. Iceland had some restrictions on social gatherings and it did close its borders to some travellers, briefly.\n\"New Zealand had one of the lowest mortality rates globally with their approach,\" says Grout. \"Iceland also fared pretty well.\" Plus, the economic impacts on both countries were limited, she adds. Other researchers have made similar findings regarding New Zealand and Iceland.\nMore like this:\nMuch was written in 2020 about various countries' efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in retrospect, that seems much too early to come to any real conclusions. Uruguay was lauded at the time for apparently managing to keep Covid-19 at bay, despite never enacting a strict lockdown. The country's government enforced some forms of social distancing, including the closure of some gyms, and Uruguay's borders were also closed to certain travellers, for instance. But ports remained open and there was no stay-at-home order affecting the entire population.\nA study published in 2024 found that, while excess deaths were low in Uruguay during 2020, they actually rose substantially in 2021 and 2022. Excess deaths in 2021, for example, were nearly 19% above the expected figure, based on historical trends. The study's authors put this down mostly to the spread of Covid-19 but add that impacts from the pandemic on the ability to provide healthcare in other ways probably also played a role.\nSimilarly, Japan was able to keep mortality from Covid-19 to a relatively low level in the early part of the pandemic. By the summer of 2022, Covid-19 deaths had reached 36,200. Today, they stand at 130,000.\nSo, what happened in the interim? The Omicron variant. New, mutated forms of the early Sars-CoV-2 virus that spread worldwide in 2022 and 2023.\nSome researchers argue that Japan\u2019s approach proved to be the right one overall. \"Even without lockdown, suppression of epidemic curves has been largely successful,\" argues Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor in the graduate school of medicine at Kyoto University.\nHowever, as in other countries where legally binding lockdowns did not come into force, there is evidence that people in Japan changed their behaviour significantly anyway. One study of people's movements based on mobile phone data suggests that, when the Japanese government declared a nationwide state of emergency in April 2020, people in Tokyo reduced their outings from home roughly as much as people in the US who, conversely, faced legally binding lockdowns.\nDespite this, Yasuharu Tokuda, a clinical epidemiologist and director of the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, argues that a tougher approach might have been beneficial. \"Some patients could not be admitted to the hospital because of the lack of available beds,\" he says. \"If we have a strong viral pandemic, then we need to have a stricter lockdown in Japan.\" Research suggests that there might be resistance to such an idea among members of the public in Japan, however.\nIt is important to reflect on just how drastic a measure lockdown really is. Kucharski, for one, calls it a \"blunt\" tool. \"We should never have got to that point where we were in so much trouble, with so little visibility of what the pandemic was doing,\" he says. It was due to a lack of certainty over what would happen next, and a dearth of other interventions on the table, that the UK was more or less forced into lockdown, he suggests.\nMany have still not got over the effects of lockdown. In March 2020, Bill Allison, a former civil servant in Scotland, was in his mid-60s. He had many plans for his retirement \u2013 he wanted to see the world. Back then, Allison was also an avid pub-goer who frequently met up with his friends for a pint. Lockdown stopped him in his tracks. He says he followed the rules at all times but this left him feeling a profound sense of loneliness and isolation.\n\"I gathered up all the scraps of wood that I had and decided to see if I could make them into an electric guitar,\" he says. \"I would work late at night. There was nothing else to do, really.\" He found a guitar-making group online, through which he met people with similar interests. \"I made quite a lot of new friends.\"\nBut when the world gradually began to open up again, Allison was struck by a strong sense of what he had been missing and was hard to regain.\n\"The pub near me, it's nothing like as busy as it was before Covid,\" he says. \"I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before. I was discussing it with a few of my friends. [\u2026] We all feel very unhappy.\"\nSoon to turn 72, Allison says his pre-pandemic travel plans remain on hold. \"I'm kind of getting to the age where I don't really want to do a nine-hour flight to the other side of the world anymore. It's kind of knocked me back.\"\nCountless studies show that social isolation and loneliness affected thousands of people during the pandemic, and that this was a particularly acute problem during national lockdowns. There were negative impacts on single parents, also, who found it harder to earn an income while looking after their children. There were also concerns that the sudden loss of social interaction and access to education effected the development of young children, with some evidence pointing to an impact on their language skills. More than one billion children and students found themselves shut off from their usual methods of learning. Recently published research using data from 72 countries suggests that the closure of schools during the pandemic may have led to a decline in mathematics scores by an average of 14% \u2013 equivalent to seven months of learning.\nIn countries including the UK, lockdown was associated with a rise in domestic abuse. And, what's more, lockdowns had a huge impact on access to healthcare. Many people found their cancer screenings and treatments were cancelled or delayed, for example.\nAs for potential benefits of lockdowns not related to Covid-19 transmission, much was made of temporary reductions in air pollution and carbon emissions as a result of the restrictions imposed during the early stages of the pandemic. These turned out to be a temporary blip as greenhouse gas emissions resurged and air quality dipped once people emerged from their confinement.\nAuthorities in some countries that attempted to enforce strict lockdowns and a \"zero Covid\" policy were greeted with violent protests from members of the public. Some widely publicised cases of this emerged in China during 2022.\nThere is no getting away from the fact that a sweeping stay-at-home order is an extreme intervention, and one that comes with heaps of negative consequences. Governments in 2020 had to weigh up whether they could successfully enforce such a measure, and whether it was really worth it.\nUnless, of course, they had an alternative. The government in Taiwan, for example, never imposed a lockdown and instead relied on near-universal mask-wearing, border restrictions and intensive contact tracing, which involved access to lots of personal data. This included commuters' smart card information and mobile phone location data. Some of this monitoring was exhaustive.\n\"[Taiwan Centers for Disease Control] also set up a smartphone-based real-time locating system to track contacts' phone signals and alert local authorities if anyone left their designated location or switched off their phone. Authorities would contact or visit those who triggered an alert within 15 minutes in person,\" one paper notes.\nEssentially, Taiwan (and later South Korea, which to some extent mirrored Taiwan's approach) avoided lockdown through fine-grained monitoring and control of an entire population. Even in Taiwan, however, Covid-19 outbreaks caused problems. Initially, in the first half of 2021 and then again in 2022, cases surged as some preventative measures in the country, and the population itself, started to relax. Researchers note, though, that Covid-19 deaths became less common over time, as Taiwan's health authorities rolled out vaccines to the population.\nWhile these case studies of various countries show that it was clearly possible to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic without resorting to national lockdowns, the end results seem to depend on the attributes of specific countries, their populations, and their healthcare systems. Ultimately, the vast majority of nations did enact lockdowns at some point during 2020 or 2021 and it would be hard to suggest that they are all significantly worse off because of that intervention, specifically.\nStill, five years later, the harshness of lockdowns and their effects on millions if not billions of people has become clearer. Even some researchers who have found evidence that lockdowns saved lives have cautioned against turning to this measure in haste in the future. The longer-term effects on children, education and economies are still playing out and will likely not be fully understood for many years to come.\nWhatever governments decide to do, having a plan that they communicate in advance of any new pandemic will likely improve public acceptance of and adherence to any strict mitigations, says Grout. \"It needs to be super clear.\" That means everyone could know ahead of time what circumstances would trigger a lockdown.\nIn Gothenburg, Mc Manus remembers the debates she once had with her fellow Swedes over whether her country was doing the right thing in 2020. And how some people seemed cavalier or uninterested in observing social distancing guidelines at the time.\n\"You don't even talk about it anymore,\" she says, \"Thinking back, I feel like, as a society, did we really learn anything from this?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "Those countries instead chose other measures, such as restrictions on large gatherings of people, extensive testing and quarantining infected people or travel restrictions.Five years later, the scientific studies and data have piled up, offering a detailed, long-term assessment of whether these countries were right to reject this most drastic of public health interventions.AlamyFor billions of people around the world, the lockdown measures imposed during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic were intensely lonely (Credit: Alamy)The Swedish city of Gothenburg is a haven for dog-lovers, says HR administrator and blogger Anna Mc Manus, \"We have a very dog-friendly city here,\" she says. Norway, Finland and Denmark closed schools and most other aspects of public life while also asking people to work from home, but they stopped short of confining people to their homes in the way other countries such as the UK did.We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period \u2013 Ingeborg ForthunPerhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found a noticeable spike in excess deaths in Sweden during the initial waves of the pandemic during the spring and winter of 2020, when Covid-19 was able to spread more freely than in neighbouring nations. As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government had decided to buck the trend.She heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. \"It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point,\" adds Kucharski.Kucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live together or with their parents compared to Sweden, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.He also points to a 2021 study that attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. Ingeborg Forthun at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and researchers in other countries including Sweden published a study in May 2024 that compared excess deaths in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland during the first years of the pandemic.While Sweden avoided strict government imposed controls, instead relying mainly on voluntary behavioural changes from is citizens, the other three nations imposed strict lockdowns in the early stages of the pandemic.",

        "article_text": "Cyriel Dessers scored one goal, assisted another, and had two efforts disallowed against Fenerbahce\nJust short of the hour mark in Istanbul, after he had scored Rangers' first, brilliantly assisted their second, then came inches away, twice, from adding a third, Cyriel Dessers reminded you of a boxer, dancing around the ring, toying with a bewildered opponent.\nThe Fenerbahce backline were on the ropes. Their defences were down and so were their heads. They remonstrated with each other about this menace in their midst and their inability to stop him. Dessers was running amok.\nThere were many major performers on this night of nights for Rangers - all of them, quite frankly - but Dessers was one of the star turns.\nRangers folk have had a torrid relationship with him. A kind of Richard Burton-Elizabeth Taylor vibe if you are old enough to catch the drift, an on-off thing, love and hate, tempestuous, never dull.\nThe big man scored his fourth European goal of the season and delivered his fourth assist. He is on 22 goals this term now, to match the 22 he got last season. \n'Calm down, it's not over', Mourinho warns Rangers\nRangers earn stunning win over Fenerbahce\nRangers reaction, analysis & have your say\nIf you look back over Rangers' past 25 to 30 years, you'll see that Alfredo Morelos and Kris Boyd managed back-to-back 20-plus goal seasons in the top flight, but it is a pantheon with few heroes.\nThat's not a word many among the Rangers support would associate with Dessers. \nHe has spoken before about feeling written off only months into his first season at the club - last season - how his misses were more talked about than his goals and how it made him feel like the worst Rangers player ever. His description.\nOn Thursday, he looked like one of the best Rangers strikers of several decades. Classy, dangerous, resilient, he was inches away from an away European hat-trick. \nOne goal, one assist and one lovely cushioned pass to Nico Raskin before his sumptuous delivery to Vaclav Cerny for the goal that made it 3-1 was a mighty contribution from a maligned player who just keeps going no matter the doubt that rings in his ears from the stands.\nMaybe that has changed now. Or, perhaps, it is changing. Not there yet, but moving fast in the right direction. \nMaybe you could say the same about Rangers in Europe.\nThis tie isn't over, but they produced something very special in Istanbul and take a two-goal buffer to Glasgow next week. Nobody saw that coming. Absolutely nobody. \nThey were immense. Had they won by four instead of two then Jose Mourinho suggested that he could have had no complaints.\nThis was a glorious night for the 'Four Bears' - the interim coaching team of former Rangers men led by Barry Ferguson - and a continuation of the surreality that surrounds this collection of players.\nDefeats in recent weeks by Motherwell, St Mirren and Queen's Park in the Scottish Cup. A manager sacked. A support in uproar. A Glasgow rival laughing in their face, 16 points clear in the league and so far ahead on every metric that you wonder when, or if, the chasm between them will close.\nA team that struggles hopelessly when dealing with the low blocks of smaller clubs domestically - they have dropped points in 11 out of 29 league matches - and then delivers their very best stuff against better teams in European football.\nSigmund Freud could not get to the heart of this lot. He would end up on the couch himself with Carl Jung waving a fan and some smelling salts in his face.\nFrom joyless defeats at home against teams with fractions of their budget to steepling victories away against European big shots, this lays claim to be the oddest of all Rangers sides, the one that is capable of the most jaw-dropping extremes.\nThis video can not be played\n'Brilliant result but I'm not getting carried away' - Ferguson\nIs there one to rival them in the Rangers 'odditorium'? Club historians will have plenty to say on that. \nIn more recent memory, the Giovanni van Bronckhorst side of 2021-22 are worth a mention. They got to the Europa League final that season, only losing on penalties. \nThey beat the Borussia Dortmund of Mats Hummels, Raphael Guerreiro and Jude Bellingham then the RB Leipzig of Konrad Laimer, Josko Gvardiol, Dani Olmo and Dominik Szoboszlai.\nOne missed penalty in the final shootout against an Eintracht Frankfurt side later broken up and sold on for serious money was all that stopped them. \nAll of those massive nights against heavy-hitters in Europe and they had to settle for second place in the Scottish Premiership to Ange Postecoglou's new Celtic team.\nThere are big differences between that team and the Rangers of today, though.

        "article_text": "Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine is ready to sign a deal with the US over his country's mineral deposits, days after he was told to leave the White House following a fiery exchange with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance. \nThe deal was expected to be signed during Zelensky's visit to Washington, but was put on hold after the meeting in front of journalists and TV cameras turned into a shouting match.\nThe relationship between the two leaders showed little sign of improving in the days afterwards, with the US announcing it was pausing all military aid to Ukraine. \nHours after that announcement, Zelensky posted a lengthy message on social media expressing his gratitude for American support for Ukraine, and saying his country was ready to sign the minerals deal at \"any time and in any convenient format\".\nIn a speech to Congress, Trump said he appreciated the message from Zelensky, but it is currently unclear if or when the deal will be signed.\nMultiple sources have told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the terms of the deal have not yet been finalised and could change from a previous version, which was published by Ukrainian media before Zelensky's meeting with Trump and Vance.  \nThat version of the deal envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction, which Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said would be managed by Kyiv and Washington on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the text, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nThe US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law, the agreement says.\nIn the days before the deal was supposed to be signed, disagreement over its terms formed part of a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but this demand was dropped from the version published online. \n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the US has given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nNo such guarantee has yet been made, although the published text says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nTrump has suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee, but responsibility for Ukraine's security would now fall to Europe. \nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump initially said Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals, but in the days after the spat in Washington he paused all US military aid to Ukraine. \nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at the meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead descended into a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is currently unclear when the deal might be signed.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's land mass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nBefore the deal was supposed to be signed, Vladimir Putin told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.\nFigures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.\nExperts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.\nBut the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.\n\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"\nMost UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases. \nWith home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.\nHeat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.\nAbout half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support. \nOne of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.\nEd Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.\n\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.\nIn its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.\nMr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive. \n\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.\nHe also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.\n\nDespite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.\nBut Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.\n\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.\nMadeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.\n\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.\nThis explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.\nMs Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.\nIn a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills. \n\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.\nAdditional reporting by Justin Rowlatt.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "summary": "UK homes install subsidised heat pumps at record level12 hours agoShareSaveEsme StallardClimate and science reporter, BBC NewsBecky DaleData journalist, BBC VerifyShareSaveAndrew Aitchison/Getty ImagesThe number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy. With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). \"What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government toldMost UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases. One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",

        "article_text": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu \u2013 a custodian Buddhist deity \u2013 was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\u00a0\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\u00a0\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima Island\u00a0\u2013 a key stop along the way\u00a0\u2013 says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was \u2013 quite ambitiously \u2013 armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me \u2013 and other beginners \u2013 Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) \u2013 stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges \u2013 at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n\u2022\u00a0How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022\u00a0The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled Mukaishima Island.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nRussell won't 'bow down' to Verstappen\nGeorge Russell looks you in the eye and oozes self-belief as he describes how he feels heading into his seventh season in Formula 1, his first as effective leader of the Mercedes team.\n\"I know my time will come,\" the 27-year-old Briton says. \"And I've just got to ensure that I keep on performing. And whether it's this year or next year, it'll come.\n\"And if I keep delivering those results, as I did over these last three years against the best driver of all time, I believe I will get myself in the fight and hopefully a world championship to my name.\"\nRussell's self-confidence is deeply held, and has been there for as long as he has been racing. But it has been nurtured by the time he spent at Mercedes as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton.\nLast year, Russell became the first driver in Hamilton's 18-year career to comprehensively beat the seven-time champion in qualifying over a full season. The head-to-head score was 19-five to Russell, at an average advantage of 0.171 seconds a lap.\nAnd over their three years together since 2022, Russell finished ahead in the championship in two of them.\nThere are caveats - not least that Hamilton's final year at Mercedes came after he had told the team he was leaving them for Ferrari at the end of it.\nBut, as Russell puts it in an exclusive interview with BBC Sport: \"The results speak for themselves. And I don't have anything I need to prove or show.\n\"I am proud of the results I've achieved going up against somebody like Lewis.\n\"At the end of 2021, statistically and in terms of perception, Lewis was the greatest of all time. And I've had three years against the greatest of all time, and I finished ahead of him two out of the three years I had as team-mates. And finished ahead more times in 'quali' and more times in the race.\n\"If this was a different time or a different era, if you finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton, you're a world champion.\"\nWith Hamilton's departure, Russell, becomes the senior driver at Mercedes. His new team-mate is Andrea Kimi Antonelli, an 18-year-old Italian prodigy who has been on Mercedes' books for several years.\n\"He's a great kid,\" Russell says. \"He's very young, but he's a really nice guy. Super-fast, of course.\n\"Being thrown in at the deep end, which is going to be a big challenge. But in terms of raw speed, I don't think you can question it. And there's going to be an interesting new dynamic.\"\nHamilton's departure, Russell says, referencing the explosion of interest the move to Ferrari has created, \"has been good for everyone\".\n\"This is turning a page,\" Russell says about a team that had employed Hamilton for 12 years. \"It's a new chapter. And I don't suddenly feel any additional responsibility.\"\nAnd what does he think Hamilton faces at Ferrari, alongside new team-mate Charles Leclerc, against whom Russell has raced since they were boys in karting?\n\"Charles is a fantastic driver,\" Russell says. \"No doubt about that. So I'm going to be really intrigued to see how that pans out because they're two amazing drivers.\n\"He's obviously entering an Italian team where Charles has been very much the number one for the past six years. It's quite an interesting dynamic, but I think it'll be close between the two of them.\"\nGeorge Russell and Max Verstappen criticised each other publically after a dispute at last year's Qatar Grand Prix\nThere is one big elephant in the room as Mercedes head into 2025 - and its name is Max Verstappen.\nTeam boss Toto Wolff has said the team \"very much hope that the 2025 line-up will be the line-up going forward\". But it is no secret that that Wolff courted Verstappen last year, and still has hopes of attracting him to the team - perhaps as early as 2026.\nIf he succeeds, one of the current drivers - both of whom have been nurtured by the team for years - would have to find a seat elsewhere.\nRussell is aware of this as a potential scenario, but professes not to be remotely concerned about it.\n\"I don't think there's any pressure whatsoever,\" he says \"All I need to do is continue doing what I'm doing, continue doing what I've done my whole career.\n\"So that changes nothing. And it's not even something I'm thinking about. Because I 100% back myself. It's as simple as that. You perform and everything will be there for you.\n\"I want to go up against the best. I don't feel that my ability is in question.\"\nThe Verstappen question is given added edge when it comes to Russell because of their personal history. The pair had a major falling out at the end of last season and there is no sign of relations thawing this. \nRussell says: \"I wasn't going to just stand and be bullied around. People seem to always back down to him. And that's just not how I go about my business.\n\"I'm not there to be best mates with a world champion. I'm here to win. And that's his mentality as well. There's no love lost.\n\"I've never been scared to race against Max. I've always put up a fight.\"\n\nGeorge Russell set the fastest time on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain on 28 February\nTense as the situation may be between Russell and Verstappen, any battles between them may not be for a race win at the start of the season, Russell believes.\n\"I don't think either of us right now have a car that potentially is capable of beating the McLaren,\" he says.\n\"McLaren, without doubt, look by far the strongest. Especially their race pace looks pretty impressive.\"\nMercedes won four races last year - two each for Russell and Hamilton - and have come into 2025 hoping for a car with more rounded abilities that can be competitive everywhere, rather than only on certain tracks and in certain conditions, as last year.\n\"There's definitely improvements throughout the car, no doubt about it,\" Russell says. \"Naturally, there's always something you need to work on.\n\"So, you know, we struggled a bit with low-speed understeer last year. There's still signs of that that we're still trying to get on top of, and we think we've got some things in the locker to try and cure those issues. But definitely the car's feeling a bit more together.\"\nRussell's focus this year will not only be on the track. As a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, he will also be forced to confront the concerns many in F1 have about the conduct of Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of governing body the FIA.\nA series of Ben Sulayem's actions have angered the drivers in recent years, and over the winter, new rules codifying a process by which drivers can face race bans for swearing have increased concerns. \nRussell chooses his words carefully, but is firm about the drivers' convictions.\n\"Things have gone a little bit out of hand in the recent months with some of the things that have been going on,\" he says, adding that he feels the FIA's stance is \"unnecessary\".\n\"Not only we're racing drivers,\" he says, \"we're personalities, and if you are the individual who wants to swear as much as you like, that has a certain impact on your brand and your perception regardless of the FIA getting involved.\n\"There's times and a place. You have to ensure that our emotions stay real and true, especially when it comes to the (in-car) radio, and potentially an interview straight after the race. That's what's so pure about it.\n\"If you're talking on a Thursday afternoon in front of a number of people, maybe swearing is not really necessary or required. But when it comes to that raw emotion, you need to let us be as authentic as possible.\"\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "summary": "The head-to-head score was 19-five to Russell, at an average advantage of 0.171 seconds a lap.And over their three years together since 2022, Russell finished ahead in the championship in two of them.There are caveats - not least that Hamilton's final year at Mercedes came after he had told the team he was leaving them for Ferrari at the end of it.But, as Russell puts it in an exclusive interview with BBC Sport: \"The results speak for themselves. \"There's definitely improvements throughout the car, no doubt about it,\" Russell says. But it has been nurtured by the time he spent at Mercedes as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton.Last year, Russell became the first driver in Hamilton's 18-year career to comprehensively beat the seven-time champion in qualifying over a full season. \"And if I keep delivering those results, as I did over these last three years against the best driver of all time, I believe I will get myself in the fight and hopefully a world championship to my name. \"Mercedes won four races last year - two each for Russell and Hamilton - and have come into 2025 hoping for a car with more rounded abilities that can be competitive everywhere, rather than only on certain tracks and in certain conditions, as last year.",

Stellantis shares in the US rose more than 9%.\n\"The president is open to hearing about additional exemptions,\" Ms Leavitt added. \"He always has open dialogue and he'll always do what he believes is right for the American people.\"\nFord said in a statement the company will continue to have a \"healthy and candid dialogue with the administration\" and touted its investment of billions in the United States. \n\nGoods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated. \nThe Canadian Chamber of Commerce warned that affordability would be hurt and business relationships would suffer, despite the chances for targeted relief. \n\"We've seen this movie before. President Trump puts tariffs in place and then doles out exemptions one at a time,\" said Matthew Holmes, the organisation's chief of public policy. \"That is not how a long-lasting trade alliance is built.\" \nOntario Premier Doug Ford told Canadian media that the one-month reprieve for automakers would not alter his plans for retaliation, which have already included a halt to sales of US liquor in the province.\n\nTrump's moves, and his threats to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries around the world, have raised fears of a wider trade war.\nAs well as Mexico and Canada, he hit goods from China with an additional tariff on Tuesday, raising levies to at least 20% and prompting the country to retaliate against US exports, including agricultural products. \nCanada also responded with its own retaliatory import levies on US goods after Washington's 25% tariffs on its two neighbours came into effect on Tuesday, affecting items including peanut butter, oranges and wine. \nMexico also said it would respond, including with its own tariffs.\n\"I don't know where we go with this and how it ends. I just hope that it ends quickly,\" said Iowa farmer Bob Hemesath, the board president for lobby group Farmers for Free Trade, which has raised concerns about the tariffs.  \nBig retailers in the US have already warned the measures will lead to higher prices on goods such as avocados within days, while economists are forecasting economic recessions in Mexico and Canada triggered by the tariffs.\nTrump has acknowledged his moves may lead to short-term economic pain in the US, but said he wants to protect US industry and boost manufacturing.\nHe has cast the tariffs this week against goods from America's two neighbours, as well as China, as a response to the flow of migrants and fentanyl across the border.\nWriting on social media on Wednesday, Trump said he had told Trudeau that the situation was not improving. \n\"He said that it's gotten better, but I said, 'That's not good enough',\" Trump said.\nTrudeau has called called Trump's claims about drugs a \"completely bogus\" justification for tariffs on his country.\nWhite House officials have said Trump still intends to move ahead on 2 April with plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries around the world that he sees as treating the US unfairly. \n\"There are going to be tariffs - let's be clear - but what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that maybe he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg on Wednesday.",

This is widely seen by Arab states, and many others, as the only lasting solution to this perpetual conflict, but it is firmly ruled out by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.\nThis new plan proposes that Gaza would be run, temporarily, by a \"Gaza management committee under the umbrella of the Palestinian government\" comprised of qualified technocrats.\nIt glosses over the issue of what role, if any, Hamas, will play. There is a vague reference to the \"obstacle\" of militant groups and said this issue would be resolved if the causes of the conflict with Israel were removed.\nSome Arab states are known to be calling for the complete dismantling of Hamas; others believe those decisions should be left up to the Palestinians. Hamas is said to have accepted it will not play a role in running Gaza but has made it clear that disarming is a red line.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described President Trump's plan as \"visionary\", has repeatedly ruled out any future role for Hamas, but also for the Palestinian Authority.\nThe other sensitive issue of security was dealt with by calling on the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers.\nAnd a major international conference will be held next month to raise the huge sums of money necessary for this rebuilding project.\nWealthy Gulf states appear willing to foot some of the colossal bill. But no one is ready to invest unless they are absolutely convinced buildings won't come crashing down in another war.\nA fragile ceasefire which now seems to be on the brink of collapse will only amplify that hesitation.\nThis new Arab plan to rebuild Gaza would unfold in three phases including an initial period of about six months, called the early recovery stage, to start clearing the massive amounts of rubble as well as unexploded ordinance. Two subsequent stages would last several years.\nDuring this time displaced Palestinians, said to number 1.5 million, would be housed in temporary containers. Photographs in the glossy brochure present them as well-built and designed housing units set in pretty landscaped areas.\nPresident Trump continues to wonder aloud \"Why wouldn't they want to move?\" His description of Gaza as a \"demolition site\" underlines how the territory lies in utter ruin. The UN says 90% of homes are damaged or destroyed. \nAll the basics of a life worth living, from schools and hospitals to sewage systems and electricity lines, are shredded.\nThe US President deepened the shock and anger around his ideas when he posted an AI-generated video of a golden Gaza on his Truth Social account which featured a shimmering statue of himself, his close ally Elon Musk enjoying snacks on the beach, and he and the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu sunning themselves, shirtless. All to a catchy tune, with lines like \"Trump Gaza is finally here\".\n\"They had President Trump in mind,\" remarked one Western diplomat who attended a briefing about Egypt's plan at the foreign ministry in Cairo. \"It's very glossy and very well-prepared.\"\nCairo's proposal is said to have drawn on a wide range of expertise, from World Bank professionals on sustainability, to Dubai developers on hotels.  \nThere are also lessons learned from other ravaged cities which rose from the ruins including Hiroshima, Beirut, and Berlin. And the proposed designs are also influenced by Egypt's own experience in developing its \"New Cairo\", its grand megaproject which has seen a new administrative capital rising from the desert \u2013 at great expense.\nThe American President has said he won't \"force\" his ideas on anyone but still insists his plan is the one \"that really works\".\nNow it is up to the Arab states and their allies to prove that their plan is the only plan.",

It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.\nSome patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already recommended aspirin.\nBut it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too. \nThese are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the Add-Aspirin trial to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back. \nShe said the study's results were \"an important discovery\" as they would help to work out \"who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis\".\nHowever, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to \"always talk to your doctor before starting\".\nIn the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.\nThe discovery, published in the journal Nature, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin.\nThe team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread.\nThey were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread.\nFurther investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body. \nDr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: \"It was a Eureka moment.\n\"It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated.\"",

Osborne, 23, has played on the wing for Leinster, but this will be his first time in the position at Test level.\nRonan Kelleher (neck) remains sidelined, so Rob Herring is set to make his first appearance of the tournament as replacement hooker with Dan Sheehan starting.\nGarry Ringrose's suspension means Bundee Aki returns to partner Robbie Henshaw in midfield, the latter switching to outside centre. \nFinlay Bealham returns at tight-head prop and Thomas Clarkson drops to the bench. Tadhg Furlong is still ruled out despite stepping up his rehabilitation from calf and hamstring injuries.\nLike Doris, Bealham and Jack Conan are set to win their 50th caps. Conan is one of six forwards named on the bench as Ireland opt to go for a 6-2 split for the first time this year.\n\"The team has worked hard again this week and the preparation has been positive for what we know will be a huge test against France,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"There's great respect and rivalry between the two teams and it should be a cracking contest.\"\nNtamack and Penaud return as France retain 7-1 bench\nSix Nations fixtures, standings, try-scorers & coverage\nSeven-one bench split would 'spook' Ireland - Fogarty\nAfter announcing they will retire from Test rugby at the end of the tournament, Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray will play in their final home match.\nMunster flanker O'Mahony retains his place after starting against Scotland and Wales, while Healy and Murray are named on the bench.\n\"This weekend gives the Irish public the chance to mark the final home international appearances for Peter, Cian and Conor \u2013 three stalwarts of Irish rugby who help drive the highest standards in our camp,\" added Easterby.\nHerring, Healy, Clarkson, Conan, James Ryan and Ryan Baird provide the forwards cover with Murray and Jack Crowley named as the two replacement backs.\nIt is the first time Ireland have opted for a 6-2 split on the bench since last year's loss in England - a result which ended Irish hopes of back-to-back Grand Slams.\nIreland did, however, use a 6-2 split in last year's resounding victory over France in Marseille.\nFrance, who named their team earlier on Thursday, have retained a 7-1 split on the bench having used the tactic against Italy last time out.\nIreland: Keenan; Osborne, Henshaw, Aki, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Porter, Sheehan, Bealham; McCarthy, Beirne; O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Doris (capt). \nReplacements: Herring, Healy, Clarkson, Ryan, Conan, Baird, Murray, Crowley.\nFrance: Ramos; Penaud, Barassi, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Ntamack, Dupont (capt); Gros, Mauvaka, Atonio; Flament, Guillard; Cros, Boudehent, Alldritt.\nReplacements: Marchand, Baille, Aldegheri, Meafou, Auradou, Jegou, Jelonch, Lucu.\nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "Florida has launched a criminal investigation into controversial British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate. \nAt the end of February, the brothers flew to the US from Romania, where they face rape and human-trafficking charges - which they deny.\nAndrew Tate, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, are dual US-UK citizens who claim to have made millions from their social media empire.\nTheir online output was controversial even before their legal troubles, with the pair attracting frequent criticism over offensive statements about women.\nThe pair have an American father who worked for the US Air Force in Britain. Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

But I don't have any evidence,\" she told the BBC in January, when she also talked about the shock of being shown those pictures by police for the first time. \nThe heated courtroom exchanges between Ms Darian and her father were some of the most dramatic in the 16-week trial that shocked France and the world. \"I never touched you, never,\" Pelicot pleaded to his daughter during one session. \"You are lying!\" Ms Darian shouted back.\nMs Darian has previously said she felt she was the trial's \"forgotten victim\" as, unlike in her mother's case, there was no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted upon her.\nShe told Elle France earlier this week that the charges she is pressing against her father were \"symbolic\" but \"in line with what I have said since the start: that I am a victim of chemical submission [drug-facilitated assault] but was never recognised as such\".\nShe has hired lawyer Florence Rault to represent her.\nFor many years, Ms Rault has been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s. \nOne, a young property agent known by the pseudonym Marion, was the victim of an attempted rape in 1999, to which Pelicot has admitted. \nThe other - also an estate agent in her 20s - was raped and murdered in 1991. Pelicot is currently being investigated over that case, but has always denied any involvement.\nMs Darian said she saw similarities between her and Marion. \"We look strangely alike. She is blonde, her hair is bobbed, we were born the same year... I wanted to meet her lawyer and hear all the details,\" she told Elle France.\nIn her police complaint, which was quoted by French media, Ms Rault lamented that Ms Darian had never been offered gynecological examinations nor had she been tested for the drugs Pelicot used on his wife. \nMs Rault said the investigation had only focused on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and that her client had been treated as a \"peripheral victim\". She asked the authorities to launch a fresh \"serious and in-depth\" inquiry.\nB\u00e9atrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, told French media that Ms Darian's decision to press charges was \"unsurprising given her statements and beliefs during the Avignon trial\".\nShe also said that the prosecutors in Avignon, in south-eastern France, said there were insufficient \"objective elements\" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on his daughter.\n\nForty-nine men were sentenced in December alongside Dominque Pelicot. All were found guilty of at least one charge - rape or sexual assault - against Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. \nSeventeen initially said they would appeal the charges against them, but seven of those have since changed their minds. \nThose who decide to press ahead with their appeals will go on trial at the end of the year in N\u00eemes, southern France.\nThe first trial - which lasted from September to December 2024 - garnered worldwide attention thanks to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump's latest move has left investors in a spin - for good reason.\nWith the stroke of a pen, the tariffs he has imposed on Canada, Mexico and China have turned back the clock 70 years, erasing decades of globalisation.\nTariffs, he says is a beautiful word, signalling jobs and riches for America.\nHowever, history tells us that those firing the opening shots in a trade war also  suffer heavy casualties. Despite the president's rhetoric, American consumers are  on the front line.\nThese extra taxes mean that Americans are facing the highest level of tariffs on goods being imported to their country since the 1930s. \nVegetables from Mexico, wheat from Canada, toys and T-shirts from China are all in the firing line. Retailers of such items can have very narrow profit margins and will raise prices quickly to cover the tariffs. \nConsumers will notice the price rises.\nGroceries may be one of Trump's favourite words, but his own electorate may not appreciate the increase in bills they could face. Assuming no further tariffs, economists suggest US inflation, already higher than expected, could rise further in the second half of this year.\nA price worth paying \"to make America great again\"? Look no further than the laundry room for a cautionary tale.\nDuring his first-term of office in 2018, Trump imposed tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines after American producer Whirlpool complained about cheap South Korean competition. \nThose rivals - Samsung and LG - then set up in America, creating close to 2,000 jobs.\nBut at what price? An imported washing machine cost an American shopper almost a third more at the start of 2023, just before tariffs were abolished, than five years previously.\nAdd up the costs of tariffs and one study claims each of those jobs cost Americans the equivalent of more than $800,000 (\u00a3627,000).\nThose tariffs of course meant revenue for American governments and that source has increased dramatically in recent years, following the raft of tariffs Trump also imposed in his first term on China - most of which were retained under President Joe Biden. \nHowever, the amount netted is equivalent to a tax rise on American households of up to $300. Ultimately it is they who are footing the bill - and will continue to do so.\nThen consider the impact on American manufacturers who have businesses spanning Canada, Mexico and perhaps even China. Overall, economists think we could be looking at a hit to US growth of up to 1% - not enough to prompt a recession, but unwelcome nonetheless.\nIn sheer numbers terms, the hit to the Canadian economy could be greater, economists say. It sells more than $400bn worth of goods to America every year, accounting for a fifth of its income. \nBut it has the capacity to lower interest rates, and healthy public finances, providing policy makers with scope to cushion the blow for Canadians.\nThe damage to Mexico's national income could be less severe, but its central bank has less capacity to cut interest rates making it harder to deflect the pain.\nAll of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.\nChina, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere. \nIronically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets. \nCountries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.\nA key point about trade wars is that there are winners as well as losers - particularly for those countries outside President Trump's firing line. Vietnam and Malaysia for example saw their exports grow rapidly during President Trump's last term as they scrambled to replace China in selling to America.\nIf the UK continues to escape the wrath of President Trump, we could actually benefit from closer trading links with his country and indeed from greater foreign investment, if we looked to be a more certain environment than some of our competitors. But of course, our fate remains unclear.\nAs it stands, the prospects for global growth in 2025 have dulled, but a recession appears very unlikely. However, in Trump world we have learnt very quickly to expect the unexpected - so much still depends on what happens from here.\nAnd that uncertainty itself is harming business confidence both in the US and around the world, putting off key decisions about where to invest and create jobs. \nWeaponising uncertainty too comes at a price - even on home soil.

He said that none of this would have been possible without crews, friends and the generations of dancers that continued to flock to their dancefloors.Couldn't afford to fly so started a festival The first Celtronic Festival, Gareth said, started as \"a wild notion\" from very humble beginnings.",

        "article_text": "The rise of online auction app Vinted and people eager to find bargains has seen a rocketing rise in fashion sustainability - but one textile waste sorting centre said it has seen more garments than ever being discarded. \nSome 15,500 tonnes of clothing came through the doors at SWD Clothing site in Bolton, Greater Manchester, last year. \nThe estimated 60 million clothes come in from charity shops and local authority textile bins across the region, but there are fears a growing amount cannot be recycled.\nThe reason is thought to be the rise of so-called fast fashion, the mass production and sale of low quality and cheaply-made clothing closely following the latest trends.\nSWD Clothing said fast fashion is having a major impact on business because these garments are not designed to last as long as regular items and, by the same token, are not designed to be recycled.\nSo what happens to the clothes and what can we do to help promote better habits?\nMany people imagine most old clothes being recycled in the same way we recycle plastic but SWD said it is not that simple. Clothes listed as \"recycled polyester\" in the shops are most likely made up of recycled plastic bottles rather than old clothing.\nPeter Page, head of recycling and sustainability, said: \"It's very difficult because clothing is not designed to be recycled. It's designed to be bought, to be worn and then to be thrown away.\"\nHe explained that for textile recycling you mostly rely on single fibre materials but the use of synthetic materials in most fast fashion items makes that difficult.\nWorkers grade the clothing by quality, category and colour and the clothes need to be clean and dry to get reused or recycled.\nMr Page said that 75 per cent of the clothing that comes through the centre can be reused and is sold to wholesalers across the world.\nClothes that get sent for recycling are also used for carpet underlay, noise insulation or wiping cloths for the oil and gas industry, while new ideas are always being explored.\nThen, about three per cent of the clothes that are not fit for reuse or recycling are sent for incineration.\nSWD is getting busier every year, Mr Page said, but the quality of the clothes coming in makes it harder for them to reuse. \nQuite a lot. Among them, Valery Touchet started free classes to teach people how to sew and repurpose old clothes instead of throwing them out.\nMs Touchet said she had noticed the tradition of hand-me-down clothes she grew up with had changed to a culture of simply \"buying and throwing\".\n\"I just thought if I could educate people on how to reuse what they have already instead of buying new, that would help,\" she said.\nThe classes have brought together women from all different backgrounds, many who said they valued the \"sisterhood\" they had built as well as the new skills they have learned.\nMeanwhile, the Manchester Fashion Movement is helping to educate people about sustainable fashion by going into schools, hosting panel talks and organising pop-up exhibitions and fashion shows with an educational message.\nAlison Carlin said she wanted to \"champion local northern talent\" and send people away from her events \"with knowledge they can go on to discuss\". \nThrowing clothes into household waste bins means they are likely to end up in landfill.\nDisposing of clothes in a local authority textile bin located at recycling centres across the region or taking them to charity shops is the best way to prevent this.\nHowever, Dr Patsy Perry, reader in fashion marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) acknowledged how hard it is to be sustainable amid the temptation to buy new clothes advertised more vividly than ever online.\n\"The best thing we can do is wear what we already own,\" she said.\n\"Don't buy new things if you are only going to wear them once, and there are other solutions like charity shopping or even luxury resellers to explore.\"\nMs Touchet agreed, adding: \"Look through your wardrobe, there is always something [to recycle].\"\n\"If you don't know how to go about it, that's where I come in, to help you refashion, reuse them and repurpose. \n\"If it was a dress before we can turn it into a blouse, or a top and a skirt.\"\nA project by MMU has been collecting surplus clothing from across Greater Manchester, looking at whether the textiles are reusable, reusable but low quality, or non-reusable.\nMore than half the textiles in the sample were categorised as high-quality reusable, a small proportion were low quality but reusable, and less than a third were non reusable.\nAs part of the project, textiles that come through the Bolton sorting centre are being scanned to find out the material composition.\nThe hope is that the results will work out how many of the garments could be recycled into new textiles or other uses - in order to ensure fewer clothes go to waste.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

He came in as if he hadn't been away. It's been good to have him leading it.\"\nWales have lost a record 15 Test matches in a row with interim head coach Matt Sherratt taking over from Warren Gatland before the Ireland defeat.\nThomas happy to return to centre stage for Wales\nThe infamous game that almost killed international rugby\nScotland call up trio as Crosbie and Mann drop out\nOspreys hooker Dewi Lake is also in contention for a return after missing the first three Six Nations defeats because of an arm injury.\nLake, 25, has not played in the tournament since 2022 because of a series of injuries but impressed when captaining Wales on the summer tour of Australia and during the autumn internationals in Cardiff.\nElliot Dee and Evan Lloyd have been the hookers used by Wales during this tournament.\n\"Dewi has been excellent and it is good to have him back,\" said Jones.\n\"He's a former captain and has been a big player for Wales in the last few years.\nWales scrum coach Jones believes a couple of impressive performances from Lake could help him force his way into the British and Irish Lions trip to face Australia in the summer.\n\"He's been mentioned in certain [Lions] squads. He's got a point to prove, that's the beauty of this year.\n\"Anyone who plays well in the Six Nations has a chance to tour in the summer.\n\"There are a few boys in our squad who are in the mix and he's one of them.\"\nJones came in as a scrum consultant for the tournament after being given permission by his Harlequins club.\nThe Wales scrum impressed against Ireland with props Nicky Smith and WillGriff John given starts.\nJones says he was shocked Smith, who joined Leicester from Ospreys for the 2024-25 season, had not regularly been selected previously by Wales with Gareth Thomas consistently starting. \nSmith has made just five starts in the previous 50 Tests for Wales.\n\"I don't know why he wasn't picked, because I wasn't here, but I'm glad to have him here,\" said Jones.\n\"He's been good for us. He made his Ospreys debut with me in 2014 and been around for a while. \n\"I always remember him as a young fella. He's always been strong, like gym-strong and I've always thought he was a really good player. \n\"Going to Leicester and seeing him again, if you're a Leicester prop, you have to have that scrummaging mentality and he's got it. \n\"He's been excellent. Gareth Thomas is a massive leader off the pitch for us and around the defence and they actually balance out pretty well.\"\nSale tight-head prop John, 32, was making his first Six Nations appearance and playing his first international for more than three years.\n\"He was excellent,\" said Jones.\n\"Will is someone I was aware about years ago, coming through and he did a good job with Sale. \n\"He came back to Wales to further his chances. It didn't work out but he's a big, strong boy, probably the strongest in the squad.\n\"So I'm pleased for him. He's a lovely kid. He's been around a bit now to find his mojo.\n\"We're in a good place scrum-wise. We're still getting relationships with them, which is a big thing in coaching.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has issued what he called a \"last warning\" to Hamas to release the hostages being held in Gaza.\n\"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say,\" Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform.\nHamas accused the US president of encouraging Israel to break the ceasefire deal currently in effect between the two sides.\nTrump's statement came just hours after the White House confirmed it was holding direct talks with Hamas over the remaining hostages.\nWashington has until now avoided direct engagement with the group, and there is a longstanding US policy against having direct contact with entities it lists as terrorist organisations.\nIn his social media post, Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\" if the hostages were not released, while not specifying the nature of the support he was sending Israel.\n\"Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" he added.\n\"For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance.\"\nHe also appeared to issue a wider threat: \"Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!\"\nHamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement that such threats \"complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation [Israel] to avoid implementing its terms\".\nIt's not the first time Trump has threatened Hamas. In December, he said there would be \"all hell to pay\" if hostages were not released by the time he took office.\nThe post came after Trump met with a group of hostages in the White House who had been recently released under the ceasefire.\nMeanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the US has been negotiating directly with Hamas to try to secure the release of the hostages.\nIsrael had been consulted prior to the talks, she added.\nPresident Trump believed in doing what was in the best interest of the American people, Leavitt told reporters.\nThe work of the special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, work was a \"good faith effort to do what's right for the American people\", she added.\n\"Two direct meetings\" have taken place between Hamas and a US official, \"preceded by several communications\", a Palestinian source told the BBC.\nNews of the talks was first reported by Axios, which said the two sides were meeting in Qatar to discuss the release of US hostages as well as a wider deal to end the war.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nAt least 48,440 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael says there are still 59 hostages being held in Gaza, with up to 24 believed to be alive.  \nFive US citizens are among the captives. One of them, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive and the other four are presumed dead.\nA former US deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for the Middle East said the US needs to be \"more proactive\" about getting its citizens back.\nMick Mulroy, who is also an ex-CIA paramilitary officer, added that \"it could complicate the Israelis' ability to get their citizens back if not tightly coordinated\".\nIsrael's prime minister's office said in a statement it has \"expressed its position\" regarding the direct talks, but did not provide any further information.\nAccording to reports, Boehler met with Hamas representatives in the Qatari capital, Doha, in recent weeks.\nHamas has had a base in Doha since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration.\nThe small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia.\nAlongside the US and Egypt, Qatar has also played a major role in talks to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nAdditional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

One of them, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive and the other four are presumed dead.Watch: White House press secretary confirms US in talks with Hamas over hostagesA former US deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for the Middle East said the US needs to be \"more proactive\" about getting its citizens back.Mick Mulroy, who is also an ex-CIA paramilitary officer, added that \"it could complicate the Israelis' ability to get their citizens back if not tightly coordinated\".Israel's prime minister's office said in a statement it has \"expressed its position\" regarding the direct talks, but did not provide any further information.According to reports, Boehler met with Hamas representatives in the Qatari capital, Doha, in recent weeks.Hamas has had a base in Doha since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration.The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. \"Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" he added.",

Contacting a group designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US since 1997 represents a dramatic shift away from decades of US policy.\nThe Biden administration relied on intermediaries during its attempts to end the Gaza war.

He took to Truth Social to call it \"sick and twisted\" and issue a \"last warning\" that if members didn't release all the hostages there would be \"hell to pay\".\n\"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job,\" he wrote, \"not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say.\"\nLaura Blumenfeld, a former senior Israeli-Palestinian policy adviser to the US state department, told the BBC that Trump's message to Hamas was an ultimatum.\n\"The deal, though, with these ultimatums is you have to deliver,\" she said, \"and we saw last month when Trump said you've got a high noon deadline on Saturday, release the hostages, or else, there was no or else.\n\"And Hamas called them out.

An announcement followed this week saying that the US had suspended arms shipments, and another on Wednesday said intelligence-sharing with the war-torn nation was paused.\nTrump's actions left America's European allies rattled \u2013 and the consequences of that may not yet be fully appreciated.

        "article_text": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu \u2013 a custodian Buddhist deity \u2013 was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\u00a0\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\u00a0\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima Island\u00a0\u2013 a key stop along the way\u00a0\u2013 says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was \u2013 quite ambitiously \u2013 armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me \u2013 and other beginners \u2013 Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) \u2013 stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges \u2013 at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n\u2022\u00a0How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022\u00a0The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled Mukaishima Island.

The UK has committed \u00a37.8bn in military support during the same period.\nThe US decision to pause military aid came hours after Trump criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for saying the end of the war with Russia is \"very, very far away\".\nThe pair had an explosive spat in the Oval Office last Friday, with Trump telling Zelensky he was \"gambling with World War Three\" by refusing to consider a ceasefire without US security guarantees.\nZelensky left the White House before a proposed deal on sharing Ukrainian minerals with American companies could be signed.\nOn Monday, the White House announced it was \"reviewing\" the delivery of ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution\".\nThe order to pause all current American military aid to Ukraine takes effect immediately, and includes all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit and at depots in Poland.\nThe pause will affect more than $1bn (\u00a3790m) in arms and ammunition, including rockets, anti-tank weapons, and armoured vehicles of the kind Ukraine has relied on in its effort to repel Russian forces.\nThe pause in aid will heap more pressure on Zelensky to sign the minerals deal and agree to peace talks without the US security guarantees he has been seeking.\nRussia has tentatively welcomed the pause in US aid to Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a \"solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process\".\nFedir Venislavsky, a member of  the Ukrainian Parliament's defence committee, said his country had a weapons stockpile that would last six months \"without consistent help from the US\".\nIn an interview with Fox News, US Vice-President JD Vance said the door was open for Ukraine to return to negotiations if Zelensky was \"willing to seriously talk peace\".\nVance also drew criticism for saying that giving the US an \"economic upside in the future of Ukraine\" through the minerals deal was a better security guarantee for the country than \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". \nSo far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any eventual peace deal in Ukraine, although Sir Keir has previously said a \"number of countries\" have agreed to commit troops.\nVance did not specify which country he was referring to, but later insisted he did not \"mention the UK or France in the clip, both of whom have fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond\".\nConservative shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge had earlier accused Vance of ignoring the \"sacrifice\" of British and French troops, calling the comments \"deeply disrespectful\". \nReacting to the decision, Rayner told the BBC the Trump administration wanted Europe to step up and had been clear about its intentions to end the war in Ukraine.\nRayner said the prime minister was also \"laser-focused on getting peace\".\n\"He won't be derailed by announcements,\" Rayner told Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"He will continue that dialogue with our oldest and strongest ally, the US, and with European partners and with Ukraine.\"\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK and Europe must \"rearm faster\" following the US announcement.\nShe said: \"The news overnight that America is halting military aid to Ukraine is profoundly worrying.\"\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said the pause in aid between the US and Ukraine only helped Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nHe posted: \"I hope that Keir Starmer can use his new role to bring the two together and soon.\"\nLast week, Sir Keir met Trump at the White House, as the prime minister attempted the shape the American approach to ending the war in Ukraine.\nOver the weekend, Sir Keir hosted a summit of western leaders, as they scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under one proposal.\nBut apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.\nOn Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented a five-part plan to mobilise some \u20ac800bn (\u00a3660m) for Europe's defence and help provide \"immediate\" military support for Ukraine.\n\"This is a moment for Europe, and we are ready to step up,\" von der Leyen said.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine and are engaging with key allies in support of this effort. \n\"It is the right thing to do, and is in our interest to do so.\" ",

        "article_text": "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star. \nJust ask Lady Gaga.\nHer rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.\nTheir appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".\nAnd as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".\nWhen she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.\nOn stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.\n\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two. \n\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"\nNow 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.\n\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"\n\nThe couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.\nIn person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.\nBut on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.\n\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.\n\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'\n\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"\nIt was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.\n\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal. \n\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"\n\nThose feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem. \nCalled (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.\nShe calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.\nMayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.\nSpeaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.\n\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.\n\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"\n\nWith that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.\nOn the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".\nIn the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.\nThere's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created. \nIt all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.\n\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.\n\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.\n\"It kind of took me down.\"\n\nHow did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?\n\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.\n\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.\n\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.\n\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"\n\nIn previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.\nMayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.\n\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.\n\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"\n\nFrom the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase. \nLast summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.\nIt was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.\n\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.\n\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.\n\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"\n\nAs an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.\nBack then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.\nOver the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.\nBut the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.\nShe puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".\n\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"\nWith an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop. \n\"I stepped away from the icon. It ends with love.\"\nTop image credit: Interscope",

        "article_text": "China has set an economic growth target for this year of \"around 5%\" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.\nIts leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.\nBut the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most.\nPresident Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.\nThis follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports. \nBeijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans.\nAt the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the \"main engine and anchor\" of its economic growth.\nBeijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus. \nRepeating that is going to be much harder this year. \n\"If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics. \nBeijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges. \nOn Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to \"vigorously boost\" household demand.\n\"Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough.\"\n\"Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,\" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world.\nBeijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices. \nThe government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment.\nBeijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; \u00a3140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual \"Work Report\". \nIn a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades.\nThe hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline. \nIt also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year.\nThe government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population.\nWhether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question.\nHarsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.   \nBut China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was \"important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant\".\nInvestment in what President Xi calls \"high-quality development\", which covers high-tech industries from renewables to artificial intelligence (AI), is also expected to be a major focus.\nThe world's second-largest economy, China has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West.\nState media has already touted recent examples like DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics, both of which have caught global attention, as examples of China's \"technological progress\". \nThe success of DeepSeek in particular saw an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors. \nA commentary in the state-run Xinhua newspaper said \"China's new energy industries and overall green transition, driven by its cutting-edge technologies, will continue to be important growth drivers\". \nBut the new US levies - which come on top of tariffs from Trump's first term - could  stymie these plans, not least because they could dampen investor sentiment.\n\"The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment,\" Mr Murphy Cruise says. \"Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment.\"\nAlso on Wednesday, China announced a 7.2% increase in its national defence budget, the same rate of growth as last year.\nAdditional reporting by Jo\u00e3o da Silva",

        "article_text": "The business of the North American Toy Fair, an annual showcase of the latest in silly putty, monster trucks and board games, is fun. But this year at the convention center in New York City, tariffs were killing the vibe.\nIn February, US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on products made in China by 10%. Then last week, with little warning, he announced an additional 10% border tax, which has now come into force on Tuesday, along with tariffs on Mexico and Canada. \nIn the toy industry, which estimates that about 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China, the rapid-fire announcements have stunned businesses, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to swallow a sudden 20% rise in cost.\nThe moves are the first of what Trump has threatened will be far wider action, making it a preview of the upheaval that could be coming for companies around the world.\n\"It's the first thing we talk about and the last thing we talk about,\" toymaker Jay Foreman said this weekend from his booth at the trade show, where classic hits such as Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and K'Nex were on display.\nHis business, Basic Fun!, makes 90% of its products in China and had been planning to counter the cost of the initial 10% tariff with a mix of higher prices for customers and lower profits, both for his firm and for his manufacturing partners. \nHe presented the strategy to his board on Wednesday, ahead of the toy show, only to have to rip it up the next day, after Trump's later announcement. \nHe will have to shoulder the tariff costs for products headed to stores this spring, he said, but is now expecting to raise prices for many items by at least 10% later in the year. \n\"The reality is that tariffs will raise the cost of toys for consumers,\" he said. \"If a customer says, 'Then I can't buy it', then I can't sell it, because I can't produce to lose money.\"\nTariffs are a tax on imports collected by the government at the border and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods.\nDuring Trump's first term, China was the main target of the measures, with more than $360bn worth of products sent to the US getting hit by the measures.\nAt the time, toys and many other consumer products were spared.\nBut Trump has now applied the duties across the board, hitting almost 15% of the imports into the US each year.\nHis actions have been overshadowed by tariffs on products made in Mexico and Canada - America's top two trade partners, which have long operated under a free trade agreement with the US. \nAnd they fall short of the \"up to 60%\" tariff that Trump called for on the campaign trail last year. \nBut with the latest move, businesses say the costs are getting too big to ignore.\nThe average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, with recent actions amounting to a rise roughly twice as large as the increase during Trump's first four-year term as president, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.\n\"10% - it's something we can somehow live with. 20% is a different ball game,\" said Yaron Barlev, chief operating officer of Clixo, a Brooklyn-based maker of magnetic building toys which started about five years ago and signed a deal last year to start selling its toys at Target later in 2025.\nWith manufacturing in China now under way to satisfy that order, his firm, which employs 18 people in the US, is expecting to have to shoulder the costs of the border duties, scrambling its plans for profits.  \nHe said he hoped Trump would offer some kind of reprieve for toys but was not feeling especially optimistic.\n\"It's much less predictable now than he used to be so I really don't know.\"\nTrump has said his actions will help boost manufacturing in the US, by making it less cost-effective to make products overseas. \nBut toymakers like Clixo, which had hoped to do its manufacturing in the US, say high costs and limited manufacturing capacity in the US make that idea unrealistic.\nMeanwhile, a string of weaker economic data has raised concerns that the uncertainty due to the tariff talk is starting to cause wider economic paralysis. \nBasic Fun!, which employs about 165 people and does roughly $200m in sales each year, had been looking to grow. But with the threat of tariffs bearing down, Mr Foreman recently put plans for acquisitions on hold, unsure how to calculate what a business would be worth in such a changeable environment. \n\"[A tariff] sounds good - 'Let's stick it to them!' But the ripple effect is unbelievable,\" Mr Foreman said.\nThe Toy Association, a business lobby group, says it is trying to make the case to the White House and Congress that toys should be exempt from tariffs, as they were before, warning that higher prices won't go unnoticed by a public already upset by the jump in prices in recent years.  \nPresident Greg Ahearn said his members are largely small businesses with profit margins barely as large as the tariffs that are getting under way. \n\"We think we have a very strong point to make and we're hoping they're going to be open to listening,\" he said. \nThe Toy Fair is his organisation's marquee event, drawing businesses from around the world who line New York's convention center with cheerful displays of blocks, high-contrast baby books and spiky coloured balls. But worry about tariffs pulsed through the gathering this year.\n\"It's killing our mojo,\" said Mr Ahearn, noting that it was his members' top concern.  \nFrom their booths, toymakers greeted questions about Trump's moves with head shakes, grimaces and disbelief. \n\"20% is a lot,\" said Ada Luo, sales director for Wonderful Party, a manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, which makes Christmas light necklaces, leis and New Year's hats. \"10% maybe... between the supplier and the buyer we can share, but 20%? We don't have a clue.\"",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada, calling it a \"very dumb thing to do\" and vowed to conduct a \"relentless fight\" to protect its economy.\nTrump has imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.\nThe Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.\nBut Trump pushed even further in a post on Truth Social, saying: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nTrudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". \n\"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\"This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\"\nHe said that Canada's main goal remains to get the tariffs lifted so that they \"don't last a second longer than necessary\".\nTrump said he is protecting US jobs and manufacturing, and trying to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US president said his goal is to clamp down on the powerful opioid fentanyl; he has variously blamed the other countries for the drug's arrival in the US.\nResponding to the accusations, Trudeau said on Tuesday there was \"no justification\" for the new tariffs, because less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the US border comes from Canada. \nTrudeau's words were echoed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said there was \"no motive, no reason, no justification\" for Trump's move. Speaking on Tuesday, she too vowed to issue her own \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" - but said further details would be given on Sunday.\nTrump's tariffs are likely to push up prices for consumers in the US and abroad, said John Rogers, an economics professor at American International University.\nThe items most likely to be affected the soonest are food - the fruits, vegetables and other produce the US imports from Mexico - followed by the large amounts of oil and gas imported from Canada, Prof Rogers said.\n\"Prices could go up pretty soon\", Prof Rogers warned, though he was reluctant to say by exactly how much or how quickly. \n\"We are in pretty uncharted territory,\" he told the BBC.\nThe bigger concern for prof Rogers was the potential damage he said was being done to America's longstanding trade partners.\n\"This is kind of sticking your finger in the eye of your neighbour,\" he said, adding that, in a potential US-Canada-Mexico trade war, \"everybody is a loser\".\nThe three countries targeted are America's top trading partners, and the tit-for-tat measures also prompted fears of that very trade war. \n\"There's no way you can win a trade war. Everybody suffers, because everybody's just going to wind up paying higher prices and sacrificing quality,\" Prof Rogers said. \nTariffs are a tax on imports from other countries, designed to protect against cheaper competition from elsewhere, and boost businesses and jobs at home.\nCanada's retaliatory measures include a 25% reciprocal tariff that will be imposed on C$155bn (US$107bn; \u00a384bn) of American goods:\nCanada's Immigration Minister Marc Miller warned that as many as a million jobs in Canada were at risk if the tariffs were implemented, given how intertwined trade was between the two countries.\n\"We can't replace an economy that is responsible for 80% of our trade overnight and it's going to hurt,\" he said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency, a car manufacturing employee in the Canadian province of Ontario said people were indeed \"pretty scared\" of being laid off. \"I just bought my first house,\" Joel Soleski said. \"I might have to look for work elsewhere.\"\nThe sector is one that could be badly affected by the new tariffs regime in North America. Car parts may cross US-Canada border several times during the manufacturing process, and so might be taxed on multiple occasions.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto manufacturing industry, told reporters on Tuesday that he anticipates assembly plants will \"shut down on both sides of the border\" as a result of the tariffs.\nThe tariffs were called \"reckless\" by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whose president Candace Laing cautioned that the move would force both Canada and the US towards \"recession, job losses and economic disaster\".\nMs Laing warned they would also increase prices for Americans, and force US businesses to find alternate suppliers that she said \"are less reliable than Canadian ones\".\nCanadian provincial leaders have vowed their own responses. \nFord of Ontario mooted the possibility of cutting off Canadian electricity supplies and exports of high-grade nickel to the US, as well as putting an export levy of 25% on electricity sent to power homes in Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nCanada exports enough electricity to power some six million American homes.\nOntario and other provinces have also moved to remove US-made liquor off their shelves. In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said his province will ban American companies from bidding on provincial contracts, as will Ontario. \nFord also announced that a C$100m ($68m; \u00a355.1) contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet company Starlink will be cancelled.\nMeanwhile China - which now faces tariffs of 20% after Trump doubled an earlier levy - has vowed to fight any trade war to the \"bitter end\". It has announced its own counter-measures - including tariffs on a range of US agricultural and food products.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky travelled to Washington at the end of February expecting to sign a major deal with the US on the joint development of his country's mineral deposits. \nInstead, after an angry meeting with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, Zelensky was told to leave and the deal was left unsigned.\nThe Ukrainian president has since said he is still willing to sign it, and Trump has also indicated the deal could still be on the table. \nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine. \nThis includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.\nIt is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. \nOther elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.\nDeposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nFor instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nTrump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough.

        "article_text": "The cake is a sublime art form, involving numerous colours and flavours commingling into an oh-so-soft and delicious cake that hides a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\nThe rich, buttery aroma of kek lapis (layer cake) greets me when I walk into Seri's (short for Sharifah Zainon) small baking studio at her home near Kuala Lumpur. The alluring aroma is not surprising, given that Malaysia is gearing up to celebrate Raya, which is short for Hari Raya (the Day of Celebration in Malay), and refers to the festive occasion marking the end of Ramadan. Kek lapis is an integral part of these festivities.\nSeri puts her academic training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker. Watching her hands spreading the batter evenly on the pan, I think that baking a kek lapis is a bit like conducting a scientific experiment. Preparing this multi-layered Malaysian cake with colourful and complex patterns not only requires knowledge and skill, but also oodles of patience, an eye for precision and a steady hand.\nA degree in the sciences seems to come in handy for kek lapis bakers, seeing the elaborate designs that Karen Chai, another engineer turned baker, creates at her baking studio in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb. When Chai returned to Malaysia after studying pastry arts at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, she decided to focus on kek lapis, using her mother's recipe as a starting point. \"Learning about the science of baking has been very useful in making kek lapis,\" she said.\nThis layer cake first came to Malaysia from neighbouring Indonesia through the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo. In the mid-19th Century, Dutch colonisers introduced the plain European spit cake \u2013 made with layers of dough deposited one by one onto a cylindrical rotating spit \u2013 to the nation then known as Batavia (now Jakarta). Indonesians added local spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg and turned it into the lapis legit, often known as the thousand-layer cake.\nUpon its arrival in neighbouring Malaysia in the 1970s, Sarawakians elevated the cake to a sublime art form, involving multiple layers and numerous colours and flavours commingling into the oh-so-soft and delicious kek lapis. While the classic kek lapis often looks like a plain loaf on the outside, cutting it reveals a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\nAlso called the Sarawak layer cake, kek lapis typically has a minimum of 12 layers. The cake is created by carefully adding one thin layer of batter after another onto a baking pan every few minutes, broiling (or grilling) each layer in the oven to ensure the lower layers are never burnt. The plain version alternates light and dark strips of cake batter, whereas the coloured cakes have geometric patterns that, depending on the final pattern, can involve 20 or more layers.\nThe final cake is cooled and then cut into strips, with different pieces reassembled using thick jam or condensed milk as adhesive. Often, multiple cakes have to be baked, and pieces from each of them are assembled to create a complex pattern. This is then wrapped up in a thin cake layer of a single colour, or arranged between two sets of plain (ie, with no colours or patterns) multi-layered cakes.\nIf all this sounds confusing, then imagine what it is like for the baker. Even the most experienced of them first draws these patterns on paper, clearly marking out sizes and colours, after which they get to work with the batter. A complex design can take up to eight hours to complete, with several chances for error at every step in the assembly process.\nChai explains that as opposed to other complex layered cakes, it is particularly tough with kek lapis, since the error often becomes apparent only after the baker has finished assembling the pieces, \"so all the hard work goes down the drain\".\nShe then shows me photos of her mother's signature 16-piece design that was born out of an error in calculation. \"She baked a few extra layers by mistake and didn't want to throw those pieces away. She just cut that up and tried to form another block, and this design came out. So this is not something that you will find from other bakers,\" she said.\nBoth Seri and Chai say that the long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of seeing a perfectly executed design. \"But there are no short cuts,\" Chai warned. Indeed, seeing Seri at work, cutting and sticking these long strips together with a generous lashing of raspberry jam, brings to mind a complicated jigsaw puzzle slowly taking shape. \"It's like therapy, [but] it's also fun and creative\" she said.\nWhen I visited in mid-February, the bakers had been working non-stop for weeks, fulfilling Raya orders received through their social media channels. Back in their hometowns in Sarawak, kek lapis is part of every holiday celebration, including Chinese New Year, Raya, Christmas and the midyear harvest festival of Gawai Dayak, cutting across communal and religious boundaries.\nSeri's long-term client and self-professed cake lover, Farazaila Wahet, said, \"This is an anytime cake for me, but of course for Raya, it is a must.\" The Sarawak native, who moved to Kuala Lumpur more than 10 years ago, said that the satisfaction she gets from kek lapis is unparalleled, because \"the texture is heavier and the taste is richer compared to any other cake.\"\nKek lapis is available in many flavours, such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, red velvet and pandan (a tropical plant with a strong aroma, commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking). Even popular malted drinks like Horlicks and Milo are used for flavouring. And now, artisanal bakers like Seri and Chai are trying to modernise this traditional cake to make it relevant to younger generations, while also staying true to the original recipe.\nSeri, for instance, makes exquisite chocolate batik art on the top layer to make her cakes even more attractive. \"Batik is traditional to Malaysia, so is kek lapis, and I love to combine the two to create this new version,\" she said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A multi-layered cake from India\n\u2022\u00a0Norway's best cake\n\u2022\u00a0The centuries-old baba made with 96 egg yolks\nChai keeps experimenting not just with more complicated patterns, but also new ingredients and flavour pairings. In the past, she has created gluten-free kek lapis using coconut flour with peanut butter topping, and another unique version with fig, apricot and cinnamon.\nBaking a good kek lapis requires a lot of time and high-quality ingredients, which means that they are also expensive, with prices going up to RM300 (roughly \u00a350) or more for a square, one-kilogram cake. But thankfully for the small-batch bakers, this traditional cake is constantly in demand from individual clients and it's also gaining in popularity as corporate gifts and wedding favours.\nThese bakers are on a mission to maintain this Sarawak culinary tradition, despite all the long hours and thin margins. As Seri said, \"Every time I make a kek lapis, it feels like a piece of home to me.\"\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n---\u00a0\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",
