        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Back pain is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, but an AI-powered app is being used to help patients in the UK to manage their symptoms. But how does it measure up?\nWhen I hurt my back in October 2024, the cause wasn't immediately clear. Perhaps, something went awry while hoisting one of my young nephews in the air. Or, more likely, I messed my back up while lifting a bed so my wife could slide a rug underneath.\nWhatever the trigger, my overconfidence in my own strength left me with a lower back injury. Days later, the pain began radiating down the sciatic nerve in my left leg. Standing was fine, sitting was torture. In order to sleep, I had to slide a pillow underneath my legs to keep the downward-pulsing shockwaves at bay.\nBy mid-December, I saw a pain medicine specialist in the area of Washington, DC where I live. He ran some movement tests, sent me for X-rays, and wrote me a referral for physical therapy with a diagnosis of \"lumbar radiculopathy\". In the United States, this is a relatively quick process \u2013 I went from pain to starting treatment in about three months. But that's still a very long time for something so common \u2013 and debilitating \u2013 as lower back pain.\nSince early January, I have seen human physical therapists who work wonders. Once a week, I go in, discuss my pain, get a soft-tissue massage, and do well-supervised exercises and stretches. My pain isn't gone, but it's finally under control.\nI specified that these physical therapists are human because, well, I've also been seeing a new physio in the UK. But my new British physio is only partly human. Rather, she's a series of pre-recorded videos made by a real physiotherapist, powered by artificial intelligence that I can access via an app on my phone.\nThe service, provided by a company called Flok Health, is the first artificial intelligence clinic \u2013 of any kind \u2013 to be trialled by the UK's National Health Service (NHS). It's been approved for use by the country\u2019s Care Quality Commission as a registered healthcare provider, and began seeing patients \u2013 just like me \u2013 at the end of 2024.\nThe reason: a lot of people suffer from lower back pain and struggle to get access to the care they need. As of September 2024, nearly 350,000 people in England alone were on waiting lists for treatment for musculoskeletal problems \u2013 the longest of all waitlists for any set of conditions. The UK government reported that 23.4 million work days were lost in 2022 alone due to these untreated problems, implying an enormous economic as well as human cost. Globally, lower back pain is a leading cause of disability and affects an estimated 223 million people worldwide.\u00a0\nFlok's promise is to start seeing patients immediately, relieve the burden on the NHS, and head off patients' back pain before they go untreated and deteriorate. It's a noble mission, but I had one question: Was AI really the answer?\nIn addition to being a trained doctor, Finn Stevenson spent time as a professional rower in Great Britain's Olympic development programme. Anyone who has rowed before \u2013 or even spent time on a rowing machine at a gym \u2013 knows that the sport can be an incredible workout but also brutal on the back if your form isn't perfect. While a professional athlete, Stevenson had access to top doctors and physiotherapists who could treat his ailments immediately. But when he left rowing and his back pain flared up, he realised what it's like for everyone else trying to receive care.\n\"It was quite a big shock in terms of what access to care looked like for 99.5% of people,\" says Stevenson, now Flok's chief executive. \"In theory, I should be pretty well placed to manage this. I had an academic background, I'd had three years of professional physio. If I was struggling, other people probably were too.\"\nStevenson and Ric da Silva, now his co-founder and Flok's chief technology officer, met when they were early employees at a company called CMR Surgical, a British startup where the pair worked on building robotics for soft-tissue surgery.\u00a0\nBut with Flok, they are aiming to provide treatment to people who don't need surgery. They are looking to help people with the easiest and most manageable cases.\u00a0\n\"There are quite a few conditions where that's true, where you don't need a scan, you don't need hands-on manipulation, you don't need medication,\" says da Silva. \"What you need is 10 minutes of stretches a few times a week, and that will solve the problem.\"\nThe idea is that this should then free up clinicians to focus on the patients with more complex problems who really need their help.\nWhen I first open Flok, I'm greeted by Kirsty, my physiotherapist. She appears in a minimalist setting with all of the accoutrements befitting a yoga instructor: black workout outfit, bamboo-coloured exercise mat, contemporary office chair, and a Monstera plant. She asks me questions about myself and my pain, and I respond by clicking multiple-choice options. Each response triggers a follow-up question or instruction as the underlying AI adapts to my answers.\nBut rather than being a live video call, this interaction is a series of pre-recorded video that are stitched together by AI based on my answers.\u00a0\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom of the past few years has been spurred by advances in generative AI from large language models, Flok has a different use for AI. \"We essentially developed a domain specific language for describing clinical reasoning,\" says Stevenson. Because it's not a ChatGPT-like chatbot predicting the next word in a sequence, there isn't a risk of the so-called hallucination problem in AI where an algorithm makes things up \u2013 a major concern about AI in the medical field.\nInstead, this AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion \"intervention combinations\", says Stevenson. The power of AI makes it possible to deliver this in a seamless way.\nIt's a \"perfect software problem\", says Stevenson. \"Software is an extremely good delivery model if you know what you're trying to deliver, and if you just need to do that in a more scalable way.\"\nFlok is currently expanding its operations. Its service launched first in Scotland at the end of last year and has recently signed contracts to add locations in England, though Stevenson isn't yet able to reveal where. In the next 12 months, Stevenson said he hopes to cover at least half of the UK. And they're also expanding what pain areas they're treating hip and knee osteoarthritis and women's pelvic health.\u00a0\nBut it is also not alone in trying to use AI to tackle musculoskeletal pain. Another AI-based app that helps patients manage pain in the lower back and neck called selfBACK has been undergoing clinical trials in the US as an add-on to more typical care services.\nNot entirely unlike Flok's approach, selfBACK works by analysing what treatments worked well for previous patients with similar conditions, then recommending personalised exercise plans. Studies have indicated that it can help to reduce pain among those who use it. But a recent trial found slow adoption rates \u2013 nearly one-third of trial participants never used the app, and another third only used it a few times. Patients and practitioners concluded that the app should be used to supplement traditional care rather than replace it. Other studies have also cautioned that self-management apps need to be provided in addition to care not as a replacement.\nEven so, research seems to suggest that mobile health apps of this nature are a potentially promising approach to helping patients manage their back pain. But there are also no shortage of questions about AI's integration into healthcare more broadly. Elizabeth A. Stuart, a professor and chair of the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that AI healthcare tools should undergo the same rigorous evaluations as traditional medical interventions, such as regulatory approvals and peer review.\n\"In some ways, these AI tools are no different from other healthcare interventions that we want to learn about the effects of,\" says Stuart. \"We need to assess how well they work, do they work, who do they work for, just as carefully as we have done for other healthcare interventions.\"\u00a0\nStuart says that while we don't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to AI, we do need to recognise when these systems keep evolving even after they're deployed. \"With some AI tools, they are sort of self-adapting,\" she says.\nShe contrasts AI tools with the annual flu vaccines, which undergo deliberate assessment processes each year to ensure they're targeted to the latest viral strain. But sometimes AI tools are a black box, \"changing under the hood\" in real-time and it's not always clear how, she says.\u00a0\nPranav Rajpurkar, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, says he sees promise in AI applications that help triage care for patients. \"What's counterintuitive is that forced collaboration between AI and clinicians often underperforms compared to a clear division of labor,\" he says. \"When doctors and AI review the same cases side-by-side, their combined accuracy is sometimes barely better than doctors alone. Clean separation of responsibilities side steps these issues.\"\nIn Flok's case, the company employs professional physios who appear in the videos that patients see, but are available to answer patient questions after their AI-enabled video sessions.\nRajpurkar predicts that eventually \"we'll move from narrow AI tools to generalist medical AI systems capable of handling multiple tasks across different domains\". It's an approach he's working on with his own company, a2z Radiology AI, which is developing AI-powered analytics for radiologists.\n\"The systems that succeed won't be those claiming to 'replace doctors', but those that thoughtfully redistribute clinical work to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and human-centered,\" says Rajpurkar.\nIn our first 20-minute session, Kirsty asks me a long list of questions about myself, about my pain, and asks me to stretch in different ways \u2013 following her careful lead on the screen \u2013 in order to decide the best course of treatment. She gives me stretches and exercises to try for the week ahead, with careful instruction not to push too hard or do anything that feels uncomfortable.\u00a0\nThis isn't the experience I have in-person with my team of human physical therapists in the US. They frequently correct my posture and tell me when I'm doing something wrong \u2013 which is often. The big difference here is that Kirsty can't see me. Her pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches. They rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss. There's also an option at the end of the session to leave a voice note for a real physiotherapist who will respond to my personal needs or questions \u2013 a real voice behind the curtain.\nMy back felt better after my sessions with Flok, but the app likely isn't for me. I'm clumsy and uncoordinated and need someone watching my form at all times \u2013 if not, I'm likely to hurt myself further. That ability to watch patients and offer feedback on posture could be something AI will enable in the future \u2013 but until then, I'll be sticking with the humans.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Some people scrub them every day while others say letting water run over them in the shower is enough. So are you cleaning these important appendages enough?\nWhen you jump into the shower and reach for the soap and loofah, it's fair to say that certain body parts probably receive more attention than others. The underarm region no doubt gets the full lather, rinse, repeat treatment. Your feet, by virtue of being located at the end of your body, can be easy to overlook. However, according to some experts, your feet are just as, if not more, deserving of attention.\nBoth the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and US Centre for Disease Control (CDC), for example, advise washing feet daily with soap and water. One reason for this meticulous care is to prevent odour. The soles of the foot contain 600 sweat glands per square centimetre of skin, more than any other region of the body. \u00a0Although sweat itself doesn't smell, it contains a nutritious broth of salts, glucose, vitamins and amino acids, which serves as an all-you-can-eat buffet for bacteria that live there. And there a lot of bacteria.\n\"The foot \u2013 especially between the toes \u2013 is quite a moist, humid, and warm environment, so it can be a breeding ground for microbes,\" says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull in the UK. This is exacerbated by the fact that most people encase their feet in socks and shoes, trapping the moisture inside.\nIf you zoom in on any square centimetre of human skin you will find between 10,000 to one million bacteria living there. Warm and moist areas of the skin, such as the feet, are considered prime real estate and are home to the greatest numbers of species. Feet are idyllic havens for Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus bacteria, for example. When it comes to fungi, your sweaty feet are considered a utopia to genera including\u00a0Aspergillus (a pathogen often found in soil), Cryptococcus, Epicoccum, Rhodotorula, Candida (a kind of yeast which naturally lives on the body but can become an opportunistic pathogen), Trichosporon and others. In fact, the human foot contains a greater biodiversity of fungal species than any other body region.\nThis is probably a good reason to clean your feet. In one study, researchers swabbed the soles of 40 volunteers. They found that foot washing had a significant impact on bacteria numbers. People who washed their feet twice a day had around 8,800 bacteria living in each square centimetre of skin. Those who reported washing every other day had over one million bacteria per square centimetre.\nHowever just because the soles of your feet are brimming with microbial life, that doesn't mean that they are necessarily smelly or that there is anything to worry about. As always, it's not just the number, but the type of bacteria that's important.\nStaphylococcus are the key players when it comes to producing the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) responsible for foot odour. Sweat glands on the skin of the feet release a heady mix of electrolytes, amino acids, urea and lactic acid. The Staphylococcus bacteria consider this a veritable feast and, in the process of feeding, convert amino acids into VFAs. The main chemical culprit is isovaleric acid, which has an unpleasant odour which has been described as having a \"distinct cheesy/acidic note\". The comparison is apt, as many cheeses contain a similar mix of volatile chemicals.\nIn one 2014 study, researchers swabbed the feet of 16 subjects and found that 98.6% of the bacteria present on the soles of the feet were Staphylococci. The levels of VFAs, including the key foot odour compound isovaleric acid, were also significantly increased on the sole of the foot compared to the bridge (top) of the foot. Overall, the study concluded that the intensity of foot malodour was correlated to the total number of Staphylococcus present \u2013 another reason to reach for the soap.\u00a0\nHowever, washing your feet isn't just about preventing cheesy foot odour. Many diseases and foot problems can be prevented through good foot hygiene.\n\"Because of the small space between the toes, these areas are particularly at risk for microbial\u00a0infections,\" says Joshua Zeichner, associate professor of dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. \"This can lead to itching, swelling, and a foul smell. As the skin barrier becomes disrupted, this can also increase\u00a0the risk of microorganisms invading the\u00a0skin and causing more significant soft tissue infections known as cellulitis,\" he says.\u00a0\nAccording to Zeichner, the most common problem is the development of athlete's foot, which is a superficial fungal infection of the skin on the feet.\u00a0The fungi that cause athlete's foot thrive in warm, dark, and moist environments \u2013 hence why this condition most commonly affects the spaces in-between the toes. Keep this area clean and dry and you deprive the fungi of their perfect home. This is a good thing, as athlete's foot can cause a series of unpleasant symptoms such as itchiness, a scaly rash, flaky skin and cracking on the soles of your feet and between your toes.\nKeeping your feet clean could also prevent skin infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas bacteria. While these bacteria exist naturally on your skin, if they get into your bloodstream via a cut then it can lead to a serious infection. Even a minor staph infection can lead to boils\u00a0\u2013 bumps of pus that form under the skin around hair follicles or oil glands.\n\"The feet are more prone to infections because there's quite a lot of biomass of bacteria there, and also if you do have cracks or injuries to your feet, it tends to heal much more slowly than other areas of the body,\" says Wilkinson. \"In a situation like that, there's a greater chance that if you have an injury, pathogens could get into that wound, populate and overgrow.\"\nYou might also like:\nWhile skin infections can still occur if you have good foot hygiene, regularly washing your feet reduces the number of bacteria present. So, if you happen to get a cut, there will be less microbes around to get into the bloodstream.\nFrequent foot washing is especially important if you suffer from diabetes, a condition that makes people prone to ulcers and skin infections. Research has shown the feet of diabetic patients contains a higher proportion of pathogenic bacteria residing on the skin.\u00a0\n\"They are there waiting for an opportunity to cause an infection. So, it's really important that people with diabetes are keeping on top of their foot hygiene, because they're at more risk of developing infection because of that,\" says Wilkinson.\nTo make matters worse, people with diabetes also have an impaired immune response, so if they do get an infection, their body can't fight it off. Diabetes patients are also prone to cuts, wounds, and sores in the feet that don't heal. If these aren't caught early, then toes, feet, or even limbs may need to be amputated.\n\"If you have uncontrolled diabetes, you may have damage to the nerves in your feet, so you can't feel your feet properly,\" says Wilkinson. \"Just the act of washing allows you to properly check your feet for any minor abrasions or dryness that might contribute to having an infection.\"\nFor that reason, Wilkinson \u2013 and charities such as Diabetes UK \u2013 recommend that diabetes patients wash their feet every day.\nBut what about everyone else? Some experts argue that for most people, washing the feet every day has little health benefit, and can even raise the risk of skin problems.\nAfter all, the skin relies on its community of helpful microbes to perform essential functions. They repel harmful bacteria, produce lipids that keep the skin hydrated and supple, and even help repair wounds. Intensive washing and scrubbing can remove these beneficial species, especially if the water is hot. As a result, skin can become dry, irritated, or itchy. Cracked skin may allow bacteria to breach the usually impenetrable skin barrier, increasing the likelihood of infections.\n\"Overwashing the skin can disrupt the skin barrier, stripping the skin of natural oils, contributing to dryness and inflammation,\" says Zeichner.\u00a0This leads to itchy, dry skin and can exacerbate conditions like eczema.\n\"It is also important not to overly scrub or exfoliate the skin on the feet,\" says Zeichner. \"Calluses develop because of daily trauma. But they actually protect the feet from the environment.\u00a0Removing calluses\u00a0takes away that protection.\"\nThere is also a concern that antibacterial soaps could upset the delicate balance of microorganisms on the skin, killing the beneficial species and allowing the emergence of hardier, pathogenic strains that are resistant to antibiotics. Finally, our immune system needs to be challenged to a certain extent by microbes in order to do its job. If we don't come into contact with a steady stream of bacteria and viruses in childhood, then our bodies don't learn how to properly respond to attack. Some experts believe that bathing or showering too frequently could actually be counterproductive for you for this very reason.\nSo that leaves us with the perennial question, how often should we wash our feet? The answer depends to some extent on the individual.\n\"For people with diabetes, it is 100% advised that you wash your feet every day,\" says Wilkinson. \"But if you don't have any underlying conditions, then dermatologists tend to advise that every couple of days is more than enough to maintain good hygiene, without stripping too much of the natural oils on your skin.\"\nHowever, Wilkinson points out that if you're somebody likes to run or work out at the gym, then you will obviously need to wash your feet more regularly than somebody who is less active. It's also not just the frequency of washing that's important either. How you wash and dry your feet also has health implications.\n\"A lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't \u2013 you need to actually physically wash your feet with soapy water,\" says Wilkinson.\nHowever, according to Dan Baumgardt, a GP and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol in the UK, the most important thing he stresses to patients is to make sure you dry your feet properly. \"When you've got wetness or dampness in between the toes that's allowed to just remain there in a warm environment, that's when you're prone to developing things like athlete's foot and other fungal infections,\" says Baumgardt.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

So Jon was almost the opposite, he's been quite slack about what the players can do both on and off the pitch.\n\"I think Edwards has the best of both. She has that balance of making sure players are accountable on and off the field, but also bringing in some fun and understanding that players are not robots. She can recognise the moments when they need that breathing space.\" \nWorld Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley also backed Edwards for the job and described her as a \"brilliant, outstanding coach\". \n\"She'll really get hold of this team and she'll know how to make the standards better so they can compete under pressure,\" Hartley said.\n\"She gives you free rein to work out things for yourself but doesn't take any nonsense and that is what England need right now.\"\nThe potential candidates are not as clear regarding England's next captain, though Nat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely option having been Knight's deputy with many, including both Greenway and Hartley, naming off-spinner Charlie Dean as a contender.\n\"It has been one of the biggest downfalls over the past five or six years that there isn't a standout candidate to take over,\" Hartley added.\n\"They need a coach who can get the culture right, control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room, and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Bears' South African centre Janse van Rensburg then collected Byrne's high kick-off and raced through the visitors' defence to score the fifth try in 10 minutes.The tit-for-tat try scoring then cooled with Bears getting consecutive tries for the first time in the match when Williams touched down for his second from another quick Bears line-out move, securing his side their first bonus point.Jenkins' pick and go kept Exeter in it and made it 26-19 with 20 minutes played.Bates crossed for the second time eight minutes later, with Exeter's England centre Henry Slade then failing a head injury assessment after being hit hard by Bears number eight Viliame Mata in the build up.Hodge secured Exeter a bonus point when he scored a try from his own chipped ball and Rob Baxter's side received a further boost when Grondona was sent off for catching Moloney's face with his head.However, being a man down seemed no problem for Bears as Randall sniped over to take the score to 40-24 at half-time.Following the highest scoring first half in the league's history, Bears firmly pulled away at the start of the second as back row replacement Steve Luatua rode tackles from Richard Capstick and Will Rigg to power over.Bates then completed his hat-trick thanks to the intuition of scrum-half Randall's quick tap penalty and incisive running, which had caused chaos for the Chiefs defence throughout the match.That proved to be the end of the hosts' scoring, although Exeter grabbed consolation tries through substitute hooker Jack Yeandle and centre Rigg to take Chiefs' try tally up to six and 14 in total.

I am sorry, it's my decision, and I accept that decision,\" said Crisafulli.\nThe government had toyed with plans to redevelop the Gabba - which was built in 1895 and has staged 67 men's Test matches - but those plans were scrapped following a 100-day review into planning for 2032.\nCricket, which is being held in Los Angeles in 2028 and is likely to be retained in 2032, could be played at the Gabba before the arena is torn down. \n\"Wouldn't it be amazing to see the Australian cricket team win gold at an Olympic final? The Gabba's swansong,\" Crisafulli said. \n\"The Gabba is at its end of life. It hasn't been well maintained, and we do need a stadium to host this great show, and there is an opportunity for legacy play.\"\nQueensland Cricket backed the plans, with chief executive Terry Svenson saying the arena had been a \"wonderful venue\" but its challenges were \"well documented\". \nA new 25,000-seater national aquatic centre will be built in Spring Hill near the main stadium, while a new 20,000-seater arena is planned near the main athletes village. \nThe rowing will be held in Queensland's Fitzroy River, which is known to host saltwater crocodiles but the government says the waters are safe.\n\"If it's good enough for central Queensland kids, I reckon it's good enough for Pierre from Paris,\" said Crisafulli. \nThe Brisbane Queensland Tennis Centre will receive significant upgrades in order to host tennis events. \nThe Gabba first staged a Test match in 1931 \nSpeaking to BBC World Service, ABC reporter Arianna Levy said the plans to build a stadium in Victoria Park are controversial because the site holds \"cultural significance\" to Aboriginal people. \n\"It really has come as a political backflip,\" said Levy on Tuesday.\n\"It's been really polarising for a lot of the community here in Queensland.\n\"The main stadium in Victoria Park, which will host 63,000 seats, it's one of the few green sites across Brisbane and it holds cultural significance to the Indigenous people of Brisbane, the Turrbal people. They call the place the Barrambin. \n\"It was a native camping ground and food-gathering place. It had First Nations people from across Queensland gather all over the place for corroboree, which is the traditional dance for First Nations people. \n\"There were protests today. There were communities that were against the development of the park to turn it into a stadium. We do imagine in the days to come there will be fallout from community groups and stakeholders that feel like this plan is not the best plan going forward.\"",

        "article_text": "It's a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\nIn 2007, I was a recent newcomer to Houston, a humid Texas city on the Gulf of Mexico that felt as foreign to me as if I had moved around the globe. Unsurprisingly, this incredibly diverse city was teeming with international culinary influences. There was Mexican food from across the border; fresh Vietnamese flavours brought by refugees in the 1970s; and New Orleans-style food from people who moved here after Hurricane Katrina. Middle Eastern food was everywhere too, from vast emporiums stocked with brined olives, tabbouleh and vats of hummus to street vendors serving freshly made kebabs. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\nA take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. But what sets the sandwich apart is its creator: Jalal Antone, the Louisiana-born, Texas-raised son of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. His version of a chow chow recipe had a bold Middle Eastern influence, swapping out traditional mustard and celery seeds for paprika and turmeric, giving the relish a striking orange hue and a deeper, spiced complexity.\nAntone dreamed of starting a Middle Eastern import store but was unsure of how it would be received by Houstonians at the time. In 1962, he finally opened Antone's Import Company on Taft Street, selling imported spices, olives, hummus, falafel and tabouli. At the time, most of Houston's half a million residents were unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food. To win them over, he devised a simple but effective solution: a sandwich.\u00a0\n\"Houstonians were eating burgers in those days,\" explains Craig Lieberman, CEO of Antone's. \"The story is that he asked his friends 'How do I sell a product to Houstonians?' They said, 'Come up with a chow chow recipe and put that on your sandwich'.\"\nAntone sourced French bread from a local bakery, layered it with his imported meats and cheeses and added his signature spiced chow chow. The result? A sandwich that became a Houston staple.\u00a0\nBy the late 1960s, Antone's had become a wild success, with people flocking there from far and wide. A postcard dating from Antone's early years describes the store as a \"tempting world of foreign foods\" while a 1965 Houston Chronicle article notes that the store was stocked with cheeses, olives, eels and even squid pickled in their own ink. But what kept people coming back were the sandwiches.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nRestaurant critic Alison Cook remembers eating the affordable, filling Antone's Original sandwiches as a student at Rice University in 1966, describing the experience in a 2017 Houston Chronicle article. \"It was founded to cater primarily to the local Syrian and Lebanese community, but the po' boys made it a mecca for Houstonians of all stripes. To my impressionable 19-year-old brain, the rambling Antone's space was an exotic wonderland, chockablock with foodstuffs from the Middle East and beyond, festooned with sausages and crammed with cheeses I'd never heard of. In a city where steakhouses, seafood palaces and Italian American spots ruled the dining scene, Antone's pointed the way to a wider world.\"\nThrough the 1970s and 80s, the Houston po' boy cemented itself as a local lunchtime staple, on par with tacos and barbecue. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born. Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.\n\"Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,\" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. \"These were really adventurous flavours for people at the time. The story of how they moved forward by creating something unique is why they've lasted so long.\"\nAlthough Antone's original import store is long gone, the Houston po' boy lives on.\u00a0Antone's Famous Po' Boys\u00a0still has two locations in Houston \u2013 one inside\u00a0The Galleria, the city's massive megamall, and another in the\u00a0Heights\u00a0neighbourhood, where you can grab a sandwich alongside Lebanese tabouli and dolmas.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the banh mi the world\u2019s best sandwich?\n\u2022\u00a0The sweet Dutch sandwich that makes no sense\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nIf you can't make it to a sandwich shop, Antone's po' boys are sold in grocery stores across Texas, including\u00a0H-E-B,\u00a0Randall's,\u00a0Kroger, and\u00a0Brookshire Brothers. They're even stocked in hospital cafes and at Texan universities like\u00a0Baylor\u00a0and\u00a0The University of Texas. If you're looking for a taste of Antone's at home, their proprietary chow chow can be bought by the jar at local supermarkets along with their pickles.\nThough Houston's food scene continues to evolve, the po' boy remains a symbol of the city's culinary melting pot \u2013 a sandwich born from Middle Eastern ingenuity, shaped by Southern tradition and beloved by generations of Houstonians.\n\"I can't tell you how many Texans grew up on Antone's,\" says Lieberman. \"We still use the same bread from Royal Bakery and the same recipes that Jalal created; it's a very nostalgic and beloved Texas brand.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.Antone's Famous Po' BoyAntone\u2019s po\u2019 boys are also sold at the groundbreaking Antone\u2019s nightclub in Austin, which brought the blues to Texas (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\"Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,\" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.A take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born.",

So Jon was almost the opposite, he's been quite slack about what the players can do both on and off the pitch.\n\"I think Edwards has the best of both. She has that balance of making sure players are accountable on and off the field, but also bringing in some fun and understanding that players are not robots. She can recognise the moments when they need that breathing space.\" \nWorld Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley also backed Edwards for the job and described her as a \"brilliant, outstanding coach\". \n\"She'll really get hold of this team and she'll know how to make the standards better so they can compete under pressure,\" Hartley said.\n\"She gives you free rein to work out things for yourself but doesn't take any nonsense and that is what England need right now.\"\nThe potential candidates are not as clear regarding England's next captain, though Nat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely option having been Knight's deputy with many, including both Greenway and Hartley, naming off-spinner Charlie Dean as a contender.\n\"It has been one of the biggest downfalls over the past five or six years that there isn't a standout candidate to take over,\" Hartley added.\n\"They need a coach who can get the culture right, control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room, and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on US imports from countries that purchase oil from Venezuela.\nTrump described the move as a \"secondary tariff\" aimed at punishing the Latin American country \"for numerous reasons\", including allegedly \"purposefully\" sending gang members to the US.\nSeparately, Trump suggested he was softening his plans for tariffs on imports from other countries, saying he \"may give a lot of countries breaks\".\nMarkets ended the day higher after the comments, which appeared to confirm reports that he was narrowing the taxes he plans to announce on 2 April. \nTrump has previously said he was looking to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries around the world, outlining plans for a system whereby \"they charge us, we charge them\".\nBut on Monday he suggested the White House might be \"nicer than that\" when it came to the new tariff rates.\n\"We may take less than what they're charging because they've charged us so much, I don't think they could take it,\" he said, while also acknowledging that some countries might be spared from the measures.\nLeading share indexes in the US, which have fallen steeply in recent weeks following Trump's tariff threats, all rose on Monday. \nThe S&P 500 closed 1.7% higher, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.2% while the Nasdaq finished 2.2% ahead.\nTariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by the company that is buying the goods as opposed to the overseas business that is selling the product. \nSince taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly used tariffs - or the threat of them - in an attempt to gain leverage in a range of disputes, only some of which are related to trade. \nHe said on Monday he still planned to impose tariffs on specific products, including cars, lumber and computer chips, claiming the possibility of such measures were already helping to spur investment in the US. \nHis latest threat against Venezuela is expected to raise pressure on current buyers of oil - which include China, India and Spain - to reduce their dealings in the country, which have provided a critical financial lifeline to the Venezuelan government. \nTrump has already raised tariffs on Chinese imports to at least 20% since February.  He told reporters he intended the latest announcement to be added on top of existing levies.\nFor Venezuela, China is a major buyer of its oil.

The US is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, as a result of exemptions from economic sanctions granted to US oil firm Chevron. Trump has previously said he was looking to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries around the world, outlining plans for a system whereby \"they charge us, we charge them\".But on Monday he suggested the White House might be \"nicer than that\" when it came to the new tariff rates. He told reporters he intended the latest announcement to be added on top of existing levies.For Venezuela, China is a major buyer of its oil. \"We may take less than what they're charging because they've charged us so much, I don't think they could take it,\" he said, while also acknowledging that some countries might be spared from the measures.Leading share indexes in the US, which have fallen steeply in recent weeks following Trump's tariff threats, all rose on Monday.",

He later got a degree in biology from the University of Western Ontario and a Bachelor of Laws from York University's Osgoode Hall Law School.\nSingh worked as a criminal defence attorney for years before pursuing provincial politics, eventually running provincially for a seat in the Ontario legislature in 2011.\nIn 2019, he won his first seat in Canada's parliament in by-election - or special election -  in Burnaby, British Columbia, east of Vancouver.\nThe former human rights activist ran on pledges to forgive student loan debt, to drastically reduce Canada's carbon emissions and to ensure universal prescription drug coverage. \nHe has found a large audience on TikTok and is also known for his style and well-tailored suits, with BuzzFeed once calling him the \"most stylish politician in Canada by like a million kilometres\".\nHe is married to fashion designer Gurkiran Kaur Sidhu, with whom he has two children.

It can be used as an aid.

It might be asking AI to give feedback or help structure their CV.\n\"Maybe it's asking AI to help read a cover letter that they have already written to help refine it and help it sound a little bit more eloquent.\"\nUltimately the job interview process required applicants to ensure \"what makes them unique is able to shine through\", she added.\nStudent Jasmine James, 18, said she was avoiding using AI for her university work.\n\"I feel like it's too much of a risk, with plagiarism and stuff like that,\" she said.\n\"But I can understand why people do use it, because it is a quicker and easier alternative. \n\"I just feel like the information isn't always correct, so it's best to avoid it for uni work.\"\nFellow student Jacob Morgan, 19, said he believed AI could be a \"really helpful tool\".\n\"I use it a lot, especially instead of Google.

        "article_text": "Hovland's victory was his seventh on the PGA Tour\nFamed sport psychologist Bob Rotella constantly reminds his clients that golf is not a pursuit anyone can perfect.\nBut it is a game that still attracts more than its share of perfectionists. Characters such as Viktor Hovland, who dragged himself from apparent golfing oblivion to become the latest winner on the PGA Tour.\nThis out of the blue success was an astonishing turnaround of form and fortune.\n\"It's like you keep drowning and you're running out of air,\" the 27-year-old Norwegian said of his recent travails after beating Justin Thomas in the Valspar Championship last Sunday to land yet another European victory on American soil this year.\nHovland's late surge secures Valspar Championship victory\nEngland's Mansell wins maiden DP Tour title\nEngland's Rhodes holds nerve to claim maiden LET victory\nIt is fair to say Hovland's success was among the least expected in a series of 2025 wins that will surely cheer European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald. This was the Oslo born star's first win since the 2023 Tour Championship.\nThen he was ranked the fourth best player on the world, someone who possessed an unorthodox but highly effective swing and who had solved his problems around the green, seemingly the only aspect holding him back.\nIn short, he looked a complete player, one ready to start winning majors and capable of becoming a dominant figure. The finished article.\nYet, there is no such thing in this game. The pursuit for better never ends and capriciously it brings no guarantees of improvement.\nThere are those who say \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  Rory McIlroy used that very phrase talking about aspects of his own game in the wake of his recent play-off win at the Players Championship.\nBut Hovland most certainly does not fall into that category.\n\"I find it kind of weird that we're professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, 'oh he's a perfectionist, he's out on the perimeter searching too much',\" he commented.\n\"That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments. So if you're not going to try to get better, what are you doing?\"\nThis from a player who had the world at his feet, only to then make a string of swing changes while emulating the Watford FC approach to hiring and firing coaches.\nIn the 574 days that followed his Tour Championship victory, Hovland slumped from first to 137th on the tour's FedEx Cup standings. He had missed the cut in his previous three outings, including starting the Players with a ruinous 80.\nBut the golfer believed the constant tinkering, the pursuit of perfection, to be entirely justified. \"It's not like I'm inventing stuff,\" he said.\nBut what he did realise was that he needed to go back to feels and methods that had previously worked. \"I have data that can show that what I used to do was objectively better than what I'm doing now.\n\"So why shouldn't I try to go back to what I used to do?\"\nHe reconnected with former coach Grant Waite while still pondering whether it was worth heading to Tampa for the tournament he ultimately won. \"I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week,\" Hovland admitted.\nBetween them they found an old feel on the range last Tuesday. It had been lost in pursuit for more speed and its rediscovery was a vital building block.\n\"He's really hard on himself,\" Hovland's caddie Shay Knight told PGATour.com. \"But as soon as he finds some little swing cue or thought, he tends to take it on board, and it happens really fast.\n\"And it just seemed to click; I knew something special was going to happen this week with the swing thought.\"\nHovland was far from perfect and still fearful of losing long shots high and right, but he had a foundation to make him competitive. \"Incredibly, I did make it work and was able to win and I think that is something that I'm extremely proud of,\" he smiled.\nThe game remains \"more stressful than it should be\" but he feels reuniting with Waite, a former tour player, will lead to more success.\n\"He's definitely put his heart and soul into looking at all the different golf swings that I've sent him,\" Hovland said.\n\"It's challenging because I have a very unique pattern and it's unconventional and I would say most coaches probably would like to make my swing more conventional and hopefully try to fix the problem.\n\"But that's not really how my golf swing works. And I really trust Grant, because he he sees it and knows what kind of matchups need to be there for it to work.\"\nHovland's win follows two PGA Tour victories for Northern Ireland's McIlroy already this year as well as big wins for Swede Ludvig Aberg, Austria's Sepp Straka and Belgium's Thomas Detry.\nThese results fuel optimism for a successful Ryder Cup defence for Europe at Bethpage in September. But do not get carried away.\nBack in 2023 Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Sam Burns were posting victories at this time of year, while Brooks Koepka, Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman landed majors. But the US team were soundly beaten in Rome.\nThere are no guarantees in the sport that Rotella, who has advised a string of major winners, insists is not \"a game of perfect\".  So it should not be a surprise that even Hovland's short-term hopes for next month's Masters are tempered.\n\"Some of the shots that I'm hitting, it's going to make it really difficult for me to be in contention at Augusta,\" he admitted.\n\"You're going to hit so many long irons into par-four holes and you've got to drive it pretty far because the fairways are pretty wide.\n\"It's more of a bomber's paradise versus this place (Copperhead in Tampa) where it's more just about being precise off the tee.\n\"So there's still some things that I need to improve, but luckily we've got two weeks and this is certainly nice to have in the back of my mind leading up to Augusta.\"",

So Jon was almost the opposite, he's been quite slack about what the players can do both on and off the pitch.\n\"I think Edwards has the best of both. She has that balance of making sure players are accountable on and off the field, but also bringing in some fun and understanding that players are not robots. She can recognise the moments when they need that breathing space.\" \nWorld Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley also backed Edwards for the job and described her as a \"brilliant, outstanding coach\". \n\"She'll really get hold of this team and she'll know how to make the standards better so they can compete under pressure,\" Hartley said.\n\"She gives you free rein to work out things for yourself but doesn't take any nonsense and that is what England need right now.\"\nThe potential candidates are not as clear regarding England's next captain, though Nat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely option having been Knight's deputy with many, including both Greenway and Hartley, naming off-spinner Charlie Dean as a contender.\n\"It has been one of the biggest downfalls over the past five or six years that there isn't a standout candidate to take over,\" Hartley added.\n\"They need a coach who can get the culture right, control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room, and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Hundreds of people have taken part in the largest anti-Hamas protest in Gaza since the war with Israel began, taking to the streets to demand the group step down from power.\nMasked Hamas militants, some armed with guns and others carrying batons, intervened and forcibly dispersed the protesters, assaulting several of them.\nVideos shared widely on social media by activists typically critical of Hamas showed young men marching through the streets of Beit Lahia, northern Gaza on Tuesday, chanting \"out, out, out, Hamas out\".\nPro-Hamas supporters defended the group, downplayed the significance of the demonstrations and accused the participants of being traitors. Hamas is yet to comment.\nThe protests in northern Gaza came a day after Islamic Jihad gunmen launched rockets at Israel, prompting an Israeli decision to evacuate large parts of Beit Lahia, which sparked public anger in the area.\nIsrael has resumed its military campaign in Gaza following nearly two months of ceasefire, blaming Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal to extend the truce. Hamas, in turn, has accused Israel of abandoning the original deal agreed in January.\nHundreds of Palestinians have been killed and thousands displaced since Israeli military operations resumed with air strikes on 18 March.\nOne of the protesters, Beit Lahia resident Mohammed Diab, had his home destroyed in the war and lost his brother in an Israeli airstrike a year ago.\n\"We refuse to die for anyone, for any party's agenda or the interests of foreign states,\" he said.\n\"Hamas must step down and listen to the voice of the grieving, the voice that rises from beneath the rubble - it is the most truthful voice.\"\nFootage from the town also showed protesters shouting \"down with Hamas rule, down with the Muslim Brotherhood rule\".\nHamas has been the sole ruler in Gaza since 2007, after winning Palestinian elections a year prior and then violently ousting rivals.\nOpen criticism of Hamas has grown in Gaza since war began, both on the streets and online, though there are still those that are fiercely loyal and it is hard to accurately gauge how far support for the group has shifted.\nThere was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals.\nMohammed Al-Najjar, from Gaza, posted on his Facebook: \"Excuse me, but what exactly is Hamas betting on? They're betting on our blood, blood that the whole world sees as just numbers.\n\"Even Hamas counts us as numbers.

There was no communication from them until 11:00 and even this it was only that they could take us back on Monday, which would involve an eight hour stay at Heathrow.\n \"If you didn't want the flight you had to phone a number that took forever to get through, but I suspect it was a minor inconvenience compared to some.\"\nLess fortunate was Liz Steele, who missed her youngest son Paddy's graduation in Stirling on Friday.\nShe told BBC News: \"It was devastating. \n\"I know that there are people that have been affected much worse than this, but I've been to every other graduation that my kids have had, Masters and undergrads, and I just always thought that I would be there.\"\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye denied the incident - caused by a transformer catching fire within the North Hyde electrical substation - had made the airport a \"laughing stock\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"We have other substations but to switch them in takes time.\n\"The situation was not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences.\" \nA spokesperson for British Airways said around 85% of its services would be able to fly today.\nOn social media Heathrow Airport advised all passengers to check flights in advance before travelling.",

In 2018, the country banned the platform for a month while authorities attempted to root out fake profiles. At the time, authorities mooted the idea of a state-run alternative. \nIn 2023 Papua New Guinea launched a parliamentary inquiry into \"fake news, bad news reporting and social media [platforms]\" in the country.",

        "article_text": "At a secret location away from prying eyes, Ukrainian engineers test a long-range drone called Raybird.  \nThe machine, which looks like a mini plane with wings, is placed on a launchpad, stretched like an arrow on a crossbow and then shot into the air.\nRaybird can fly non-stop for more than 20 hours and cover a distance of more than 1,000km (620 miles). It carries out reconnaissance missions, and can also destroy targets both on the frontline and deep inside Russia.\nAmong their targets are oil refineries and fuel depots.\nBut after Russia and Ukraine reached separate agreements with the US on a partial ceasefire, missions like these should stop.\nAs well as agreeing to a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea following talks this week in Saudi Arabia, the two countries committed to stop attacking each other's energy infrastructure \u2013 something that had theoretically already been agreed.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would implement these agreements immediately.\nHowever, Oleksiy from Skyeton, the company that develops the Raybird, doubts that Moscow would adhere to the ceasefire.\n\"[Russians punch you in the face, then the next day they make an agreement but ask to tie up your hands. So the possibility that they will continue fighting remains,\" explains Oleksiy.\nYet, this deal will also bring relief to Russia.\nIt's estimated that this year alone, Ukraine carried out more than 30 attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure using drones and other weapons. \nThey've recently hit some of the country's largest oil facilities, like the Ufa oil refinery about 1,500km (932 miles) from the front line and Tuapse plant in Krasnodar region.\nRussia's oil refining capacity has dropped by about 10% as a result of drone attacks, according to Reuters.\nAnd Moscow's recent decision to extend the ban on petroleum exports shows that they're feeling the pain.\nUkraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. President Zelensky recently announced that Ukrainian engineers have designed a drone that has a range of 3,000 km (1,860 miles). That means it could reach not only Moscow, but even locations in Siberia.\nKyiv also claims that it has developed turbojet powered \"missile-drones\". They fly at a much higher speed and so are harder to intercept.\nZelensky said Ukraine has successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic weapon and upgraded its cruise missile Neptune to hit ground as well as naval targets. This missile was reportedly used to attack the Russian air base in the southern city of Engels last week, although Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny these reports.\nThe energy ceasefire deal is certainly good news for Ukraine too. Russia has been relentlessly targeting its power plants and stations across the country. At one point last year, Ukraine's energy generation capacity dropped to a third of its pre-war level.\nLast month, when temperatures dropped below zero, Russian drones hit a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. A few days later, another massive aerial attack left more than 250,000 residents of Odesa without power and heating.\nAnd lately, there has been a growing number of attacks on Ukraine's gas infrastructure. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.\nMoscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.\nAt the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.\nAnd if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.\nBack at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field. \nOleksiy is satisfied with the results. He says that although it's good to have a ceasefire, they still cannot afford to pause their work and the development of new weapons.\n\"Our enemy just wants to have a break, gather its strength and attack again,\" he says. \"We must be ready for that.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump revoked security clearances from his previously defeated Democratic election rivals, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, as well as a number of other former officials and critics.\nTrump said in February he was revoking security clearance for his predecessor Joe Biden. His order confirmed that decision, adding that he was also revoking the security clearance of \"any other member\" of the Biden family. \n\"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump's memorandum read. \nFormer US presidents and top security officials usually keep their security clearance as a courtesy. \nTrump ordered department and agency leaders to \"revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities for these individuals.\"\n\"This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress,\" the order stated.\nFor several named figures, the loss of access to classified material and spaces will have a more symbolic impact. \nIt may limit the materials they are able to review, or restrict access to some government buildings or secure facilities.\nThe lawyers and prosecutors named by Trump, however, could potentially face roadblocks in accessing or reviewing information for their cases or clients.\nTrump's revocations focus on top Biden administration officials, as well as prominent political critics and attorneys who have challenged Trump or his allies in court.\nBiden's secretary of state Antony Blinken, national security advisor Jake Sullivan, and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco all lost their clearances.\nTrump also targeted two of his own former officials from his first term: Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman, who testified during his first impeachment trial that began in 2019.\nTrump also revoked access for high-profile Republican critics, former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\nThey were the only two Republican lawmakers who joined a US House investigation into Trump's role in the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress.\nBoth also voted to charge Trump in his second impeachment, which a Democratic-led US House of Representatives instigated after the riot. Trump was acquitted by the Senate on the charge of inciting the 6 January riot.\nTrump has also singled out top legal opponents in his latest decision on security access. His order revoked clearance for New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought multiple lawsuits against Trump and his businesses. \nIn a civil fraud lawsuit that concluded in 2024, a judge found Trump liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. Trump is appealing the decision.\nManhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who prosecuted and won Trump's criminal hush money case last year, also lost his clearance.\nTrump's legal targets went beyond elected prosecutors. He withdrew security clearance for Norm Eisen, an attorney leading multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. \nAndrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who joined an investigation of Trump during his first term and later provided media commentary about the hush money trial, also lost his clearance.\nPrevious media reports had indicated that the administration had pulled the security clearance for a top whistleblower attorney in Washington, Mark Zaid.\nFriday's order listed him among the individuals who would lose access. \nHowever, Mr Zaid told the BBC that \"despite being told three times that my clearance has been revoked, I still have not received anything formally.\"\nHe claimed losing his security clearance would harm \"the federal employees, including Trump supporters, who count on me to handle cases few other lawyers could.\"\nSeveral of the individuals chosen by Trump derided his order in social media statements.\n\"I don't care what noises Donald Trump makes about a security clearance that hasn't been active for five years,\" Mr Vindman wrote on X.\nMr Eisen wrote on X that being targeted by Trump's order \"just makes me file even more lawsuits!\" \nTrump had earlier pulled security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials whom he accused of meddling in the 2020 election in Joe Biden's favour. He provided no evidence for these claims.\nIn February, Trump announced he was revoking Biden's security access. In a social media post, Trump said Biden \"set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents\".\nIn 2021, Biden - serving as president at the time - barred his defeated rival Trump from having access to intelligence briefings citing his \"erratic behaviour\".\nA 2024 Justice Department special counsel report found Biden had improperly retained classified documents from his time as vice president. The report noted that Biden had cooperated with federal investigators and returned the discovered documents.\nIn 2023, Justice Department special prosecutor Jack Smith indicted Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents following his first term in office and obstructing their return to the government.\nTrump pleaded not guilty and a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. Smith officially dropped the case that December after Trump won re-election.",

Since then, South Korea has been led by deputy prime minister Choi Sang-mok.\nSouth Korea has been roiled by political chaos since Yoon's botched attempt to impose martial law.\nShortly after assuming the role of acting president, Han blocked the appointment of new judges to the constitutional court - something the opposition had hoped would improve the odds of Yoon getting impeached. \nAs a result, they voted to impeach Han. \nBut on Monday, the judges ruled seven to one to strike down the impeachment. \n\"I thank the constitutional court for its wise decision,\" Han said after the ruling was announced. \"I will work to bring the government to order.\"\nSouth Korea remains on tenterhooks for another upcoming decision by the same court - on the impeachment of President Yoon. \nLawmakers voted to impeach Yoon on 14 December, but it is ultimately up to the constitutional court to decide.\nIf the court votes to uphold the impeachment, Yoon would be immediately removed from office and South Korea must hold a presidential election within 60 days.

He noted that opposition lawmakers have filed several impeachment motions, and the court has dismissed the nine cases it has ruled on so far.\n\"Reinstating Han is also partly political theatre setting up its more consequential ruling on Yoon's impeachment.\" Dr Easley added.\n\"Mostly siding with conservatives on Han's case can be seen as a play for unity and legitimacy\" for when the court votes on Yoon's fate in coming days, he said.",

But despite their strength, few foundations today could last as long as Venice's. \"Concrete or steel piles are designed [with a guarantee to last] 50 years today,\" says Alexander\u00a0Puzrin, professor of geomechanics and geosystems engineering at the ETH university in Zurich, Switzerland. \"Of course, they might last longer, but when we build houses and industrial structures, the standard is 50 years of life.\"\nBuilding to last\nOnly once, early on in his career, Puzrin has been asked to provide a guarantee of 500 years for a construction a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple in Israel.\n\"I was kind of shocked because this was unusual,\" he recalls. \"I was really scared, and they wanted me to sign. I called my boss in Tel Aviv, a very experienced, old engineer and I said, 'What are we going to do? They want 500 years.' He answered, '500 years? [pause]. Sign.' None of us is going to be there.\"\nThe Venetian piles technique is fascinating for its geometry, its centuries-old resilience, and for its sheer scale. No-one is exactly sure how many millions of piles there are under the city, but there are 14,000 tightly packed wooden poles in the foundations of the Rialto bridge\u00a0alone, and 10,000 oak trees under the San Marco Basilica, which was built in 832AD.\n\"I was born and raised in Venice,\" says Caterina Francesca Izzo, environmental chemistry and cultural heritage professor at the University of Venice. \"Growing up, like everyone else, I knew that underneath the Venetian buildings, there are the trees of Cadore [the mountain region next to Venice]. But I didn't know how these piles were placed, how they were counted and knocked down, nor the fact that the battipali\u00a0(literally the 'pile hitters') had a very important profession. They even had their own songs. It is fascinating from a technical and technological point of view.\"\u00a0\nThe battipali would hammer down the piles by hand, and they would sing an ancient\u00a0song\u00a0to keep the rhythm \u2013 a haunting and repetitive melody with lyrics that praise Venice, its republican glory, its Catholic faith, and declare death to the enemy of the time, the Turks. On a more lighthearted note, a Venetian expression still in use today, na testa da bater pai (literally 'a head that is good to pound down the piles') is a colourful way of saying that someone is dull or slow-witted.\nThe piles were stuck as deep as possible, until they couldn't be pounded down any further, starting at the outer edge of the structure and moving towards the centre of the foundations, usually driving nine piles per square metre in a spiral shape. The heads were then sawn to obtain a regular surface, which would lay below sea-level.\nTransverse wooden structures \u2013 either zatteroni (boards) or madieri (beams) \u2013 were placed on top. In the case of the bell towers, these beams or boards were up to 50cm (20in) thick. For other buildings, the dimensions were 20cm (8in) or even less. Oak provided the most resilient wood, but it was also the most precious. (Later on, oak would only be used to build ships \u2013 it was too valuable to stick in the mud.) On top of this wooden foundation, workers would place the stone of the building.\nThe Republic of Venice soon began protecting its forests to provide sufficient wood for construction, as well as for ships. \"Venice invented sylviculture,\" explains Nicola Macchioni, research director at the institute for bioeconomy at Italy's National Council for Research, referring to the practice of cultivating trees. \"The first official sylviculture document in Italy is indeed from the Magnificent Community of the Fiemme Valley [to the north-west of Venice], dating from 1111AD. It details rules to exploit the woods without depleting them.\"\nAccording to Macchioni, these conservation practices must have been in use years before they were written down. \"That explains why the Fiemme Valley is still covered by a lush fir forest today.\" Countries such as England, however, were facing wood shortages by the middle of the 16th Century already, he adds.\nVenice is not the only city relying on wooden piles for foundations \u2013 but there are key differences that make it unique. Amsterdam is another city partially built on wooden piles \u2013 here and in many other northern European cities, they go all the way down until they reach the bedrock, and they work like long columns, or like the legs of a table.\n\"Which is fine if the rock is close to the surface,\" says Thomas Leslie, professor of architecture at the University of Illinois. But in many regions, the bedrock is well beyond the reach of a pile. On the shore of Lake Michigan in the US, where Leslie is based, the bedrock could be 100ft (30m) below the surface. \"Finding trees that big is difficult, right? There were stories of Chicago in the 1880s where they tried to drive one tree trunk on top of another, which, as you can imagine ended up not working. Finally, they realised that you could rely on the friction of the soil.\"\nThe principle is based on the idea of reinforcing the soil, by sticking in as many piles as possible, raising substantial friction between piles and soil. \"What's clever about that,\" says Leslie, \"is that you're sort of using the physics\u2026 The beauty of it is that you're using the fluid nature of the soil to provide resistance to hold the buildings up.\" The technical term for this is hydrostatic pressure, which essentially means that the soil \"grips\" the piles if many are inserted densely in one spot, Leslie says.\nIndeed, the Venetian piles work this way \u2013 they are too short to reach bedrock, and instead keep the buildings up thanks to friction. But the history of this way of building goes back further still.\nThe technique was mentioned by 1st-Century Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius; Romans would use submerged piles to build bridges, which again are close to water. Water gates in China were built with friction piles too. The Aztecs used them in Mexico City, until the Spanish came, tore down the ancient city and built their Catholic cathedral on top, Puzrin notes. \"The Aztecs knew how to build in their environment much better than the Spanish later, who have now huge problems with this metropolitan cathedral [where the floor is sinking unevenly].\"\nPuzrin holds a graduate class at ETH that investigates famous geotechnical failures. \"And this is one of these failures. This Mexico City cathedral, and Mexico City in general, is an open-air museum of everything that can go wrong with your foundations.\"\nAfter more than a millennium and a half in the water, Venice's foundations have proved remarkably resilient. They are not, however, immune to damage.\u00a0\nTen years ago, a team from the universities of Padova and Venice (departments ranging from forestry to engineering and cultural heritage) investigated the condition of the city's foundations, starting from the belltower of the Frari Church, built in 1440 on alder piles.\nThe Frari belltower has been sinking 1mm (0.04in) a year since its construction, for a total of 60cm (about 24in). Compared with churches and buildings, belltowers have more weight distributed on a smaller surface and therefore sink deeper and faster, \"like a stiletto heel\", says Macchioni, who was part of the team investigating the city\u2019s foundations.\nCaterina Francesca Izzo was working on the field, core drilling, collecting and analyzing wood samples from underneath churches, belltowers and from the side of the canals, which were being emptied out and cleaned up at the time. She said that they had to be careful while they were working on the bottom of the dry canal, to avoid the wastewater sporadically gushing from the side pipes.\nThe team found that throughout the structures they investigated, the wood was damaged (bad news), but the system of water, mud and wood was keeping it all together (good news).\nThey debunked the common belief that the wood underneath the city doesn't rot because it's in an oxygen-free, or anaerobic, condition \u2013 bacteria do attack wood, even in absence of oxygen. But bacteria action is much slower than the action of fungi and insects, which operate in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, water fills up the cells that are emptied out by bacteria, allowing wooden piles to maintain their shape. So even if the wooden piles are damaged, the whole system of wood, water and mud is held together under intense pressure, and is kept resilient for centuries.\n\"Is there anything to worry about? Yes and no, but we should still consider continuing this type of research,\" says Izzo. Since the sampling 10 years ago, they hadn't collected new ones, mainly because of the logistics involved.\nIt's not known for how many more hundreds of years the foundations will last, says Macchioni. \"However, [it will last] as long as the environment remains the same. The foundation system works because it is made of wood, soil and water.\" The soil creates an oxygen-free environment, the water both contributes to that and maintains the shape of the cells, and the wood provides friction. Without one of these three elements, the system collapses.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, wood was completely replaced by cement in foundation construction. In recent years, though, a new trend of building with wood has gained increased interest, including the rise of wooden skyscrapers. \"It's kind of the cool material right now, and for really good reasons,\" comments Leslie. Wood is a carbon sink, it's biodegradable and thanks to its ductility, it's considered among the most earthquake-resistant materials.\n\"We can't of course build entire cities on wood nowadays because we are too many on the planet,\" adds Macchioni, but it's undeniable that without artificial materials and without motors, ancient builders just had to be more ingenious. Venice is not the only city with wooden foundations, but it is \"the only one [where the friction technique was used] en masse that is still surviving today and is so insanely beautiful\", adds Puzrin. \"There were people out there who didn't study soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, and yet they produced something we can only dream about producing, which lasted so long. They were amazing, intuitive engineers who did exactly the right thing, taking advantage of all these special conditions.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

and what the Blues have proved time and time again in their dominance of domestic women's football.\nCuthbert's injury-time header completed a comeback 2-1 win at Etihad Stadium after a below-par first-half display left them a goal behind and in danger of a first Women's Super League loss this season.\nInstead they remain eight points clear in top spot - and on course for a sixth successive league title with five games left - after a second win in three titanic tussles with City over the past week.\n\"This is a team of champions - Chelsea found a way,\" ex-England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis told BBC One.\nA four-game mini-series, which first had Chelsea lifting the Women's League Cup, will conclude on Thursday at Stamford Bridge when the Blues try to overturn a 2-0 deficit from their Champions League quarter-final first leg at City.\nThat defeat ended their 31-game unbeaten run and, having bounced back impressively at City, Sonia Bompastor's side will remain convinced they can stay on course to win that elusive first Champions League trophy.\nBut will Chelsea fight back, or can City, under interim boss Nick Cushing, stay in control and triumph in the fourth meeting of the rivals in 13 days?\nBBC Sport takes a look at the intriguing battle so far.\nGame 1: Chelsea 2-1 Man City (Women's League Cup final)\nGame 2: Man City 2-0 Chelsea (Champions League quarter-final first leg)\nGame 3: Man City 1-2 Chelsea (Women's Super League)\nGame 4: Thursday, 27 March (Champions League quarter-final second leg)\nThis video can not be played\nChelsea come from behind to snatch win from Man City in injury time\nThe first part of this gripping story - the League Cup final - was decided by three scrappy goals, but Wednesday's outing at Joie Stadium was decided by two moments of quality from City substitute Vivianne Miedema.\nBack to form after returning from knee surgery in January, the Netherlands forward provided the ruthlessness which her side badly needed in the cup final defeat.\nWinger Kerolin was City's main attacking outlet for much of the European tie on Wednesday, causing problems down the right as she teed up Miedema's second.\nAnd the 25-year-old Brazilian opened the scoring in Sunday's game three in wonderful fashion, running from the halfway line and wrongfooting Millie Bright before squeezing a finish through the Chelsea captain's legs.\nBut her chances were limited in the second period as Chelsea forward Johanna Rytting Kaneryd made a greater impact at the other end, with her pace and trickery getting the better of Gracie Prior as she set up Chelsea's equaliser for striker Aggie Beever-Jones.\nCuthbert was influential when she came off the bench, piling pressure on City's midfield with determined tackles and intense pressing, before a diving header for the winner in added time.\nIt was a bold move from City to replace Gareth Taylor with former boss Cushing in the week of a cup final but, after Wednesday\u2019s Champions League victory, it seemed inspired.\nCushing won the WSL, Women's FA Cup and three League Cups in seven years at City before leaving in 2020 for MLS side New York City FC.\nAnd he has made an instant impact on his return, with his side dominating possession for large parts in all three games and looking solid defensively.\nThey have also impressed going forward - a major achievement considering top scorer Khadija Shaw and key winger Aoba Fujino have been sidelined by injury.\nFormer City midfielder Izzy Christiansen described 'game two' as a \"tactical masterclass\" from Cushing, with his substitutes after half-time - including Miedema -  making the difference.\nBut it was Bompastor's changes, and perhaps a motivational team talk, that saw them show up in the second half on Sunday to wipe out City's one-goal lead.\nBrown-Finnis said: \"They changed their tactical approach and moved Wieke Kaptein higher up, and then the players that came off the bench just showed the depth they have.\"\nBompastor said she reminded her players of the gameplan, adding: \"I told them I want to see more belief going into the second half.\"\nCity's efforts weren't helped by an injury to influential midfielder Yui Hasegawa, while Spain defender Leila Ouahabi started on the bench and keeper Ayaka Yamashita was replaced by Khiara Keating in the line-up with a problem expected to keep her out for a few weeks.\nMidfielder Laura Blindkilde Brown was also added to the list of long-term absentees, watching from the sidelines on crutches after an injury in training earlier this week, while keeper Aya \n\"I think you saw one team that was bringing their key players on, and one team that was having to take their key players off,\" reflected Cushing.\nThis video can not be played\nChelsea will have to be perfect - Cuthbert on Man City second leg\nBut it's not over yet.

        "summary": "\"This is a team of champions - Chelsea found a way,\" ex-England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis told BBC One.A four-game mini-series, which first had Chelsea lifting the Women's League Cup, will conclude on Thursday at Stamford Bridge when the Blues try to overturn a 2-0 deficit from their Champions League quarter-final first leg at City.That defeat ended their 31-game unbeaten run and, having bounced back impressively at City, Sonia Bompastor's side will remain convinced they can stay on course to win that elusive first Champions League trophy.But will Chelsea fight back, or can City, under interim boss Nick Cushing, stay in control and triumph in the fourth meeting of the rivals in 13 days?BBC Sport takes a look at the intriguing battle so far.The story so farGame 1: Chelsea 2-1 Man City (Women's League Cup final)Game 2: Man City 2-0 Chelsea (Champions League quarter-final first leg)Game 3: Man City 1-2 Chelsea (Women's Super League)Game 4: Thursday, 27 March (Champions League quarter-final second leg)Which players have been key so far?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Chelsea come from behind to snatch win from Man City in injury timeThe first part of this gripping story - the League Cup final - was decided by three scrappy goals, but Wednesday's outing at Joie Stadium was decided by two moments of quality from City substitute Vivianne Miedema.Back to form after returning from knee surgery in January, the Netherlands forward provided the ruthlessness which her side badly needed in the cup final defeat.Winger Kerolin was City's main attacking outlet for much of the European tie on Wednesday, causing problems down the right as she teed up Miedema's second.And the 25-year-old Brazilian opened the scoring in Sunday's game three in wonderful fashion, running from the halfway line and wrongfooting Millie Bright before squeezing a finish through the Chelsea captain's legs.But her chances were limited in the second period as Chelsea forward Johanna Rytting Kaneryd made a greater impact at the other end, with her pace and trickery getting the better of Gracie Prior as she set up Chelsea's equaliser for striker Aggie Beever-Jones.Cuthbert was influential when she came off the bench, piling pressure on City's midfield with determined tackles and intense pressing, before a diving header for the winner in added time.Bompastor v CushingImage source, PA MediaIt was a bold move from City to replace Gareth Taylor with former boss Cushing in the week of a cup final but, after Wednesday\u2019s Champions League victory, it seemed inspired.Cushing won the WSL, Women's FA Cup and three League Cups in seven years at City before leaving in 2020 for MLS side New York City FC.And he has made an instant impact on his return, with his side dominating possession for large parts in all three games and looking solid defensively.They have also impressed going forward - a major achievement considering top scorer Khadija Shaw and key winger Aoba Fujino have been sidelined by injury.Former City midfielder Izzy Christiansen described 'game two' as a \"tactical masterclass\" from Cushing, with his substitutes after half-time - including Miedema -  making the difference.But it was Bompastor's changes, and perhaps a motivational team talk, that saw them show up in the second half on Sunday to wipe out City's one-goal lead.Brown-Finnis said: \"They changed their tactical approach and moved Wieke Kaptein higher up, and then the players that came off the bench just showed the depth they have. The final part awaits on Thursday and Chelsea have it all to do if they are to make it to the semi-final of the Champions League, where either holders Barcelona or Wolfsburg await.Having lifted the League Cup, the WSL title is within touching distance and they are in the Women's FA Cup semi-finals, but Bompastor's main priority this season is the one trophy the club has not won in their history.Even with City's injury problems, they have quality, and Chelsea know a \"perfect game\" will be necessary. \"City's efforts weren't helped by an injury to influential midfielder Yui Hasegawa, while Spain defender Leila Ouahabi started on the bench and keeper Ayaka Yamashita was replaced by Khiara Keating in the line-up with a problem expected to keep her out for a few weeks.Midfielder Laura Blindkilde Brown was also added to the list of long-term absentees, watching from the sidelines on crutches after an injury in training earlier this week, while keeper Aya \"I think you saw one team that was bringing their key players on, and one team that was having to take their key players off,\" reflected Cushing.The most important one still to come\u2026This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Chelsea will have to be perfect - Cuthbert on Man City second legBut it's not over yet. \"We've got to believe. \"Related topicsFootballWomen's Football",

        "article_text": "Residents in an Essex town have raised concerns about potential disruption caused by an electricity infrastructure project.\nPeople living in Linford, near Tilbury, said plans to move some pylons and build a new substation could make it \"very difficult\" for locals to get around.\nNational Grid has proposed to build a new substation between Southfields and Linford, as part of the Norwich to Tilbury project.\nThe organisation said the changes would remove the need for 4.5km (2.8 miles) of underground cabling, adding it was committed to engaging with residents.\nNational Grid wants to install 114 miles (180km) of pylons between Norfolk and Essex to carry electricity produced by offshore wind farms.\nFollowing public consultation, it has revealed proposed changes to the plan, which include building a new substation 5km (3.1 miles) north of the existing Tilbury substation and moving some pylons further south.\nThe organisation said this would avoid extending Tilbury substation and remove the need for underground cabling in the area. It also planned to take down some pylons and station them further south, away from areas like Linford.\nA consultation for the proposed changes is open for another few weeks.\nPeter Clark, 69, has lived in his house in Linford for 38 years and said the updated plan would be \"more beneficial\" for locals, with the pylons in particular being moved further away.\nHowever, the retiree warned that if the project overran it could clash with other large-scale works, adding it would \"make it very difficult for people to operate their lives in general\".\nThe proposed Lower Thames Crossing is also meant to be built just to the west of Linford, under latest plans.\nMr Clark said it was \"inevitable\" that the area would see more infrastructure because it is one of the least developed parts of Thurrock. He pointed out that most building had previously been closer to the M25.\nHe also cast doubt over the impact any public consultation would have on the final Norwich to Tilbury plans, adding: \"Whatever I say will never be taken into consideration.\"\nBen Pearce, 43, moved to Linford eight years ago and said the town had a \"great community feel\" and the area was \"perfect for raising a young family\".\nBut he was worried the plan, along with other projects, could mean the benefits of the quiet town \"could be taken away in 10 years\", with the disruption due to construction being his main concern.\nMr Pearce, whose house backs on to fields where two pylons will now be moved, said the potential travel disruption was the biggest area of concern, with the town only having one road to get in and out. \nThe service centre manager added that while he would attend a consultation meeting, residents felt they were being ignored.

It also planned to take down some pylons and station them further south, away from areas like Linford.A consultation for the proposed changes is open for another few weeks.Tom Larsen-Wright/BBCPeter Clark said he supported green energy but was worried National Grid would not complete the works on timePeter Clark, 69, has lived in his house in Linford for 38 years and said the updated plan would be \"more beneficial\" for locals, with the pylons in particular being moved further away.However, the retiree warned that if the project overran it could clash with other large-scale works, adding it would \"make it very difficult for people to operate their lives in general\".The proposed Lower Thames Crossing is also meant to be built just to the west of Linford, under latest plans.Mr Clark said it was \"inevitable\" that the area would see more infrastructure because it is one of the least developed parts of Thurrock. \"Tom Larsen-Wright/BBCFive pylons near Southfields and Linford will be replaced by eight pylons further south, according to the National Grid plansBen Pearce, 43, moved to Linford eight years ago and said the town had a \"great community feel\" and the area was \"perfect for raising a young family\".But he was worried the plan, along with other projects, could mean the benefits of the quiet town \"could be taken away in 10 years\", with the disruption due to construction being his main concern.Mr Pearce, whose house backs on to fields where two pylons will now be moved, said the potential travel disruption was the biggest area of concern, with the town only having one road to get in and out. He pointed out that most building had previously been closer to the M25.He also cast doubt over the impact any public consultation would have on the final Norwich to Tilbury plans, adding: \"Whatever I say will never be taken into consideration. \"Residents can contribute to the public consultation until\u00a023:59 on\u00a017\u00a0April.Follow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.More on this story'Tweaks' proposed to Tilbury-Norwich pylon plansFinal pylon consultation gets under wayCross-country pylons 'cheapest and quickest' optionRelated internet linksNational GridRenewable energyNational GridEast TilburyEssex",

After periods of introspection and self-analysis, Bellamy the coach is a different person, one who prides himself on his composure and analytical eye.\nPlayers have talked of his considered team talks and detailed tactical presentations; his interviews with the media have been measured, thoughtful and wide-ranging.\nBut in North Macedonia on Tuesday night, when Wales bundled in an added-time equaliser after a conclusion of stupefying drama, that cool veneer disappeared in an instant.\nAs David Brooks' shot crept over the line, an ecstatic Bellamy leapt in the air and roared with delight. His feet had barely touched the ground when he was asked to summarise his feelings.\n\"My main reaction? Probably shock, still,\" he said.\n\"Calm? Not at all. Even now, I'm not. I thought it would have been difficult to accept losing today. But you have to accept certain things as much as you don't want to.\n\"As a coach you try to teach the players.

If I look at the game, we were in control but football can find a cruel way sometimes.\n\"Maybe because I haven't suffered defeat in a short reign but I still felt there was something more.\"\nThis was Bellamy's eighth game in charge of Wales and he still hasn't lost yet, with four wins and four draws leading to Nations League promotion and a solid start to World Cup qualifying.\nHis frustration was understandable in Skopje.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMeet the man who convinced Nike to take a gamble on Michael Jordan\nThere were 15 seconds left on the clock when a 19-year-old college basketball player launched a 16-foot winning shot that would change sports marketing forever.  \nWatching that day was marketing executive and grassroots promoter Sonny Vaccaro. He was so impressed by what he saw that two years later he would bet his job at sports manufacturer Nike on backing this relatively untested player.\nThat player was Michael Jordan.\nBut not the Jordan we know now. At the point Vaccaro witnessed him score the shot that won the 1982 NCAA championship for North Carolina Tar Heels, Jordan was                 just a freshman.\nWhen, two years later, Vaccaro urged his bosses to spend their whole yearly basketball endorsement budget on him, Jordan was only 21 and had never competed in the NBA. And no-one was talking about his footwear.\nVaccaro says his conviction in the youngster's potential was forged the moment he watched him take that shot at the Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans.\n\"That shot changed the world because of what Michael Jordan became,\" the 85-year-old told BBC Sport. \n\"When he took the shot, it convinced me that he would take any shot in the world.\"\nBut it was Vaccaro who had to take a shot first. \nIn his memoir, Legends and Soles, he describes how he had to convince his bosses to take a chance on an up-and-coming star, while competitors such as Converse were endorsing household names including Earvin 'Magic' Johnson.\nBy that time, Vaccaro had established himself as a basketball insider with an extensive knowledge of young players. In 1964, aged 24, he established The Dapper Dan Roundball Classic - the first national high school all-star basketball game.\nThe tournament ran under different guises until 2007, showcasing future NBA stars including Moses Malone, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Love, Kobe Bryant, Patrick Ewing and Shaquille O'Neal.\nHe also founded the ABCD basketball summer camp in 1984 - an invitational that gathered the country's highest-ranked high school players.\nNevertheless, Vaccaro told BBC Sport former Nike boss Phil Knight was not satisfied with the Jordan proposal \"until the last minute\".\nTheir gamble turned the company's fortunes around, transformed the way basketball was viewed globally and left an indelible print on sneaker culture worldwide. The story was popularised in 2023 film Air, in which Vaccaro is played by Matt Damon.\nIn his book, as well as detailing the Jordan deal, he describes how he was able to spot the potential in future stars including Bryant, Tracy McGrady and James, whom he narrowly missed out on signing to an endorsement in 2003.\nNike's offer to Jordan in 1984 included a guaranteed $250,000 a year for five years, plus a stake in his own line of merchandise. It would make the 21-year-old, who was the third pick in the NBA draft that year, one of the richest athletes in the world.\nAfter signing that deal, Jordan went on to become arguably the greatest NBA player of all time, winning six championships, six Finals MVPs, five regular-season MVPs and a record 10 scoring titles.\nHis partnership with Nike also catapulted the franchise from a company that mainly dealt in running shoes into a global behemoth worth just under $30bn, external (\u00a323bn), with a monopoly over the NBA.\n\"My personal opinion is that if there is no Michael Jordan, you wouldn't even be talking about a Nike shoe company,\" Vaccaro said. \n\"That's the one deal that changed America's view of basketball players and endorsements. He was magnetic.\n\"Other people had endorsements with companies and they'd hold up a shoe and say: 'Wear this, I wear this.' Michael didn't have to hold up the shoe. He took the shot and then wore the shoe.\"\nThe Air Jordan shoe, designed by Peter Moore, first retailed in 1985. By 1986, $100m, external worth of Air Jordan shoes and products had been sold.\nA pair of championship trainers worn by Jordan sold for $8m (\u00a36.3m) at auction last year.\nThis video can not be played\nHow a young Kobe Bryant grabbed Vaccaro's attention in 1994\nIn 1993, Vaccaro joined Adidas America. For the next decade, he battled with his former employer for the signatures of the nation's hottest up-and-coming NBA stars.\nOne of the coups Vaccaro managed during his time with the German sportswear company was to sign 18-year-old Bryant to a $5m, five-year deal in 1996, a month before he entered the NBA straight from high school.\nThe marketer first encountered the future five-time NBA champion when he was invited to play at one of Vaccaro's ABCD camps in 1994.\n\"It took Kobe all of a week to blast to the top of my 'gifted' list,\" he writes. \"Competing against the top 160 American players, along with a handful of prospects from places like China, France, Australia, Canada and Russia, Kobe was intimidated by no-one.\"\nWhat left a lasting impression on Vaccaro was the fact Bryant approached him at the end of the week to apologise for not having won the MVP award, despite only being 16.\n\"I knew that this kid had that hidden thing - drive, an ambition and a belief in himself,\" he told BBC Sport. \"He was the most confident, outward person I've ever been around in my life.\"\nBryant returned to Vaccaro's summer camp the following year and won the MVP award.\nIn 1997, Vaccaro signed McGrady, just as he was about to enter the NBA draft from high school as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors.\nMcGrady, who would go on to become a seven-time NBA All-Star, had made an impression on the sports marketer at the 1996 ABCD camp. However, he almost was not included after his school coach kicked him off the team and advised Vaccaro not to deal with the youngster.\n\"We invited Tracy because of all the backlash,\" Vaccaro said. \"Those five days at camp changed the whole world. He was voted the number one player in camp. No-one knew his name!\"\nThe story of Vaccaro's life seems to hinge on a number of these serendipitous moments.\n\"What if those people in Pittsburgh were to say no to me and the Dapper Dan in 1964?\" he said. \"One no and this life is over. You'd be looking for someone else to interview.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHighlights: Scotland 0-3 Greece\nWith 17 minutes left to play at Hampden, Greece manager Ivan Jovanovic added insult to Scottish injury when calling ashore two of his best players, the duo who had done more than anybody else to put his team into an unassailable lead.\nThe game was long done by then; 3-0 going on more. Scotland had been as wretched as Greece had been classy. Part of Hampden was exasperated, part of it was angry, another part was on its way home, fed up.\nGiannis Konstantelias had scored Greece's first and assisted the second.  No need to exert him any more, not when there was not a scintilla of a threat of a comeback from Scotland.\nKonstantinos Karetsas, the teenage sensation, had scored that brilliant second goal. He came off, too. Job done. Another mortifying reflection of Greece's dominance.\nWas 'embarrassing night' just a 'bump in road' for Scotland?\nScotland relegated from Nations League A after dismal loss to Greece\nScotland didn't have a whole load of composure from the start, but at a painfully early stage they lost the bit they had. Lewis Ferguson clothes-lined an opponent and got a yellow card. George Hirst went yapping to the referee and he got booked as well.\nAs the savage reality of their own inadequacies was hitting them right between the eyes, Kieran Tierney had possession 20 yards into the Greek half. In front of him, a barren landscape. No movement, no options. He turned and booted it back to Craig Gordon and Hampden let him have it.\nBoos rang around the national stadium and it was fair enough. A few moments later, Grant Hanley played an agricultural hoof down the park, the ball careering out of play with no Scotsman in sight. Cue another visceral response from the home fans.\nShortly after that Gordon knocked a clearance straight to Greek substitute Giorgos Masouras. Slapstick stuff. \"Embarrassing\" as John McGinn described the performance, later on. And it was. Embarrassing and unsettling.\nRyan Christie expressed his frustration, \"especially with how well the first leg went\". We could revisit that now. The bottom line of Athens last Thursday was, indeed, amazing, but there were warning signs.\nScotland won the game through a penalty they should never have got and a defensive display that was always going to be hard to repeat.\nJovanovic learned a lot about how to attack this Scotland team. They tore them apart with their speed of thought and speed of movement, the accuracy in their passing and the ruthlessness in their finishing.\nWe could go on and on in highlighting Scotland's failings. We could document their shocking lack of accuracy and their dismal habit of affording Greece all the time and space they needed to build their lead, but it would take too long.\nWhat you were left with at the end was a feeling of despondency at how poor Scotland actually were. If there was hope, and belief, that this type of performance was maybe behind them, then this was the rudest of rude awakenings.\nIt was a return to the worst of times under Steve Clarke - the World Cup exit to Ukraine, the horrible loss in Dublin that followed it, the soul-destroyer against Hungary in Germany. It was only one bad day amid a recent upturn, yes, but it felt worse than that.\nSeeing practically all of Scotland's go-to men fail was quite something. Just when you had trust in them again after three excellent victories in a row, they go and do this.\nThis video can not be played\nClarke will 'look at what I could have done better'\nClarke has shown a fantastic capacity to recover from setbacks and there's reason to believe in his ability to do the same again now, but there was a weariness at Hampden. \"It was a kick up the backside,\" said McGinn. But why was it needed?\nThere were more boos at full-time but a fair number of supporters had vanished by then. It would be too dramatic to say their optimism of making the World Cup also disappeared, but the fact is Greece are in Scotland's group and they have now done a proper psychological number on Scotland before those games in the autumn. Clarke said as much in the aftermath.\nHe has some months to ponder things now, a window in which to consider his next move. He suggested he regretted not changing his team a little more from Thursday to Sunday. He spoke about freshness, or lack of it. \"I'll go away and look at myself,\" he said.\nWhat might he be thinking about? The safe return of Ben Doak to add width and pace, for sure. The desperately needed reintroduction of Aaron Hickey after his awful injury woes, without question.\nClarke is deeply loyal to the players who have delivered for him, but Scott McKenna is playing in La Liga every week.  The composition of his midfield, too. Kenny McLean has been a tremendous servant but the time has surely come for Ferguson to take over.\nRelegation to League B is, in itself, no great disaster. Scotland will win more games down there. They'll have a better chance of grabbing a play-off place in the next Euros while operating in less rarefied air.\nThe thing that made Sunday stunning was the complete disintegration of a team we thought had more about them. That was the takeaway. Clarke has been here before, but the hope was he would never be back here again.",

It would be too dramatic to say their optimism of making the World Cup also disappeared, but the fact is Greece are in Scotland's group and they have now done a proper psychological number on Scotland before those games in the autumn.

We could document their shocking lack of accuracy and their dismal habit of affording Greece all the time and space they needed to build their lead, but it would take too long.What you were left with at the end was a feeling of despondency at how poor Scotland actually were. They tore them apart with their speed of thought and speed of movement, the accuracy in their passing and the ruthlessness in their finishing.We could go on and on in highlighting Scotland's failings.",

As an artist, she wants to help everyone else understand too.\nSara stops walking and points excitedly over the drystone wall into the field beyond.\nThere, strutting among the scattered sheep, is a lapwing, the literal icon of the North Pennines having been immortalised in the area's logo. \n\"They are brilliant,\" Sara says, a smile across her face as she watches the small bird peck between long blades of grass.\nThe 58-year-old lifts one hand up behind her head and waggles her gloved fingers over the top of her homemade woolly hat.\n\"They have these feathers protruding from their head, they always remind me of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti and her crown.\"\nIt is a few days into spring and the lapwings have returned to Teesdale, the Durham dale Sara, her husband and two children have called home for more than 20 years.\nAlthough the sun is out, it is a bitingly cold day in the fields above Low Force, one of the waterfalls that bejewels the River Tees.\nFurther down the track, Sara finds a speckled brown feather, pocketing it for closer inspection back at the wooden desk in her 275-year-old stone-floored cottage.\nSara is out for one of her regular walks for inspiration, making sketches and mental notes to help her with her work.\nHer speciality is wire birds, intricate life-size sculptures weaved from spools of metal strands that attempt to capture the vitality of the creatures Sara loves so much.\nShe has made kingfishers and ravens, wrens and curlews, with some of her sculptures installed on a nature trail around Durham Wildlife Trust's reserve at Low Barns near Bishop Auckland.\n\"It's about drawing attention to certain birds,\" she says, adding: \"A lot of the birds I've made have been endangered or are on the red list. They're really cool little things.\n\"I'm very conscious the birds that come up here are diminishing in number. The environmental impact of what we do on birds is pretty horrendous, so anything I can do that makes people feel emotion or interest when they look at a sculpture is good for the environment.\"\nSara is as adept at explaining the anatomy of the birds and geology of the local rocks as she is at just marvelling at the beauty of the area and its wildlife.\nShe has science degrees from Aberystwyth, Sheffield and Durham, including one in zoology for which she studied sparrows for her dissertation. She is also a qualified teacher.\nBut she also has a lifelong love of art and passion for creating things, engendered by her grandparents and reinforced by her engineer father and a mother who, among other things, is an accomplished potter.\n\"They were all good with their hands,\" Sara says. \"I grew up seeing my parents make stuff, seeing people create.\n\"Everybody can make, everybody is creative.\"\nBack at her cottage in Mickleton, Sara fiddles with a strip of wire as she talks, twisting and reforming it as she eulogises over its malleability.\n\"If it's not the right shape, you can bend it back again,\" she says. \"It's about using your imagination and problem solving.\"\nIt is why science and art make perfect bedfellows, she says.\nAt school in Sutton Coldfield, Sara was encouraged to follow scientific pursuits rather than artistic ones, a distinct separation made between the two disciplines.\n\"I think that's a mistake,\" she says, adding her later forays into artistic pursuits such as  felt-making and now wire modelling are some of the ongoing \"tiny rebellions\" against her earlier enforced segregation.\nScientists and artists both notice things, but while scientists measure, artists interpret, Sara says.\nShe relies on science to produce her art, be it physics to make structures, anatomy to understand the birds or just general \"problem solving\".\n\"I'm bringing science into my sculptures all the time. It's quite a privilege to be able to take something, study it and then try and make it out nothing.\n\"You could build a raven from a million different materials so artists are playing to see what they can use, which is what material scientists do too.\n\"So scientists need artist and artists need science and the two shouldn't be separated.\"\nThere are no blueprints, each of her sculptures is based on meticulous research and a lot of trial and error.\nShe starts with the feet and works her way up, taking about six weeks to complete a model.\nSara has made two ravens, which she has named Huginn and Muninn after the Norse god Odin's own corvid companions.\nHuginn recently spent a few weeks in London as part of the Royal Society of British Artists annual exhibition.\n\"It was an absolute treat to go down and they displayed him beautifully,\" Sara says.\n\"He was just checking everybody out and looking at all the people going past. I think he will have some stories to tell.\n\"People said to me can you bear to let him go and I was thinking 'yeah, absolutely', because that's the point of making these things.\n\"I want people to think about birds so it's no good if they're sitting here with me. \n\"I want other people to be thinking about all these amazing birds that we've got in this country, so I've just got to keep on making.

It comes before football.\"\nAs Ramadan draws to a close, Bournemouth's Dango Ouattara is clear where his priorities lie.\nThe forward from Burkina Faso is a devout Muslim who prays five times a day, as well as before and after each game he plays, saying it helps him to \"stay humble\".\n\"It allows us to refocus on ourselves, to see what we've done well and what we haven't been able to do well,\" the 23-year-old tells BBC Sport Africa when we meet at his local mosque in Poole.\n\"It also allows us to correct ourselves in society too. It allows us to stay on the right path.\"\nDuring our conversation, Ouattara regularly uses words such as \"calm\" and \"stable\" to describe the benefits of Islam.\nA quiet and thoughtful character, verging on shy, there is nothing bling about him. He arrives early for our interview, dressed head-to-toe in white, asking to pray before we settle down to chat.\n\"Faith allows me to overcome many challenges, to respect others, to respect choices and religions too,\" he explains.\n\"Whether it's on the pitch, off it with friends or even with my family, it allows me to be calm in my daily life.\n\"You have to believe before you can do something.\"\n'Fans are living through Bournemouth's best period - enjoy the ride'\nBournemouth's Semenyo motivated by trial rejections\nThis season, Ouattara seems full of belief in his own abilities.\nDespite not being a consistent starter, he has nine goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for the Cherries, including a hat-trick against Nottingham Forest in January.\nThose numbers are a vast improvement on last season, when he only scored once.\nWith Andoni Iraola's side potentially challenging for European football, Ouattara says the team is \"great fun\" to play in.\n\"The secret this year is that we've had the same squad, virtually the same players and the same coach. It's important to have a group that continues to develop together,\" he added.\n\"You can see every time that the players enjoy it.\n\"We're going to do everything we can to go further.\"\nBorn in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital, Ouattara himself has been on a journey, having arrived on England's south coast via French side Lorient.\nSigned for \u00a320m ($26m), when he made his debut in January 2023 he became only the second Burkinabe to appear in the Premier League, following on from his national team captain and former Aston Villa forward Bertrand Traore.\nStill uncomfortable speaking in English for prolonged periods, he confirms language was the main problem when he arrived, but says religion played its part there too.\n\"My agent and I were able to find the mosque, so I started to get back into my routine,\" he explains.\n\"And as I came to the mosque, everything went well for me with the football. So I found myself back in the environment I'd left behind in Lorient.\n\"It helps because when you find yourself in another town, having the community shows that you're not alone. You have the opportunity to pray with other people, to meet new people.\n\"It keeps us focused on religion.\"\nOuattara tries to visit his local mosque in Poole as often as his training schedule allows\nThis year, Ramadan began on Friday 28 February and will finish on Sunday 30 March.\nThe month is considered holy as Muslims believe it marks when the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.\nFor adherents, fasting plays a key role, foregoing food and drink between sunrise and sunset.\n\"I wouldn't say that Ramadan is difficult, it's more mental, because personally I'm used to doing it,\" says Ouattara.\n\"It's more the lack of water. And given that you have to wake up at unusual times to eat, that's more tiring.\"\nBut he has a cunning plan to combat the fatigue: naps.\n\"I wake up at 4.30am, I do my ablutions and I've already got the food which has already been prepared by the club chef.\n\"I eat, and after prayers I have time to go back to bed for an hour or so before training.\n\"Then after the sessions I say my prayers and sleep for another hour. So the fact that I rest each time means I recover better.\"\n'Faith before work' - Doucoure's life as a Muslim player\n'Ramadan is a time to enjoy what you have' Video, 00:03:50'Ramadan is a time to enjoy what you have'\nDespite his fast, and when he is not napping, Ouattara's training plan remains pretty much the same.\n\"It's even easier when you have the support of the whole team, whether it's the players or the staff,\" he said.\n\"Everyone asks me 'How are you feeling? Is it going well? Is it not too difficult?'\n\"They understand me and they encourage me.\"\nAlthough he is the only Muslim in Bournemouth's squad, Ouattara is far from alone as a Premier League player fasting during Ramadan.\nIndeed, the month has become so high profile that in 2021 the league introduced a new agreement that allows officials to call a halt to games in progress at sunset to allow players to break their fast.\nIt is something for which Ouattara is grateful.\n\"The initiative of the Premier League is to be congratulated because it's not easy to play while fasting,\" he added.\n\"We hope that it will continue.\"\nDango Ouattara is someone who hears the call to prayer strongly, something that has helped turn him into a player Bournemouth fans can have faith in.\nBournemouth",

Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.\nThese White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.\nThat an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.\nAnd that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.\n\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.\nDemocratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.\n\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.\nCriticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.\nDon Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"\nWith Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.\n\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"\nTrump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.\nThe White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \nBy Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.\nIn its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.\nJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.\nWhile the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.\nHe noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"\nThe vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".\n\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\nThis is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.\nDick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.\nThis is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.\nLike this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.\nTheir revelation also proved to be politically damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.\n\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.\nOn Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Papua New Guinea, with an estimated 1.3 million users - including many small businesses that rely on it for sales.Social media has also been key in facilitating public discourse amid declining press freedom in the country.Neville Choi, president of Papua New Guinea's media council, said the move \"borders on political autocracy, and an abuse of human rights\". In 2023 Papua New Guinea launched a parliamentary inquiry into \"fake news, bad news reporting and social media [platforms]\" in the country.Asia \"We have a couple of hundred thousand people in the informal sector and they'll be feeling uncertain, so I'm hoping the systems come back online soon to allow them to trade,\" he said.Papua New Guinea authorities have long threatened to make a move against Facebook. Despite the ban, many users have still been able to access Facebook using virtual private networks, or VPNs.",

It was like throwing a snowball and then running your hands under hot water afterwards. It's really painful and hot.\"\n\"And then it spread to my feet.\"\nIn August that year, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) which affects the central nervous system.\n\"It was almost a relief to have the diagnosis because it allowed me to make the necessary adjustments and get on with my life.\"\nBut he was also concerned that his professional career might be over.\n\"The day they told me I had MS, I thought I was done. I wasn't even 40 at that point and I thought I'd have to sell my guitars and find some other way to make a living.\n\"But the neurologist said, 'Give it time'.\"\nWithin two months, he was on a new treatment, and ready to leave hospital.\nOcean Colour Scene had just announced their first tour in almost two years \u2013 and Meade was keen to be part of it.\n\"My hands didn't work. I couldn't tie my laces. I couldn't do a zip up - I was dropping everything. \n\"To have something to aim for was important.\"\nHe called the other band members - Simon Fowler, Steve Cradock and Oscar Harrison - and told them what had happened.\n\"I said I was aware that I might not get back to the level of being able to perform live, but they just said 'Get fit, see you in December'.\"\nThe gig in the band's home city of Birmingham was an emotional one, for them and the audience.\nBut Meade was just focused on getting through the set.\n\"I had a stool hidden behind an amp and I thought if I can get through this without sitting down, I'll be doing ok.\nIn the end I didn't need it. And there was this outpouring of emotion. It was such a terrible time and it was a release to get back to playing live music.\"\n\"We all had a hug when we came off stage.\"\nHaving returned to live touring, Meade had another challenge to face. Making his own music.\n\"I couldn't hold a pen \u2013 which means I can't do my crossword either. My head was just scrambled with too much information. I made the mistake of googling MS and I was just swamped with information. \n\"The thing to remember is that no one - with my brain - has ever had this before so I needed to find out what's right for me.\"\nHe started to train his brain with games like chess, and slowly the songwriting abilities returned.\nThe result is his first new single since his diagnosis, Holy Water, which has been released on Alan McGee's new label Creation Youth.\nFor a boy who grew up in the southside of Glasgow, idolising Oasis, and later ran Liam Gallagher's clothes label Pretty Green, it was a dream moment.\n\"I used to send him demo cassettes. It's a full circle moment. And to be writing again and to have that music released by Alan McGee meant everything.\"\n\"I'd never thought I'd get back to playing with the band and writing my own music, being able to record it and being at a level that Alan McGee finds it worthy of releasing.\"\nThis week he and the rest of Ocean Colour Scene kick off their latest tour in Leeds. The band whose hits include The Riverboat Song and The Day We Caught the Train will play two dates at Glasgow's 02 Academy on 15 and 16 April.\nAnother dream come true for the boy who saw the band as a teenager at the Glasgow Barrowlands.\nAnd he's planning it carefully.\n\"My neurologist said you need to think when you wake up that you have an allocation of energy tokens and be careful how you use them. I'm an expert napper. If I'm doing something in the evening, I lay off in the day to balance the fatigue. It's manageable.\"\n\"I found out that the actress Jamie Linn Sigler from the Sopranos had MS all the way through the show. It didn't stop her. I get fans coming up all the time to say their mum, or their uncle has MS.\n\"I want to be an example that it's not the end if you get it. It's manageable. Lean on the MS nurses. You can carry on with your life. You can still be you.\"",

Haller to guide home in the 15th minute.Mohammed Diomande rattled the crossbar for the hosts after the break but The Gambia carved out several chances on the counter attack as the game wore on.Fofana showed alertness to rush off his line to foil Alieu Fadera and shortly afterwards the Scorpions man skewed wide from 12 yards out.Fofana was called into action again to push away a low effort from Mahmudu Bajo, while Alassana Jatta placed his effort too close to the Elephants keeper with seven minutes remaining.The Gambia then came close to grabbing a point in stoppage time, but Fofana cut out

        "article_text": "Prime Minister and Liberal leader Mark Carney has called an election in Canada, kickstarting five weeks of campaigning before Canadians head to the polls.\nVoting day will officially be on Monday 28 April.\nIt will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the two major parties in Canada - the Conservatives and the Liberals - are neck-and-neck in the polls, making it a race to watch.\nWhile Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.\nHere is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major parties.\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few days.\nHis party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.\nFor many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.\nHe was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. \nCarney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.\nBut Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. His French is also weak, which could be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec. \nRecent polls show his party is slightly trailing behind the Conservatives, but more Canadians say they think Carney would be a better prime minister than his opponent Pierre Poilievre.\nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.\nSince then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.\nHe is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government.\nIt is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.\nBut the Liberal Party has since caught up to him in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader.\nPoilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".\nPoilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first.\"\nTrump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.\nStill, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.\nBlanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, calling Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nHe has also dismissed Trump's tariffs, saying: \"I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.\"\nOn domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs.\nBlanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.\nPolling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.\nIn 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.\nThe NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\nBut in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.\nAt the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\nBut his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls show that only 9% of Canadians intend to vote for them as of mid-March, with their ground shrinking while support for the Liberals has risen.\nA big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. \nIn the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.\nAs Canada gears up for an election this year, the BBC wants to hear from voters across the country.

Born to Greek parents in Genk, Karetsas joined their academy and quickly accelerated through the ranks to make his first-team debut at the end of last season as a 16-year-old substitute against Cercle Brugge. He started for the first time in a win over Royal Antwerp two weeks later.\nThis season, he has been a first-team regular, starting 14 and coming on in another 11 games, mainly as an attacking midfielder and helping Genk to the top of the Jupiler Pro League.\nKaretsas represented Belgium at youth level, playing for their under-21s as recently as November.\nBut, as Greek journalist Stephen Kountourou explained on BBC Scotland's Daily Football Podcast, there was a wrangle going on behind the scenes.\n\"We had to fight tooth and nail with the Belgian FA to stop him representing them and that was seen as a big coup for Greek football, because Karetsas is rated not just as a potentially decent talented player but as one of the big players for the future in international football,\" he said.\nFor Karetsas, whose idols include Neymar and Ronaldinho, there seemed to be little doubt as to whom he would represent at senior level.\n\"My heart beats only for Greece - my homeland fulfils me completely,\" he was quoted as saying.\nHe was warmly welcomed into the fold by the Greek fans on Thursday and his performance was so impressive BBC Scotland's co-commentator James McFadden fully expects him to start at Hampden.\n\"I thought he looked really classy, composed, willing to take people on and, when he came on, he was their main outlet,\" he said. \"They were just desperate to get the ball to him, so I think he comes straight into the team.\"\nPat Nevin, working at the game for BBC Radio Scotland and Five Live, was similarly impressed.\n\"I thought he made a huge difference, probably the main reason the game changed massively in the second half,\" the former Scotland winger added.\n\"Chatting to Steve Clarke afterwards, he agreed the young lad is pretty special and somebody that needs to be kept a really close eye on.\"\nKaretsas himself clearly does not lack confidence.\n\"Already, I feel like I belong in the national team. I'm really happy I made the decision to be here,\" he said afterwards.\n\"I was up against Andy Robertson. He is a very good player, but when I go one on one, I don't see who's in front of me.\n\"We lost, but we played well in the second half and that is how we have to play on Sunday in Scotland. I think, if we play like that, we will win.\"\nTrying to ensure that does not happen will be Craig Gordon, who acknowledged the threat his young adversary posed.\n\"He looked fantastic when he came on,\" said the Hearts goalkeeper. \"He's someone we'll need to look out for in the second leg.\n\"I haven't seen many debuts like that from someone so young. It was an impressive first cap for him, but thankfully we managed to keep him out.\n\"We'll see what Sunday brings and he might get more minutes at Hampden.

Characters such as Viktor Hovland, who dragged himself from apparent golfing oblivion to become the latest winner on the PGA Tour.\nThis out of the blue success was an astonishing turnaround of form and fortune.\n\"It's like you keep drowning and you're running out of air,\" the 27-year-old Norwegian said of his recent travails after beating Justin Thomas in the Valspar Championship last Sunday to land yet another European victory on American soil this year.\nHovland's late surge secures Valspar Championship victory\nEngland's Mansell wins maiden DP Tour title\nEngland's Rhodes holds nerve to claim maiden LET victory\nIt is fair to say Hovland's success was among the least expected in a series of 2025 wins that will surely cheer European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald. This was the Oslo born star's first win since the 2023 Tour Championship.\nThen he was ranked the fourth best player on the world, someone who possessed an unorthodox but highly effective swing and who had solved his problems around the green, seemingly the only aspect holding him back.\nIn short, he looked a complete player, one ready to start winning majors and capable of becoming a dominant figure. The finished article.\nYet, there is no such thing in this game. The pursuit for better never ends and capriciously it brings no guarantees of improvement.\nThere are those who say \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  Rory McIlroy used that very phrase talking about aspects of his own game in the wake of his recent play-off win at the Players Championship.\nBut Hovland most certainly does not fall into that category.\n\"I find it kind of weird that we're professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, 'oh he's a perfectionist, he's out on the perimeter searching too much',\" he commented.\n\"That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments. So if you're not going to try to get better, what are you doing?\"\nThis from a player who had the world at his feet, only to then make a string of swing changes while emulating the Watford FC approach to hiring and firing coaches.\nIn the 574 days that followed his Tour Championship victory, Hovland slumped from first to 137th on the tour's FedEx Cup standings. He had missed the cut in his previous three outings, including starting the Players with a ruinous 80.\nBut the golfer believed the constant tinkering, the pursuit of perfection, to be entirely justified. \"It's not like I'm inventing stuff,\" he said.\nBut what he did realise was that he needed to go back to feels and methods that had previously worked. \"I have data that can show that what I used to do was objectively better than what I'm doing now.\n\"So why shouldn't I try to go back to what I used to do?\"\nHe reconnected with former coach Grant Waite while still pondering whether it was worth heading to Tampa for the tournament he ultimately won. \"I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week,\" Hovland admitted.\nBetween them they found an old feel on the range last Tuesday. It had been lost in pursuit for more speed and its rediscovery was a vital building block.\n\"He's really hard on himself,\" Hovland's caddie Shay Knight told PGATour.com. \"But as soon as he finds some little swing cue or thought, he tends to take it on board, and it happens really fast.\n\"And it just seemed to click; I knew something special was going to happen this week with the swing thought.\"\nHovland was far from perfect and still fearful of losing long shots high and right, but he had a foundation to make him competitive. \"Incredibly, I did make it work and was able to win and I think that is something that I'm extremely proud of,\" he smiled.\nThe game remains \"more stressful than it should be\" but he feels reuniting with Waite, a former tour player, will lead to more success.\n\"He's definitely put his heart and soul into looking at all the different golf swings that I've sent him,\" Hovland said.\n\"It's challenging because I have a very unique pattern and it's unconventional and I would say most coaches probably would like to make my swing more conventional and hopefully try to fix the problem.\n\"But that's not really how my golf swing works. And I really trust Grant, because he he sees it and knows what kind of matchups need to be there for it to work.\"\nHovland's win follows two PGA Tour victories for Northern Ireland's McIlroy already this year as well as big wins for Swede Ludvig Aberg, Austria's Sepp Straka and Belgium's Thomas Detry.\nThese results fuel optimism for a successful Ryder Cup defence for Europe at Bethpage in September. But do not get carried away.\nBack in 2023 Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Sam Burns were posting victories at this time of year, while Brooks Koepka, Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman landed majors. But the US team were soundly beaten in Rome.\nThere are no guarantees in the sport that Rotella, who has advised a string of major winners, insists is not \"a game of perfect\".  So it should not be a surprise that even Hovland's short-term hopes for next month's Masters are tempered.\n\"Some of the shots that I'm hitting, it's going to make it really difficult for me to be in contention at Augusta,\" he admitted.\n\"You're going to hit so many long irons into par-four holes and you've got to drive it pretty far because the fairways are pretty wide.\n\"It's more of a bomber's paradise versus this place (Copperhead in Tampa) where it's more just about being precise off the tee.\n\"So there's still some things that I need to improve, but luckily we've got two weeks and this is certainly nice to have in the back of my mind leading up to Augusta.\"",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

They are nicknamed I Just Got Back (IJGB) and bring with them more than full suitcases.\nTheir Western accents dip in and out of Pidgin, their wallets are boosted by the exchange rate, and their presence fuels the economy.\nBut it also highlights an uncomfortable truth.\nThose who live in Nigeria, earning in the local naira currency, feel shut out of their own cities, especially in the economic hub of Lagos and the capital, Abuja, as prices go up during festive periods.\nResidents say this is particularly the case for \"Detty December\", a term used to refer the celebrations around Christmas and New Year.\nDetty December makes Lagos almost unliveable for locals - traffic is horrible, prices inflate and businesses stop prioritising their regular customers, a radio presenter based in Lagos tells the BBC.\nThe popular media personality asked not to be named for voicing what some might consider controversial opinions.\nBut he is not the only one to hold these views and has some are pondering, with Easter and the diaspora summer holiday season approaching, whether the IJGBs are helping bridge Nigeria's class divide or are making it even wider.\n\"Nigeria is very classist. Ironically, we're a poor country, so it's a bit silly,\" the radio presenter adds.\n\"The wealth gap is massive. It's almost like we're worlds apart.\"\nIt is true that despite oil-rich Nigeria being one of Africa's biggest economies and the continent's most populous country, its more than 230 million citizens face huge challenges and limited opportunities.\nAt the beginning of the year, the charity Oxfam warned the wealth gap in Nigeria was reaching a \"crisis level\".\nStatistics from 2023 are startling. \nAccording to the World Inequality Database more than 10% of the population owned more than 60% of Nigeria's wealth. For those with jobs, 10% of the population took home 42% of the income.\nThe World Bank says the figure of those living below the poverty line is 87 million - \"the world's second-largest poor population after India\". \nMartins Ifeanacho, professor of sociology at the University of Port Harcourt, says this gap and resulting class divide has grown since Nigeria's independence from the UK in 1960.\n\"We've gone through so much economic hardship,\" the academic, who returned to Nigeria after studying in Ireland in the 1990s, tells the BBC.\nHe points the finger at the greed of those who are in position of political power - be it at a federal or state level.\n\"We have a political elite that bases its calculations on how to acquire power, amass wealth for the purpose of capturing more power.\n\"The ordinary people are left out of the equation, and that's why there is a lot of hardship.\"\nBut it is not just about money in the bank account.\nWealth, real or perceived, can dictate access, status and opportunity - and the presence of the diaspora can magnify the class divide.\n\"Nigeria's class system is hard to pinpoint. It's not just about money, it's about perception,\" explains the radio presenter.\nHe gives the example of going out for a meal in Lagos and how peacocking is so important.\nAt restaurants, those arriving in a Range Rover are quickly attended to, while those in a Kia may be ignored, says the radio presenter.\nSocial mobility is difficult when the nation's wealth remains within a small elite.\nWith odds stacked against those trying to climb the ladder, for many Nigerians the only realistic path to a better life is to leave.\nThe World Bank blames \"weak job creation and entrepreneurial prospects\" that stifle the absorption of \"the 3.5 million Nigerians entering the labour force every year\".\n\"Many workers choose to emigrate in search of better opportunities,\" it says.\nSince the 1980s, middle-class Nigerians have sought opportunities abroad, but in recent years, the urgency has intensified, especially among Gen Z and millennials.\nThis mass exodus has been dubbed \"japa\", a Yoruba word meaning \"to escape\".\nA 2022 survey found that at least 70% of young Nigerians would relocate if they could.\nBut for many, leaving is not simple. Studying abroad, the most common route, can cost tens of thousands of dollars, not including travel, accommodation and visa expenses.\n\"Japa creates this aspirational culture where people now want to leave the country,\" says Lulu Okwara, a 28-year-old recruitment officer.\nShe went the UK to study finance in 2021 - and is one of the IJGBs, having returned to Nigeria at least three times since moving.\nMs Okwara notes that in Nigeria there is a pressure to succeed. A culture where achievement is expected.\n\"It's success or nothing,\" she tells the BBC. \"There is no room for failure.\"\nThis deeply embedded sentiment makes people feel they must do anything to succeed.\nEspecially for those who come from more working-class backgrounds. The IJGBs have a point to prove.\n\"When people go out there, their dream is always to come back as heroes, mostly during Christmas or other festivities,\" says Prof Ifeanacho.\n\"You come back home and you mix with your people that you've missed for a long time.\n\"The type of welcome they will give to you, the children that will be running to you, is something that you love and cherish.\"\nSuccess is chased at any cost and putting on a foreign accent can help you climb Nigeria's social ladder - even if you have not been abroad.\n\"People fake accents to get access. The more you sound British, the higher your social status,\" says Prof Ifeanacho.\nHe recalls a story about a pastor who preached every Sunday on the radio.\n\"When they told me that this man had not left Nigeria, I said, 'No, that's not possible.' Because when you hear him speak, everything is American,\" he says in disbelief.\nAmerican and British accents, especially, act as a different kind of currency, smoothing paths in both professional and social settings.\nPushback on social media suggests some IJGBs are all front - they may lap up the returning hero adulation but in fact lack financial clout.\nBizzle Osikoya, the owner at The Plug Entertainment, a business that hosts live music events in West Africa, says he has encountered some issues that reflect this.\nHe tells the BBC about how several IJGBs have attended his events - but who have gone on to try and get their money back.\n\"They went back to the US and Canada and put a dispute on their payments,\" he says.\nThis may reflect the desperate effort to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of success in a society where every display of wealth is scrutinised.\nIn Nigeria, it seems, performance is key - and the IJGBs who are able to show off will certainly be able to climb the class ladder.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "The education secretary has asked counter-fraud experts to lead an investigation  into reports millions of pounds in student loans are being claimed by people with no intent to study. \nIt follows a report in the Sunday Times which says it found evidence of some individuals enrolling on degree courses at small colleges just to access loans, with no intention of paying them back.  \nBridget Phillipson has called in the Public Sector Fraud Authority (PSFA) to coordinate the government's response to the allegations and to support investigations already under way. \nWriting in the Sunday Times, she said it pointed to \"one of the biggest financial scandals in the history of our universities sector\". \nThe newspaper said most of the students under scrutiny are believed to be at franchised universities - small colleges paid to provide courses for established universities. \nIt claimed there is a concern about the potential \"organised recruitment\" of Romanian nationals in particular to enrol on courses.\nStudent Loans Company (SLC) also identified suspicious applications involving fake documents and address duplication, along with franchised colleges enrolling students who can not speak adequate English, the paper said. \nPhillipson said SLC had been working with law-enforcement agencies to investigate the prevalence of some Romanian students at certain colleges, but not enough was being done to stop wider abuse. \n\"But today's revelations demand that we must go further and faster to protect the public purse. \n\"I will not tolerate a penny of taxpayers' money being misused,\" she wrote. \nShe added franchising in some universities had been \"less about expanding access and more about meeting expanding overheads\", and the Office for Students (OfS) - the independent regulator of higher education in England - should have provided \"guardrails\" in this area. \nMs Phillipson said she plans to bring forward legislation to ensure the OfS has new powers to protect public money.\nThe UK's student loan debt currently stands at \u00a3236.2bn. \nStudents, including overseas students with settled status, can take out government-subsidised loans to help towards their maintenance costs and to cover the cost of tuition fees. \nThe tuition fees are paid directly to a university or education provider, while the maintenance loan is paid directly to a student's bank account in instalments. \nStudents need to repay their loan but not until they earn a certain amount after graduation - with the amounts currently ranging from \u00a324,990 to \u00a331,395 depending on which part of the UK they are based.\nIn England, the loans are eventually written off after 40 years.\nThe Public Sector Fraud Authority is part of the Cabinet Office and Treasury and works with the government and public bodies on reducing fraud.\nThe Department for Education said in a statement it had already taken action to crack down on rogue franchise operators to tackle fraud and it would \"overhaul regulation\" so the OfS better protected taxpayer money. \nA spokesperson said: \"Where misuse or fraud is found we have powers to claw back payments \u2013 and we won't hesitate to use them. \n\"We will bring in tough new laws to ensure the OfS can quickly stop bad actors gaming the system once and for all.\"\nOfS chief executive Susan Lapworth said the \"sharp practices\" alleged in the Sunday Times investigation were \"entirely unacceptable\" and \"represent shocking misuse of public funding\". \nShe added OfS would work with the education department and SLC to address the issues.\nUniversities UK - which represents 141 universities - said it supported the government's proposal to require franchise partners to register with OfS. \n\"If there is evidence of criminal behaviour, we completely agree that it must be rooted out,\" said a spokesman, adding that universities had taken \"extensive actions to tighten controls\" over the last two years.\nHe added: \"We should also remember the legitimate and important role of some franchise provision in meeting the needs of students for whom the traditional model of higher education may be difficult to fit around work commitments, or where study closer to home is essential.\"",

There was no communication from them until 11:00 and even this it was only that they could take us back on Monday, which would involve an eight hour stay at Heathrow.\n \"If you didn't want the flight you had to phone a number that took forever to get through, but I suspect it was a minor inconvenience compared to some.\"\nLess fortunate was Liz Steele, who missed her youngest son Paddy's graduation in Stirling on Friday.\nShe told BBC News: \"It was devastating. \n\"I know that there are people that have been affected much worse than this, but I've been to every other graduation that my kids have had, Masters and undergrads, and I just always thought that I would be there.\"\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye denied the incident - caused by a transformer catching fire within the North Hyde electrical substation - had made the airport a \"laughing stock\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"We have other substations but to switch them in takes time.\n\"The situation was not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences.\" \nA spokesperson for British Airways said around 85% of its services would be able to fly today.\nOn social media Heathrow Airport advised all passengers to check flights in advance before travelling.",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Knight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in chargeFfion WynneBBC Sport journalistPublished8 hours ago372 CommentsConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. Nat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. Clare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. Knight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional.",

        "article_text": "The main rival to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been formally arrested and charged with corruption.\nEkrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, is expected to be selected as the opposition Republican People's Party's (CHP) 2028 presidential nominee in a ballot on Sunday. \nHe has denied the allegations and said they are politically motivated. \"I will never bow,\" he wrote on X before he was remanded in custody.\nHis detention sparked some of Turkey's largest protests in more than a decade. Erdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the CHP of trying to \"disturb the peace and polarise our people\".\nImamoglu was one of more than 100 people, including other politicians, journalists and businessmen, detained as part of an investigation on Wednesday, triggering four consecutive nights of demonstrations.\nOn Sunday, he was formally arrested and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\".\nHe was remanded in custody pending trial. AFP and local media reported he had been taken to a prison in Silivri.\nIn social media posts, Imamoglu criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\", and said judicial procedure was not being followed.\nHe urged people across the country to join protests and to take part in Sunday's vote. Imamoglu is the only person running in the CHP's presidential candidate selection.\nLarge crowds had already gathered near Istanbul's city hall by early evening, and could be seen waving Turkish flags and chanting in front of a row of riot police.\nAs night began to fall, officers were seen firing water cannons at some protesters.\nThe arrest does not prevent Imamoglu's candidacy and election as president, but if he is convicted of any of the charges against him, he will not be able to run. \nThe jailed politician is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president.\nHowever, due to term limits, Erdogan cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution.\nOpposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the Ministry of Justice has criticised those connecting Erdogan to the arrests, and insist on its judicial independence.\nImamoglu has meanwhile been suspended from his post as Instanbul's mayor, Turkey's interior ministry said in a statement.\nProsecutors also want to charge Imamoglu with \"aiding an armed terrorist organisation\", but the Turkish court said it was not currently necessary.\nThe CHP had a de facto alliance with the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) in connection with last year's local elections. \nDEM has been accused of being affiliated with the PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - which it denies. \nThe PKK declared a ceasefire early this month, after waging an insurgency against Turkey for more than 40 years. It is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.\nMeanwhile, Istanbul University announced on Tuesday it was revoking Imamoglu's degree due to alleged irregularities.\nIf upheld, this would put his ability to run as president into doubt, since the Turkish constitution says presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\nImamoglu's lawyers said they would appeal the decision to revoke his degree to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\nThe Supreme Election Council will decide whether Imamoglu is qualified to be a candidate.\nThousands have taken to the streets across Turkey in largely peaceful demonstrations since Imamoglu's detention on Wednesday.\nAn initial four-day ban on gatherings in Istanbul, designed to stifle protests, now covers the whole country. It was extended for another four days on Saturday.\nMore than 700 arrests have been made since the protests began, according to Turkish authorities.\nRiot police have repeatedly clashed with protesters and have been seen firing pepper gas and water cannons towards them.\nOn Saturday, tear gas hung in the air outside the mayor's office in Istanbul before the protests had even started. \nAs the crowds grew throughout the evening, it became hard to breathe as round after round was fired to disperse demonstrators.\nChanting \"rights, law, justice\", people of all ages defied the government ban to protest against what they saw as an unlawful detention.\nOne young woman, dressed in black and wearing a face mask, told the BBC she was not protesting for political reasons or because she supported the opposition, but instead to defend democracy.\n\"I'm here for justice, I'm here for liberty. We're free people and Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\"\nAnother woman, who had brought her 11-year-old son to the protests, said she wanted to include him because she is worried about his future.\n\"It's getting harder to live in Turkey day by day, we can't control our lives, we can't choose who we want and there is no real justice here,\" she said.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney, former two-time central banker, was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister earlier this month, after being elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. \nOn Sunday, he called a snap election. \nSeveral political leaders had called for a vote after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was resigning as leader of the Liberals in January.\nBut after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on the country, sparking a trade war, calls have grown for Canada to go to the polls as soon as possible.\nWith the snap election call, Carney is sending Canadians the polls in a matter of weeks. \nThe election will be held on Monday 28 April. \nBy law, the maximum time between federal elections in Canada is five years. The next vote was officially scheduled for 20 October 2025. \nHowever, there are a couple of scenarios in which an early election can be triggered: \nThe first scenario is what Carney did on Sunday. \nIn the Canadian federal election - as in the UK's general election - voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister. \nInstead, the leader of the party with the majority of members of parliament (MPs) becomes PM. \nThat means Carney will be in the running, along with Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, and Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party. \nFour main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois. \nThe Liberal Party has been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. At dissolution, it held 153 seats. \nThe Conservatives were the official opposition with 120 seats. \nThe Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, had 33 seats, and the NDP had 24. \nThe Green Party held two seats.\nDuring the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead. \nBut the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down. \nFollowing Trump's decision to introduce steep tariffs against Canada, they tightened further, suggesting a neck-and-neck race. \nWhen Trudeau resigned at the beginning of 2025, he did so under significant pressure from his own party. It was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the Liberals' hopes of winning the next election.\nNational polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), suggest how support for the Liberals weakened throughout 2023 and 2024.\nAt the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January 2025 - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%.\nSince then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that 37.5% of Canadians back the Liberals, while 37.1% support the Conservatives. \nThis marks the first time in three years the Liberals are leading in the polls, according to the CBC. \nHow to respond to President Trump's economic threats has overtaken the cost of living as the dominant issue for voters.\nThere are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons. \nAll the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election.\nMembers of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election.\nLike the UK, Canada has a \"first-past-the-post\" electoral system. \nThe candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area.\nThe leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs normally forms the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition. \nIf no party ends up with an overall majority of seats, the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government. \nPractically, it means the party with the most seats will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties.\nTo vote in a Canadian election you must:",

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri converted pole position to win the Chinese Grand Prix, as McLaren made it two wins from two races at the start of the season.\nLando Norris finished second to make it a McLaren one-two, with George Russell's Mercedes completing the top three.\nFerrari's Lewis Hamilton won the sprint race on Saturday but he and team-mate Charles Leclerc were both disqualified from the main grand prix.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Shanghai.\nHow long do you think Red Bull will give Liam Lawson to get up to speed before contemplating a switch? - Jon\nIt rather looks as if their patience has already run out. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.\nIf they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.\nTo understand why, let's rewind.\nIn May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.\nThis was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.\nHorner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. But he remembered the tension between the Sainz and Verstappen camps when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso in 2015 and decided he did not want go there again.\nRe-signing Perez, Horner's theory went, would give him the confidence to recover his form.\nThe strategy failed spectacularly. Perez's performances fell off a cliff, and the team slumped to third in the constructors' championship despite Verstappen winning a fourth world title by 63 points.\nVerstappen only won twice in the final 14 races of the year because the car lost competitiveness and became difficult to drive. Hence Perez's struggles.\nBut Horner and Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko decided that Perez had had his day and they needed to make a change.\nThey paid him off - to the tune of many millions of dollars - and signed Lawson.\nThey picked the New Zealander over his much more experienced team-mate at the junior Racing Bulls team, Yuki Tsunoda, because they believed he had a mental toughness the Japanese lacked.\nLawson has had a dire start to the season. He qualified 18th at the season-opener in Melbourne, where he crashed out of the race, and last in both the sprint and grand prix in China, failing to make much progress in either event.\nBut Verstappen is also struggling - at least relatively. He is not hiding his belief that the car is the slowest of the top four teams - indeed he implied pretty strongly in China that he believed it may not be as fast as the Racing Bull.\nThe Red Bull is nervous on corner entry, has mid-corner understeer and is snappy on exits. And the team don't seem to know how to fix it.\nVerstappen likes a sharp front end, but he doesn't want the car to behave like this. But he can cope, and get a lap time out of it. Lawson cannot, at least not yet.\nLawson was talking in China as if he already knew the writing was on the wall.\n\"It's just (got) a very small window,\" he said. \"It's hard, you know \u2013 it's hard to drive, to get it in that window. I'd like to say that with time that'll come \u2013 I just don't have time to do that. It's something I need to get on top of.\"\nIf Red Bull drop him after two races, the management will have some serious explaining to do.\nIf signing him was the right decision in December, why is it the wrong decision now, they will be asked. If Tsunoda is the driver replacing him, the question becomes even starker.\nAnd if instead they choose Frenchman Isack Hadjar, who has impressed as Tsunoda's rookie team-mate in the first two grands prix, well, that's surely too early.\nEqually, if the first-order problem is the car - as it seems to be - why blame the driver?\nFor many in F1 there is an aphorism that sums up Red Bull's approach to their second seat: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\nLiam Lawson finished 12th in the Chinese Grand Prix, eight positions and nearly 55 seconds behind Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen\nAre Ferrari at fault for the double disqualification, or was it just unlucky and out of their control? \u2013 Ozan\nFormula 1 lives on the edge. To win, teams have to push their cars as close to the limit of the technical regulations as possible - because that is what everyone is doing.\nThe line between success and failure is so fine. And weight and ride height are two of the key performance differentiators.\nOne kilogram of extra weight in F1 costs approximately 0.035secs a lap. Multiply that by the 56 laps of the Chinese Grand Prix, for example, and it's two seconds of race time. Not a lot, but it could be the difference between winning and not, or one place higher or lower.\nThat's just to explain why cars are run to the edge. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.\nIn the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.\nFerrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.\nOf course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight. But exactly the same thing happened to Mercedes with George Russell in Belgium last year when he was disqualified from victory.\nAs for Lewis Hamilton, his skid blocks had worn too much. Again, it's the sort of thing that can happen - indeed, it happened to Hamilton when he was at Mercedes in the 2023 US Grand Prix, and Leclerc in the same race.\nAgain, it's about pushing the margins. Generally with these current cars, the lower they can be run, the more downforce they can create, as long as teams can keep the aerodynamics stable.\nBut run them too low, and they risk wearing the floor excessively - and that's what happened.\nThese things are generally not deliberate. They are just what can happen when pushing performance to the edge.\nAside from the McLaren, who has impressed you the most at this very early stage? \u2013 SJM\nRacing Bulls have had a very strong start to the season. Tsunoda qualified fifth in Australia, and his team-mate Hadjar was seventh on the grid and Tsunoda ninth in China.\nThe races have gone a bit wrong so far, but the car looks strong - in China, Verstappen was even implying it was better than the Red Bull.\nRacing Bulls use a fair few Red Bull parts but since Red Bull have started struggling that is not necessarily the boost it was in theory a year or two ago, when the close relationship between the two teams was causing concern among rivals.\nIn the cockpit, Hadjar, notwithstanding his crash on the formation lap in Australia, has made a strong first impression.\nOverall, a very positive start to the year by the second Red Bull team.\nRacing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda both finished the Chinese Grand Prix but outside of the points\nHow was there such a big gap between Lewis Hamilton's sprint pace and qualifying pace? Or how did the other drivers close the gap in such a short space of time? \u2013 Ash\nThere is a combination of reasons. Ferrari hit the ground running in China and landed on a decent set-up for sprint qualifying in the single practice session before it.\nOn top of that, Hamilton put in a brilliant performance on a track where he has always excelled to take pole.\nBut there was an element of underachievement from other teams involved.\nThe McLaren was the fastest car in China and Oscar Piastri was more comfortable in it than Lando Norris. Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.\nHamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.\nHe drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.\nThe teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.\nAs Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race.\"\nAmong those changes seems to have been lifting the car slightly, which Hamilton more or less confirmed after the race: \"I don't know who said we lifted the car, but we made some other changes, mostly, as well as that, but not massively, just small amounts.\"\nThey did not work - team-mate Leclerc was faster than Hamilton in the grand prix even though he had a damaged front wing. And the changes were not enough to stop Hamilton's car wearing the skid blocks too much. Hence his disqualification.\nThrow in Leclerc's disqualification for his car being underweight and it was a bad day at the office for Ferrari.\nWhy do teams put a board out from the pit wall as the drivers go through; surely all information is passed by the radio or telemetry? \u2013 Phil\nPit boards are there to give non-essential information relating to the drivers - primarily laps remaining. The gap to the drivers in front and behind are often also included.\nThey're also there as a back-up in case the radio fails.\nIt is, to a degree, a hangover from the past. But it's also simple and effective and there is no reason to stop doing it and plenty of reasons to continue.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\n'McLaren the class of the field but have hard tightrope to walk'\nObituary: Eddie Jordan, the flamboyant deal-maker of Formula 1\nChinese Grand Prix Review\nEddie Jordan Tribute",

Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.Hamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.He drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.The teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.As Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.If they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.To understand why, let's rewind.In May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.This was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.Horner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.In the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.Ferrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.Of course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight.",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

The former Ohio senator has said her accomplishments leave him feeling \"humbled\".\nUsha Vance (n\u00e9e Chilukuri) was born and raised in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California, to a mechanical engineer father and a molecular biologist mother who had moved to the US from Andhra Pradesh, India.\nShe graduated with a BA in history from Yale University and was also a Gates Scholar at Cambridge University, where she came away with an MPhil in early modern history.\nIt was as a student at Yale Law School in 2010 that she met Vance, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\nThe experience influenced her future husband's bestselling 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class US Rust Belt. It became a 2020 movie directed by Ron Howard.\nIn his book, Vance writes how he \"fell hard\" for Usha at Yale, describing her as a \"genetic anomaly\" because she possessed so many ideal qualities.\nVance recalls how he \"violated every rule of modern dating\" by telling her he was in love after one date.\nClassmates remember her as someone who stood out in the hyper-competitive world of Ivy League law for her willingness to lend a helping hand.\nCharles Tyler, now a law professor, told the BBC that Usha Vance would take time to advise other students on how to apply for the highly prized judicial clerkships that she herself wanted.\nAnother classmate, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, recalls a similar lack of sharp elbows in Usha Vance.\n\"She was an excellent student, like, top of our law school class,\" she says. \"And sometimes when students are like that, they also, you know, want to maintain an edge over other students.\n\"But she was someone who would always share her outlines [class notes]. They were, like, perfectly organised, you know, colour-coded, the works.\"\nTyler says Usha Vance has a great deal of influence over her husband, although they \"have a very equal partnership\".\nThe other friend concurs.\n\"She's always like a sounding board for him,\" she says. \"And, you know, she's been his spirit guide pretty much since Yale.\"\nUsha Vance's own political views have been the subject of much conjecture.\nWhile her husband has often railed about \"woke\" ideas he says are pushed by Democrats, she was a registered Democrat as recently as a decade ago. Until last summer she was a trial lawyer at San Francisco law firm Munger Tolles & Olson, which boasts its reputation as \"radically progressive\".\nYet she once clerked for Brett Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court justice, on the District of Columbia court of appeals, then clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts - both men are pillars of the highest court's conservative majority.\nOne thing the power couple do seem very much to agree on is the importance of family.\nThe Vances wed in Kentucky in 2014 and have three children: two sons, Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel.\nUsha Vance told Fox News last August that her husband's emphasis on the cultural importance of a loving home stems partly from his own upbringing, but also from \"knowing that the stability and sort of calm that I provide in our family life comes from all the support that I had, the faith that things would be OK, because I had people behind me\".\nIn India, there is immense pride in Usha Vance's storybook life, not least of all from her own relatives.\nHer great-grand-aunt in Andhra Pradesh told the BBC that she is not surprised by the US second lady's success, given that she comes from a long line of Hindu scholars.\nChilukuri Santhamma, a physics professor from Andhra Pradesh, said: \"Not everyone can climb to the top in a foreign country and achieve accolades and it's fortunate that Usha has reached to the position that happens for one in millionth.\"\nAdditional reporting by Soutik Biswas in Delhi",

        "article_text": "There are few US presidential actions more sensitive, more fraught with peril, than when and where to use American military force.\nIf such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives \u2013 and national foreign policy objectives - at risk.\nFortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.\nUnfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.\nThe Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief, in an article posted on Monday on his publication's website, says he appears to have been inadvertently added to the chat by White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz.\nMembers of the group seemed to include Vice-President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others.\nA National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread \"appears to be authentic\".\nGoldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike \u2013 conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team.\n\"Amazing job,\" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March.\nHe followed up with emojis of a US flag, a fist and fire. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.\nThese White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.\nThat an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.\nAnd that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.\n\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.\nDemocratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.\n\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.\nCriticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.\nDon Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"\nWith Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.\n\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"\nTrump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.\nThe White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \nBy Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.\nIn its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.\nJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.\nWhile the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.\nHe noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"\nThe vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".\n\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\nThis is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.\nDick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.\nThis is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.\nLike this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.\nTheir revelation also proved to be politically damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.\n\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.\nOn Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Dr Alan Borthwick, softly spoken in his blazer and tie, looks every bit the typical historian.\nBut this archivist has spent the past 30 years solving a mystery.\nHow did thousands of historical documents that belong in Scotland's national archives end up across the Atlantic Ocean in Canada?\nThe answer is that they were stolen. By one man. With a particular interest in stamps.\nDr Borthwick explains that \"panic\" first set in when a National Records of Scotland (NRS) employee attended an auction in London in 1994.\nThey discovered that 200 of the items up for sale belonged to NRS.\nThese should have been safely in Scotland's archives, not being offloaded to the highest bidder via a bang of the auctioneer's gavel.\nNRS can date back all their archive users to 1847. After some cross referencing, Dr Borthwick and his team realised that the auction items all linked back to one person \u2013 Prof David Stirling Macmillan.\nProf Macmillan was born in 1925 and was from Girvan, Ayrshire. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and studied history at the University of Glasgow.\nHis right to use the national archives had been revoked in 1980 when he was caught removing a document. Staff assumed this was a one-off.\nBut the truth was that Prof Macmillan had been helping himself since 1949.\nThe 200 items that turned up in the London auction were the tip of the iceberg.\nNow National Records of Scotland are revealing the scale of his thefts. And the odd nature of them.\nProf Macmillan wasn't pinching documents that were worth a lot of money, or even those that were particularly historically significant.\nThe archives include letters from Robert Burns and Mary Queen of Scots. But these weren't his targets.\nThe contents of many of the letters he took are mundane, perhaps even boring.\nBut a lifelong interest in stamps and postmarks seem to have led to him taking letters that caught his eye. Including documents dating back to 1637.\nOne example was a letter from a Scot who'd moved to the island of Madeira, off the north west coast of Africa. In 1813 they wrote to a friend with some news and gossip. Not exactly explosive stuff.\nAnd yet Prof Macmillan ripped it out of the book it was stored in and pocketed it.\nWe can't be certain about the motivations involved, but the interesting postmark and wax seal on the document are thought to be what tempted the professor.\nThe thief went to great lengths to cover his tracks.\nHe would remove reference numbers from documents and sometimes replace what he had taken with forgeries.\nIronically, Prof Macmillan was himself a professional archivist. He held that role at the University of Sydney and even placed an appeal for historical papers in the university newspaper.\nThe man who spent years stealing documents stressed they would be \"properly looked after\" and bemoaned the fact the so much of history had been \"destroyed or lost\".\nThe academic moved to Trent University in Canada in 1968 and spent 20 years teaching history, though he still seems to have made annual visits to Scotland's archives. He died in 1987, leaving no immediate family.\nMuch of his collection then found its way into the archives of Trent University, where they remained for some time. They were catalogued and descriptions were put online.\nIn 2012. Dr Alan Borthwick was still trying to track down what had been taken. He realised that thousands of the Trent University items rightly belonged to NRS and other UK institutions.\nDr Borthwick was dispatched to North America to investigate.\nHe says he was amazed by the \"sheer quantity of documents\" he found that had been stolen by Prof Macmillan.\nThe chief executive of NRS, Alison Byrne, echoes this. She described the scale of Prof Macmillan's thefts as \"unprecedented\".\nShe only took up her role six months ago, and was appalled when she was filled in on the situation.\nSecuring the return of these documents was one thing. But finding their rightful home was arguably the bigger task.\nFor decades, Dr Borthwick and his team have been \"piecing together the jigsaw\", undertaking the painstaking process of finding the correct place for all of these stolen items.\nFor context, National Records of Scotland are the custodians of 38 million documents. \nThey have 80 kilometres of shelving \u2013 enough to stretch from Edinburgh to Glasgow.\nTheir archives are all about precision \u2013 every document has an exact home that makes locating it straightforward.\nThe team wanted to get each item that Prof Macmillan had taken brought back to its rightful place.\nFortunately, NRS \"daybooks\" show what he was signing out of the archives. But his attempts to cover his tracks and remove identifying marks complicated the challenge.\nNow National Records of Scotland say they have got almost everything back where it should be, ready to be pored over by a new generation of historians.\nBut, for Dr Borthwick, how does it feel to know that a fellow archivist so egregiously abused the trust that was put in him?\nThe historian labels it \"a kick in the teeth\". He's been trying to undo the damage done by Prof Macmillan for almost all of his working life.\nThat time could have been spent on other historical projects.\nBut Dr Borthwick reflects that there's a \"sense of satisfaction\" in solving the mystery of the missing documents.\nDocuments that, these days, are kept under the watchful eye of CCTV.",

        "article_text": "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".\n\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.\nIts owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are \"the vital underbelly of everything\". \n\"It's where people find themselves,\" he says. \"It's where people find their tribe.\"\nMr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the \"rave generation\", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years. \nAnd according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are \"dropping like flies\".\nIn the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.\nIn London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.\n\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.\nThere are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices. \nBut the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did\nAnd if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?\nFor several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.\nA recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.\nPsychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".\nA YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.\nDr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"\nThere is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.\nWhen lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"\nOf course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".\nThis rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.\nBut Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\" \nThere might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".\n\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"\n\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".\nNot everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".\nEntry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.\nIn an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.\n\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"\nMr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.\nIf clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.\nIn 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.\nRussell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".\nThe company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.\nThe Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.\nBut its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.\nThe Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".\nThere are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success. \nGut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.\nCo-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"\nThen there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.\n\"It's about safety of members,\" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance. \nUltimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs. \n\"For some people it's almost the only place they've got where they can go and feel a sense of belonging and real community,\" he says.\nCat Rossi has spent years researching the creative significance of nightclubs, in her capacity as a design historian and professor of architecture at University for the Creative Arts Canterbury. \"Since the dawn of civilisation we've needed to go out and dance and be together at night,\" she says. \"Social gathering is a core part of our social fabric.\n\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"\nMany fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.\n\nIn 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.\nThe following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.\nIt is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"\nAnd the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg. \n\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"\nBut without that transformation, the UK risks losing more of them.\n\nAdditional reporting by: Laura Lea, Fran Whyte and Harriet Whitehead \nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri converted pole position to win the Chinese Grand Prix, as McLaren made it two wins from two races at the start of the season.\nLando Norris finished second to make it a McLaren one-two, with George Russell's Mercedes completing the top three.\nFerrari's Lewis Hamilton won the sprint race on Saturday but he and team-mate Charles Leclerc were both disqualified from the main grand prix.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Shanghai.\nHow long do you think Red Bull will give Liam Lawson to get up to speed before contemplating a switch? - Jon\nIt rather looks as if their patience has already run out. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.\nIf they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.\nTo understand why, let's rewind.\nIn May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.\nThis was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.\nHorner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. But he remembered the tension between the Sainz and Verstappen camps when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso in 2015 and decided he did not want go there again.\nRe-signing Perez, Horner's theory went, would give him the confidence to recover his form.\nThe strategy failed spectacularly. Perez's performances fell off a cliff, and the team slumped to third in the constructors' championship despite Verstappen winning a fourth world title by 63 points.\nVerstappen only won twice in the final 14 races of the year because the car lost competitiveness and became difficult to drive. Hence Perez's struggles.\nBut Horner and Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko decided that Perez had had his day and they needed to make a change.\nThey paid him off - to the tune of many millions of dollars - and signed Lawson.\nThey picked the New Zealander over his much more experienced team-mate at the junior Racing Bulls team, Yuki Tsunoda, because they believed he had a mental toughness the Japanese lacked.\nLawson has had a dire start to the season. He qualified 18th at the season-opener in Melbourne, where he crashed out of the race, and last in both the sprint and grand prix in China, failing to make much progress in either event.\nBut Verstappen is also struggling - at least relatively. He is not hiding his belief that the car is the slowest of the top four teams - indeed he implied pretty strongly in China that he believed it may not be as fast as the Racing Bull.\nThe Red Bull is nervous on corner entry, has mid-corner understeer and is snappy on exits. And the team don't seem to know how to fix it.\nVerstappen likes a sharp front end, but he doesn't want the car to behave like this. But he can cope, and get a lap time out of it. Lawson cannot, at least not yet.\nLawson was talking in China as if he already knew the writing was on the wall.\n\"It's just (got) a very small window,\" he said. \"It's hard, you know \u2013 it's hard to drive, to get it in that window. I'd like to say that with time that'll come \u2013 I just don't have time to do that. It's something I need to get on top of.\"\nIf Red Bull drop him after two races, the management will have some serious explaining to do.\nIf signing him was the right decision in December, why is it the wrong decision now, they will be asked. If Tsunoda is the driver replacing him, the question becomes even starker.\nAnd if instead they choose Frenchman Isack Hadjar, who has impressed as Tsunoda's rookie team-mate in the first two grands prix, well, that's surely too early.\nEqually, if the first-order problem is the car - as it seems to be - why blame the driver?\nFor many in F1 there is an aphorism that sums up Red Bull's approach to their second seat: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\nLiam Lawson finished 12th in the Chinese Grand Prix, eight positions and nearly 55 seconds behind Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen\nAre Ferrari at fault for the double disqualification, or was it just unlucky and out of their control? \u2013 Ozan\nFormula 1 lives on the edge. To win, teams have to push their cars as close to the limit of the technical regulations as possible - because that is what everyone is doing.\nThe line between success and failure is so fine. And weight and ride height are two of the key performance differentiators.\nOne kilogram of extra weight in F1 costs approximately 0.035secs a lap. Multiply that by the 56 laps of the Chinese Grand Prix, for example, and it's two seconds of race time. Not a lot, but it could be the difference between winning and not, or one place higher or lower.\nThat's just to explain why cars are run to the edge. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.\nIn the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.\nFerrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.\nOf course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight. But exactly the same thing happened to Mercedes with George Russell in Belgium last year when he was disqualified from victory.\nAs for Lewis Hamilton, his skid blocks had worn too much. Again, it's the sort of thing that can happen - indeed, it happened to Hamilton when he was at Mercedes in the 2023 US Grand Prix, and Leclerc in the same race.\nAgain, it's about pushing the margins. Generally with these current cars, the lower they can be run, the more downforce they can create, as long as teams can keep the aerodynamics stable.\nBut run them too low, and they risk wearing the floor excessively - and that's what happened.\nThese things are generally not deliberate. They are just what can happen when pushing performance to the edge.\nAside from the McLaren, who has impressed you the most at this very early stage? \u2013 SJM\nRacing Bulls have had a very strong start to the season. Tsunoda qualified fifth in Australia, and his team-mate Hadjar was seventh on the grid and Tsunoda ninth in China.\nThe races have gone a bit wrong so far, but the car looks strong - in China, Verstappen was even implying it was better than the Red Bull.\nRacing Bulls use a fair few Red Bull parts but since Red Bull have started struggling that is not necessarily the boost it was in theory a year or two ago, when the close relationship between the two teams was causing concern among rivals.\nIn the cockpit, Hadjar, notwithstanding his crash on the formation lap in Australia, has made a strong first impression.\nOverall, a very positive start to the year by the second Red Bull team.\nRacing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda both finished the Chinese Grand Prix but outside of the points\nHow was there such a big gap between Lewis Hamilton's sprint pace and qualifying pace? Or how did the other drivers close the gap in such a short space of time? \u2013 Ash\nThere is a combination of reasons. Ferrari hit the ground running in China and landed on a decent set-up for sprint qualifying in the single practice session before it.\nOn top of that, Hamilton put in a brilliant performance on a track where he has always excelled to take pole.\nBut there was an element of underachievement from other teams involved.\nThe McLaren was the fastest car in China and Oscar Piastri was more comfortable in it than Lando Norris. Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.\nHamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.\nHe drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.\nThe teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.\nAs Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race.\"\nAmong those changes seems to have been lifting the car slightly, which Hamilton more or less confirmed after the race: \"I don't know who said we lifted the car, but we made some other changes, mostly, as well as that, but not massively, just small amounts.\"\nThey did not work - team-mate Leclerc was faster than Hamilton in the grand prix even though he had a damaged front wing. And the changes were not enough to stop Hamilton's car wearing the skid blocks too much. Hence his disqualification.\nThrow in Leclerc's disqualification for his car being underweight and it was a bad day at the office for Ferrari.\nWhy do teams put a board out from the pit wall as the drivers go through; surely all information is passed by the radio or telemetry? \u2013 Phil\nPit boards are there to give non-essential information relating to the drivers - primarily laps remaining. The gap to the drivers in front and behind are often also included.\nThey're also there as a back-up in case the radio fails.\nIt is, to a degree, a hangover from the past. But it's also simple and effective and there is no reason to stop doing it and plenty of reasons to continue.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\n'McLaren the class of the field but have hard tightrope to walk'\nObituary: Eddie Jordan, the flamboyant deal-maker of Formula 1\nChinese Grand Prix Review\nEddie Jordan Tribute",

Tsunoda qualified fifth in Australia, and his team-mate Hadjar was seventh on the grid and Tsunoda ninth in China.The races have gone a bit wrong so far, but the car looks strong - in China, Verstappen was even implying it was better than the Red Bull.Racing Bulls use a fair few Red Bull parts but since Red Bull have started struggling that is not necessarily the boost it was in theory a year or two ago, when the close relationship between the two teams was causing concern among rivals.In the cockpit, Hadjar, notwithstanding his crash on the formation lap in Australia, has made a strong first impression.Overall, a very positive start to the year by the second Red Bull team.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda both finished the Chinese Grand Prix but outside of the pointsHow was there such a big gap between Lewis Hamilton's sprint pace and qualifying pace? Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.Hamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.He drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.The teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.As Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.If they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.To understand why, let's rewind.In May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.This was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.Horner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.In the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.Ferrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.Of course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight.",

        "article_text": "Hovland's victory was his seventh on the PGA Tour\nFamed sport psychologist Bob Rotella constantly reminds his clients that golf is not a pursuit anyone can perfect.\nBut it is a game that still attracts more than its share of perfectionists. Characters such as Viktor Hovland, who dragged himself from apparent golfing oblivion to become the latest winner on the PGA Tour.\nThis out of the blue success was an astonishing turnaround of form and fortune.\n\"It's like you keep drowning and you're running out of air,\" the 27-year-old Norwegian said of his recent travails after beating Justin Thomas in the Valspar Championship last Sunday to land yet another European victory on American soil this year.\nHovland's late surge secures Valspar Championship victory\nEngland's Mansell wins maiden DP Tour title\nEngland's Rhodes holds nerve to claim maiden LET victory\nIt is fair to say Hovland's success was among the least expected in a series of 2025 wins that will surely cheer European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald. This was the Oslo born star's first win since the 2023 Tour Championship.\nThen he was ranked the fourth best player on the world, someone who possessed an unorthodox but highly effective swing and who had solved his problems around the green, seemingly the only aspect holding him back.\nIn short, he looked a complete player, one ready to start winning majors and capable of becoming a dominant figure. The finished article.\nYet, there is no such thing in this game. The pursuit for better never ends and capriciously it brings no guarantees of improvement.\nThere are those who say \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  Rory McIlroy used that very phrase talking about aspects of his own game in the wake of his recent play-off win at the Players Championship.\nBut Hovland most certainly does not fall into that category.\n\"I find it kind of weird that we're professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, 'oh he's a perfectionist, he's out on the perimeter searching too much',\" he commented.\n\"That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments. So if you're not going to try to get better, what are you doing?\"\nThis from a player who had the world at his feet, only to then make a string of swing changes while emulating the Watford FC approach to hiring and firing coaches.\nIn the 574 days that followed his Tour Championship victory, Hovland slumped from first to 137th on the tour's FedEx Cup standings. He had missed the cut in his previous three outings, including starting the Players with a ruinous 80.\nBut the golfer believed the constant tinkering, the pursuit of perfection, to be entirely justified. \"It's not like I'm inventing stuff,\" he said.\nBut what he did realise was that he needed to go back to feels and methods that had previously worked. \"I have data that can show that what I used to do was objectively better than what I'm doing now.\n\"So why shouldn't I try to go back to what I used to do?\"\nHe reconnected with former coach Grant Waite while still pondering whether it was worth heading to Tampa for the tournament he ultimately won. \"I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week,\" Hovland admitted.\nBetween them they found an old feel on the range last Tuesday. It had been lost in pursuit for more speed and its rediscovery was a vital building block.\n\"He's really hard on himself,\" Hovland's caddie Shay Knight told PGATour.com. \"But as soon as he finds some little swing cue or thought, he tends to take it on board, and it happens really fast.\n\"And it just seemed to click; I knew something special was going to happen this week with the swing thought.\"\nHovland was far from perfect and still fearful of losing long shots high and right, but he had a foundation to make him competitive. \"Incredibly, I did make it work and was able to win and I think that is something that I'm extremely proud of,\" he smiled.\nThe game remains \"more stressful than it should be\" but he feels reuniting with Waite, a former tour player, will lead to more success.\n\"He's definitely put his heart and soul into looking at all the different golf swings that I've sent him,\" Hovland said.\n\"It's challenging because I have a very unique pattern and it's unconventional and I would say most coaches probably would like to make my swing more conventional and hopefully try to fix the problem.\n\"But that's not really how my golf swing works. And I really trust Grant, because he he sees it and knows what kind of matchups need to be there for it to work.\"\nHovland's win follows two PGA Tour victories for Northern Ireland's McIlroy already this year as well as big wins for Swede Ludvig Aberg, Austria's Sepp Straka and Belgium's Thomas Detry.\nThese results fuel optimism for a successful Ryder Cup defence for Europe at Bethpage in September. But do not get carried away.\nBack in 2023 Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Sam Burns were posting victories at this time of year, while Brooks Koepka, Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman landed majors. But the US team were soundly beaten in Rome.\nThere are no guarantees in the sport that Rotella, who has advised a string of major winners, insists is not \"a game of perfect\".  So it should not be a surprise that even Hovland's short-term hopes for next month's Masters are tempered.\n\"Some of the shots that I'm hitting, it's going to make it really difficult for me to be in contention at Augusta,\" he admitted.\n\"You're going to hit so many long irons into par-four holes and you've got to drive it pretty far because the fairways are pretty wide.\n\"It's more of a bomber's paradise versus this place (Copperhead in Tampa) where it's more just about being precise off the tee.\n\"So there's still some things that I need to improve, but luckily we've got two weeks and this is certainly nice to have in the back of my mind leading up to Augusta.\"",

She wakes up every morning to pain.\nBefore she was diagnosed she would put her hands in packets of frozen peas in an effort to find some relief.\nShe now takes immunosuppressants, which she says help a bit, but since being injected with the retrained white blood cells she believes she is in less pain.\n\"Is this just me hoping it is? But realistically I do think it is better,\" she says.\n\"If this trial works to switch off rheumatoid arthritis that would be wonderful.\n\"It's a privilege to be part of something that is actually quite a leap forward - if they get it right.\"\nThe outcome of the Newcastle work is being widely monitored as it could have huge implications for the 18 million rheumatoid arthritis patients worldwide.\nProf Isaacs said, if its successful, the research could also have implications for other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis. \n\"It's an area of research that we describe as re-education of the immune system.\nThe first two trials are small - in total about 32 patients have been involved - and more research is needed, but if it shows signs of success another, larger trial will follow.\nEven if all goes to plan and the treatment is shown to re-educate the immune system, it may still be another five to 10 years before patients are able to access it.\nBut Prof Isaacs, who has dedicated his career to the condition, said it would make him and his team immensely proud to have developed the treatment.\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.\nBut there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.\n\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Phillip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.\nIn exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.\nWe're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.\nWater and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.\nPhillip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.\nMore importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.\nSo cheap it made business sense for Phillip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.\nEach machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.\nOccasionally Phillip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.\nAt the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Phillip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.\n\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.\nZengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.\nIt was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.\nBritish-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.\nNow it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.\nAllowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.\n\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.\nThe bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.\nBitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.\nThe town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.\nOnly one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.\nAlthough the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses. \nSo, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.\n\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"\nHe's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.\n\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"\nEmbracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.\nElsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.\nLike many young people, they're glued to their phones.\n\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.\nThe little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.\n\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.\n\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.\n\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"\nNot many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.\nBut soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.\nZengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.\nSoon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.\nPhillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.\nThe company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.\nGridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.\nNorth of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.\nBut Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.\nThe company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.\nThey're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.\n\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.\nThe company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.\nFinding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.\nThe company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.\nBut the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.\nHistory tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.\n\nIn the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.\nAuthorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.\nFor example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.\nAgreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.\nThe environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.\nBut according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.\nSet ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.\nBut they are also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins.",

And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.Gridless' bitcoin mines use excess electricity from renewable energy plantsIt was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.But they are also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins.More Technology of BusinessThe slow but steady advance of driverless vehiclesSubsea fibre cables can 'listen out' for sabotageWhy people are cutting back their online profileBitcoinZambiaAfricaRenewable energyCryptocurrency",

        "article_text": "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?\nThat question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".\nIn October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.\nThe amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.\nThe SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.\nIt says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.\nBut the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.\nThis company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).\nThe key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.\nIt argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.\nAnd so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.\nThe Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.\n\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.\nRum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.\nMr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.\nThe SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.\nBoth the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.\nThe use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.\n\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"\nThis isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.\nThe second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.\nLastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.\nExamples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.\nAnother Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.\nBarbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.\nSimilarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.\nThe failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.\nBack in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.\nMr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.\nAnd while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.\nIn the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".\nIt concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

        "article_text": "\"Horrific to see in black and white. But hardly surprising,\" is how a top European diplomat reacted to what comes across as deep, heartfelt disdain for European allies, revealed late on Monday, European time, in an online group chat between top US security officials.\nSeemingly by accident, Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was also invited to the chat, which discussed planned strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen aimed at unblocking trade routes on the Suez Canal. He subsequently made the frank exchange public.\nIn the chat, Vice-President JD Vance notes that only 3% of US trade runs through the canal, as opposed to 40% of European trade, after which he and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth complain of European \"free-loading\".\nThe monumental security breach is causing a ruckus at home, with Democrats calling for Hegseth's resignation as a result.\nAcross the pond - aka the Atlantic - Europe's leaders and policy-makers felt \"sick to their stomach\", as an EU official put it to me.\nOfficials quoted here are speaking on condition of anonymity in order to comment freely on what are volatile times in US-European relations. You won't see comments in the public domain, so as not to rock the transatlantic boat any further.\nVance first stunned European officials with his speech at last month's Security Conference in Munich condemning the continent for having misplaced values such as protecting abortion clinics and censoring speech in the media and online. \"The enemy from within,\" he called it.\nMonday's Signal chat strikes at the heart of a slew of tensions, discomfort and plain old fear in Europe right now, that the Trump administration can no longer be relied on as the continent's greatest ally. At a time when Europe is facing off against a resurgent Russia.\nWestern Europe has looked to the US to have its back in terms of security and defence since World War Two.\nBut it is precisely that fact that so riles the Trump administration and has cemented Europe in its mind as \"freeloaders\".\nWhile the US commits 3.7% of its colossal GDP to defence, it's taken the majority of European partners in the transatlantic defence alliance Nato until recently to cough up even 2% of GDP. Some, like big economies Spain and Italy, aren't even there yet, though they say they plan to be soon.\nEurope relies heavily on the US, amongst other things, for intelligence, for aerial defence capabilities and for its nuclear umbrella.\nWith the phasing out of conscription in most European countries, the continent also relies on the around 100,000 battle-ready US troops stationed in Europe to help act as a deterrent against potential aggressors.\nEuropeans have focused more on investing in welfare and social services than defence - collective or otherwise - since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Why on earth should the US pick up the slack, asks the Trump administration.\nOn the leaked group chat, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz laments the state of Europe's naval forces. \"It will have to be the United States that reopens these [Suez] shipping lanes.\"\nThe chat then debates how to ensure that Europe remunerates the US for its actions.\n\"If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,\" states a message from someone called SM - presumed to be deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller.\nEurope is now loudly and publicly discussing spending a lot more on its own defence - hoping to keep Donald Trump onside and an aggressive Russia at bay after Ukraine.\nBut Trump's irritation with Europe is nothing new.\nHe displayed his displeasure during his first term in office: furious about Europe's low defence spending; incandescent over the EU's trade surplus with the US.\nThe United States had been long been taken for a ride and that must stop, seemed to be his sentiment.\nImposing trade tariffs was one of Trump's first responses. Then as now.\nEarlier this month, when Trump threatened eye-watering 200% tariffs on European alcohol in an ongoing trade tit-for-tat, he lambasted the EU as \"abusive\" and \"hostile\" for allegedly taking advantage of the US at any opportunity.\nCoinciding uncomfortably with the leaked Signal chat and its Euro-bashing, the EU's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, along with the head of cabinet of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Washington on Tuesday hoping to launch a charm offensive to try to stave off a new tariff onslaught.\nOn defence, Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that the US wouldn't protect countries that \"didn't pay\".\nHis candidate to be the next US ambassador to Nato says that means Europeans spending 5% of GDP.\nThe UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence, aiming for 2.6% by 2027. France scrapes 2.1% of GDP on military spending annually.\nDuring the Cold War, the common enemy was the Soviet Union, which included swathes of Eastern Europe.\nThe US wanted to keep western Europe close, and for it to stay militarily dependent.\nSince then, there has been growing apathy towards Nato and Europe. Particularly after the 9/11 twin tower attacks in the US.\nAttention in Washington turned to Iraq and Afghanistan. To China.\nPresident Obama was clear he wanted Asia to be his top foreign policy priority.\nTrump is far from the first US president to harrumph at Europe's reluctance to do more for, as well as spend more on, its own defence.\nBut with Trump, there is also a deep ideological split.\nOn social values, as JD Vance alluded to in Munich.\nBut also - and this is key - Trump demonstrates not only an antipathy for Europe and an impatience to get the war in Ukraine \"done and over\", he also displays an affinity for Russia's Vladimir Putin, at a time when Europe considers him an immediate threat to the security and well-being of the whole continent.",

As a kicking unit we wanted to go there and flash our talent, let the scouts know that we are there for a reason and on merit,\" said McNamee.  \n\"I wasn't overly focused on the numbers but more the process of kicking and making sure we came across well.\"\nThe pair know that being in the international class, they have to work just that little bit harder than their American peers to catch the scouts' eyes.\n\"You're definitely an underdog,\" said Bolger. \n\"There's a low expectation but then there is a really high ceiling.  When you're going kick-for-kick alongside Americans and then are doing better than them, that's when the scouts here are impressed.\"\nJude McAtamney (right) last November became the first Irish-born placekicker to feature in a regular season NFL game since 1985 while Charlie Smyth (left) remains part of the New Orleans practice squad as he also attempts to forge an NFL career\nUnlike McNamee, who went straight from gaelic football into the IPP programme, Bolger has just completed two years' college experience as a kicker and punter with the Idaho State Bengals after his talent was discovered and honed by the Irish kicking coach and mentor Tadhg Leader.\n\"Once I got a full scholarship, that was the time when I really believed I could do it.  I gauged myself against American lads and that gave me the confidence that what Tadhg was saying was right,\" added the Laois man.\n\"And I have great memories \u2013 two years playing college football in the States was a class experience. I played in front of 35,000 against Oregon State in the opening game of last season in a great atmosphere.\"\nAs Pro Day approaches, McNamee says they have taken much inspiration from Smyth and McAtamney's path to the big time this time last year.\n\"It was amazing to see someone could go from playing gaelic football to competing at the NFL Combine. Once I saw that I knew I had a skill that would transfer well if I was given time to prepare,\" the Ballyboden GAA goalkeeper added.\n\"Charlie was the trailblazer for me. He's incredible and confidence just radiates from him. \n\"He was the youngest in the group last year and to be able to come in and compete as well as he did at the Combine and Pro Day and then get signed... it's unbelievable he was able to do it.\"\nAs for making that same transaction from Gaelic to American football, both McNamee and Bolger have worked hard on mastering a different kicking technique, with both likening it to perfecting a golf swing.\n\"The sweet spot in the ball in Gaelic is lower than on a ball in American football,\" McNamee explained.  \n\"Initially, I started kicking the ball too low which meant it was over-rotating and getting no distance.  So it was adjusting my angle and swing and once I'd found where the sweet spot was I was able to introduce power into it and dive a bit deeper into the foot angle, follow through, aim and finish.  \n\"I don't really think about it now \u2013 it's more natural and I kick that ball like I've been doing it for years.  As my technique's improved, I've added distance and there's more to come.\"\nFor Bolger, it's about doing the hard work in the gym away from the field. \n\"Once I was at college I realised there was more to it than biceps curls and looking in the mirror. At Idaho State, I was in the gym with the heavy weights on my back every day. That has helped with my kicking distance.  \n\"A lot of it is mastering technique too, of course. You have to learn to keep swinging your leg the same and keep your technique. You can overthink it sometimes, definitely.\"\n\nNFL fixtures and results\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

He wants more touches in the opposition box - and that figure more than doubled from his first game against Albania, increasing from 34 on Friday to 69 against Latvia.\nThey put in 36 crosses on a night when they enjoyed 73.5% possession, but the end product was poor. Marcus Rashford improved slightly on his performance against Albania, but Jarrod Bowen could not make the desired impact as a replacement for struggling Phil Foden.\nEngland sent in 21 of those crosses in the first half, the most in a game since they played Poland in October 2013 and delivered 25 - but their only goal game from James' free-kick.\nIn a sign of England's complete domination, they had 569 successful passes in Latvia's half compared to the visitors' 26 in theirs, and must be disappointed such overwhelming statistics resulted in relatively meagre results.\nTuchel wants to give England a fresh identity as they try to cross the psychological barrier from a nearly team to winners, but - as so often in the past - the acid test will only truly come when (it is hardly if) they qualify for the 2026 World Cup.\nQualifying should be a formality from a group that also contains Andorra and Serbia, so the first high-quality opponents England are likely to meet will be when they get to the World Cup. \nIt is a situation they have been in before - and then been found wanting when it matters.\nWho makes your England World Cup starting XI?\n'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?\nJude Bellingham was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card for a reckless challenge on Raivis Jurkovskis\nThis a problem for Tuchel to solve and one he will be well aware of.\nBut the 51-year-old will have enjoyed the spectacular strike from James, a player he greatly admires and who was a vital part of his Chelsea team that won the Champions League in 2021.\nKane's second was also right up the head coach's street, with Declan Rice accelerating into the Latvia area, collecting Morgan Rogers' pass and drilling a ball across the face of the six-yard box which left his captain with a simple finish.\nWhat will cheer Tuchel is that he has plenty of raw materials to work with.\nBellingham, for all the impetuosity that could - and should - have seen him sent off on Monday, is a generational talent, while Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has demonstrated he is a natural at this level.\nThere was more good news from The Hawthorns where another Gunner, Ethan Nwaneri, excelled in a goalscoring performance for England Under-21s - and the return of a third Arsenal player, Bukayo Saka, will offer an added attacking dimension.\nTuchel's task is to find the \"X Factor\", the missing ingredient, to get England's men over the line they have failed to cross since the 1966 World Cup.\nTwo wins from two games is a satisfactory - and totally expected - opening to the Tuchel era, but now he must discover the missing link to enable him to deliver the exciting England side he has promised.\nAnd on the somewhat tedious evidence of his first two games, Tuchel will have plenty to exercise his mind between now and the next international camp in June.",

He attended the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in history and anthropology. \nAfter finishing school, Blanchet worked as a teacher and later led a music non-profit in Montreal. \nThe year Blanchet was elected leader, the Bloc increased the number of seats it had in Parliament, overtaking the New Democrats to become the party with the third-most seats in the House of Commons. \nQuebec voters -  and the province's 78 federal ridings - have in the past dramatically affected election outcomes in Canada. \nThe Bloc's mandate is to be a voice for Quebec in Ottawa. \nAmong the big issues in Quebec right now is the global trade war launched by US President Donald Trump. The province is home to North America's largest primary aluminium production sector. \nTrump has put steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, which has already caused one Quebec aluminium plant - Alubar - to shut down its operations and layoff all 70 of its workers. \nBlanchet has called the tariffs \"ill-advised,\" and said that he believes \"at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail\"\nHe has also come out fiercely against President Donald Trump's musings about making Canada a 51st US state.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nIn responding to these emerging challenges from the US, Blanchet has not strayed away from putting Quebec front and centre in the conversation. \nHis party recently ran advertisements that asked: \"Who will speak for Quebec?\" \n\"We must prevent Quebec from becoming Canada's bargaining chip, speaking primarily for Toronto's banks, Ontario's auto industry, and Western oil companies,\" the advertisement read. \"On the contrary, Quebec must emerge stronger.\"\nThe province has long fiercely defended its identity, and in 2006, the House of Commons recognised that the \"Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois form a nation within a united Canada\".\nSince then, it has passed legislation defending its secularism laws and protecting use of the French language. \nBut threats from the US appear to have deeply worried Quebeckers, who have grown less supportive of Quebec sovereignty since Trump's \"51st state\" rhetoric. \nThose numbers have not deterred Blanchet, however, who said he believes the appetite for Quebec independence will \"come roaring back\" once US-Canada relations stabilise again. \nAs Canada gears up for an election this year, BBC wants to hear from voters across the country.

I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"\nHegseth reciprocated:\n\"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"\nA group member, only identified as \"SM\" suggested that after the strike, the US should \"make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return\".\n\"If Europe doesn't remunerate, then what?\" he asked.\n\"If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,\" the user continues.\nAccording to Goldberg, the US national security chief posted three emojis after the strike: \"a fist, an American flag, and fire\".\nThe Middle East special envoy, Steve Witkoff, responded with five emojis, Goldberg said: \"two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags\".\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles voiced messages of support, he said. \n\"I will say a prayer for victory,\" Vance said as updates on the strikes were given. \nTwo others members added prayer emojis, Goldberg reported.\nTo Vance's concerns that the action may be seen as going against Trump's message on Europe, the US defence secretary wrote: \n\"VP: I understand your concerns \u2013 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS [Trump]. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc).\n\"I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2013 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2013 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"\nThe Trump administration has consistently blamed Joe Biden for being too lenient with Iran.\nGoldberg said he got an unsolicited invitation on the Signal messaging platform on 11 March by an account named Michael Waltz, and was then added to the group chat about Yemen two days later. \nThe president was not part of this group, but Trump's closest collaborators were. \nGoldberg initially thought this was a hoax, but soon realised it was real. \nThe whole issue is adding pressure on the national security adviser, with Democrats in the House and Senate calling for an urgent inquiry.\nWhen asked on Monday about the whole incident, Trump said he didn't know anything, but he has stood by Waltz.\nThe defence secretary has also said no secrets were revealed. \n\"Nobody was texting war plans,\" he told journalists.",

        "article_text": "Saira Baloch was 15 when she stepped into a morgue for the first time.\nAll she heard in the dimly-lit room were sobs, whispered prayers and shuffling feet. The first body she saw was a man who appeared to have been tortured. \nHis eyes were missing, his teeth had been pulled out and there were burn marks on his chest.\n\"I couldn't look at the other bodies. I walked out,\" she recalled.\nBut she was relieved. It wasn't her brother - a police officer who had been missing for nearly a year since he was arrested in 2018 in a counter-terrorism operation in Balochistan, one of Pakistan's most restive regions.\nInside the morgue, others continued their desperate search, scanning rows of unclaimed corpses. Saira would soon adopt this grim routine, revisiting one morgue after another. They were all the same: tube lights flickering, the air thick with the stench of decay and antiseptic.\nOn every visit, she hoped she would not find what she was looking for - seven years on, she still hasn't. \nActivists say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared by Pakistan's security forces in the last two decades - allegedly detained without due legal process, or abducted, tortured and killed in operations against a decades-old separatist insurgency. \nThe Pakistan government denies the allegations, insisting that many of the missing have joined separatist groups or fled the country.\nSome return after years, traumatised and broken - but many never come back. Others are found in unmarked graves that have appeared across Balochistan, their bodies so disfigured they cannot be identified.\nAnd then there are the women across generations whose lives are being defined by waiting. \nYoung and old, they take part in protests, their faces lined with grief, holding up fading photographs of men no longer in their lives. When the BBC met them at their homes, they offered us black tea - Sulemani chai - in chipped cups as they spoke in voices worn down by sorrow. \nMany of them insist their fathers, brothers and sons are innocent and have been targeted for speaking out against state policies or were taken as a form of collective punishment.\nSaira is one of them. \nShe says she started going to protests after asking the police and pleading with politicians yielded no answers about her brother's whereabouts.\nMuhammad Asif Baloch was arrested in August 2018 along with 10 others in Nushki, a city along the border with Afghanistan. His family found out when they saw him on TV the next day, looking scared and dishevelled. \nAuthorities said the men were \"terrorists fleeing to Afghanistan\". Muhammad's family said he was having a picnic with friends.\nSaira says Muhammad was her \"best friend\", funny and always cheerful - \"My mother worries that she's forgetting his smile.\" \nThe day he went missing, Saira had aced a school exam and was excited to tell her brother, her \"biggest supporter\". Muhammad had encouraged her to attend universty in Quetta, the provincial capital. \n\"I didn't know back then that the first time I'd go to Quetta, it would be for a protest demanding his release,\" Saira says.  \nThree of the men who were detained along with her brother were released in 2021, but they have not spoken about what happened.\nMuhammad never came home.\nThe journey into Balochistan, in Pakistan's south-west, feels like you are stepping into another world. \nIt is vast - covering about 44% of the country, the largest of Pakistan's provinces - and the land is rich with gas, coal, copper and gold. It stretches along the Arabian Sea, across the water from places like Dubai, which has risen from the sands into glittering, monied skyscrapers.\nBut Balochistan remains stuck in time. Access to many parts is restricted for security reasons and foreign journalists are often denied access. \nIt's also difficult to travel around. The roads are long and lonely, cutting through barren hills and desert. As the infrastructure thins out the further you travel, roads are replaced by dirt tracks created by the few vehicles that pass. \nElectricity is sporadic, water even scarcer. Schools and hospitals are dismal.\nIn the markets, men sit outside mud shops waiting for customers who rarely come. Boys, who elsewhere in Pakistan may dream of a career, only talk of escape: fleeing to Karachi, to the Gulf, to anywhere that offers a way out of this slow suffocation.\nBalochistan became a part of Pakistan in 1948, in the upheaval that followed the partition of British India - and in spite of opposition from some influential tribal leaders, who sought an independent state. \nSome of the resistance turned militant and, over the years, it has been stoked by accusations that Pakistan has exploited the resource-rich region without investing in its development.\nMilitant groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), designated a terrorist group by Pakistan and other nations, have intensified their attacks: bombings, assassinations and ambushes against security forces have become more frequent.\nEarlier this month, the BLA hijacked a train in Bolan Pass, seizing hundreds of passengers. They demanded the release of missing people in Balochistan in return for freeing hostages. \nThe siege lasted over 30 hours. According to authorities, 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed. But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.\nThe disappearances in the province are widely believed to be part of Islamabad's strategy to crush the insurgency - but also to suppress dissent, weaken nationalist sentiment and support for an independent Balochistan.\nMany of the missing are suspected members or sympathisers of Baloch nationalist groups that demand more autonomy or independence. But a significant number are ordinary people with no known political affiliations.\nBalochistan's Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti told the BBC that enforced disappearances are an issue but dismissed the idea that they were happening on a large scale as \"systematic propaganda\".\n\"Every child in Balochistan has been made to hear 'missing persons, missing persons'. But who will determine who disappeared whom? \n\"Self-disappearances exist too. How can I prove if someone was taken by intelligence agencies, police, FC, or anyone else or me or you?\"\nPakistan's military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif recently said in a press conference that the \"state is solving the issue of missing persons in a systematic manner\". \nHe repeated the official statistic often shared by the government - of the more than 2,900 cases of enforced disappearances reported from Balochistan since 2011, 80% had been resolved. \nActivists put the figure higher - at around 7,000 \u2013 but there is no single reliable source of data and no way to verify either side's claims.\nWomen like Jannat Bibi refuse to accept the official number. \nShe continues to search for her son, Nazar Muhammad, who she claims was taken in 2012 while eating breakfast at a hotel. \n\"I went everywhere looking for him. I even went to Islamabad,\" she says. \"All I got were beatings and rejection.\"\nThe 70-year-old lives in a small mud house on the outskirts of Quetta, not far from a symbolic graveyard dedicated to the missing.\nJannat, who runs a tiny shop selling biscuits and milk cartons, often can't afford the bus fare to attend protests demanding information about the missing. But she borrows what she can so she can keep going.\n\"Silence is not an option,\" she says.\nMost of these men - including those whose families we spoke to - disappeared after 2006.\nThat was the year a key Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, was killed in a military operation, leading to a rise in anti-state protests and armed insurgent activities. \nThe government cracked down in response - enforced disappearances increased, as did the number of bodies found on the streets.\nIn 2014, mass graves of missing people were discovered in Tootak \u2013 a small town near the city of Khuzdar, where Saira lives, 275km (170 miles) south of Quetta. \nThe bodies were disfigured beyond identification. The images from Tootak shook the country - but the horror was no stranger to people in Balochistan.\nMahrang Baloch's father, a famous nationalist leader who fought for Baloch rights, had disappeared in early 2009. Abdul Gaffar Langove had worked for the Pakistani government but left the job to advocate for what he believed would be a safer Balochistan.\nThree years later Mahrang received a phone call that his body had been found in Lasbela district in the south of the province.\n\"When my father's body arrived, he was wearing the same clothes, now torn. He had been badly tortured,\" she says. For five years, she had nightmares about his final days. She visited his grave \"to convince myself that he was no longer alive and that he was not being tortured\". \nShe hugged his grave \"hoping to feel him, but it didn't happen\". \nWhen he was arrested, Mahrang used to write him letters -  \"lots of letters and I would draw greeting cards and send them to him on Eid\". But he returned the cards, saying his prison cell was no place for such \"beautiful\" cards. He wanted her to keep them at home. \n\"I still miss his hugs,\" she says. \nAfter her father's death, Mahrang says, her family's world \"collapsed\".\nAnd then in 2017,  her brother was picked up by security forces, according to the family, and detained for nearly three months.  \n\"It was terrifying. I made my mother believe that what happened to my father wouldn't happen to my brother. But it did,\" Mahrang says. \"I was scared of looking at my phone, because it might be news of my brother's body being found somewhere.\"\nShe says her mother and she found strength in each other: \"Our tiny house was our safest place, where we would sometimes sit and cry for hours. But outside, we were two strong women who couldn't be crushed.\"\nIt was then that Mahrang decided to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Today, the 32-year-old leads the protest movement despite death threats, legal cases and travel bans.\n\"We want the right to live on our own land without persecution. We want our resources, our rights. We want this rule of fear and violence to end.\"\nMahrang warns that enforced disappearances fuel more resistance, rather than silence it.\n\"They think dumping bodies will end this. But how can anyone forget losing their loved one this way? No human can endure this.\"\nShe demands institutional reforms, ensuring that no mother has to send her child away in fear. \"We don't want our children growing up in protest camps. Is that too much to ask?\"\nMahrang was arrested on Saturday morning, a few weeks after her interview with the BBC.\nShe was leading a protest in Quetta after 13 unclaimed bodies - feared to be missing persons - were buried in the city. Authorities claimed they were militants killed after the Bolan Pass train hijacking, though this could not be independently verified.\nEarlier Mahrang had said: \"I could be arrested anytime. But I don't fear it. This is nothing new for us.\"\nAnd even as she fights for the future she wants, a new generation is already on the streets.\nMasooma, 10, clutches her school bag tightly as she weaves through the crowd of protesters, her eyes scanning every face, searching for one that looks like her father's.\n\"Once, I saw a man and thought he was my father. I ran to him and then realised he was someone else,\" she says.\n\"Everyone's father comes home after work. I have never found mine.\"\nMasooma was just three months old when security forces allegedly took her father away during a late-night raid in Quetta. \nHer mother was told he would return in a few hours. He never did.\nToday, Masooma spends more time at protests than in the classroom. Her father's photograph is always with her, tucked safely in her school bag.\nBefore every lesson begins, she takes it out and looks at it.\n\"I always wonder if my father will come home today.\"\nShe stands outside the protest camp, chanting slogans with the others, her small frame lost in the crowd of grieving families.\nAs the protest comes to an end she sits cross-legged on a thin mat in a quiet corner. The noise of slogans and traffic fades as she pulls out her folded letters - letters she has written but could never send.\nHer fingers tremble as she smooths out the creases, and in a fumbling, uncertain voice, she begins to read them.\n\"Dear Baba Jan, when will you come back? Whenever I eat or drink water, I miss you. Baba, where are you? I miss you so much. I am alone. Without you, I cannot sleep. I just want to meet you and see your face.\"",

        "article_text": "There are few US presidential actions more sensitive, more fraught with peril, than when and where to use American military force.\nIf such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives \u2013 and national foreign policy objectives - at risk.\nFortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.\nUnfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.\nThe Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief, in an article posted on Monday on his publication's website, says he appears to have been inadvertently added to the chat by White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz.\nMembers of the group seemed to include Vice-President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others.\nA National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread \"appears to be authentic\".\nGoldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike \u2013 conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team.\n\"Amazing job,\" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March.\nHe followed up with emojis of a US flag, a fist and fire. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.\nThese White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.\nThat an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.\nAnd that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.\n\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.\nDemocratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.\n\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.\nCriticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.\nDon Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"\nWith Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.\n\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"\nTrump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.\nThe White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \nBy Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.\nIn its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.\nJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.\nWhile the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.\nHe noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"\nThe vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".\n\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\nThis is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.\nDick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.\nThis is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.\nLike this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.\nTheir revelation also proved to be political damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.\n\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.\nOn Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered an urgent investigation into the power outage caused by a substation fire that shut Heathrow Airport on Friday.\nThe investigation, led by the National Energy System Operator (NESO), would build a \"clear picture\" of the incident and UK's energy resilience more broadly to prevent it \"from ever happening again\", the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said.\n\"We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned,\" Miliband said.\nThe fire at the North Hyde substation in west London that supplies power to the airport led to thousands of cancelled flights on Friday and stranded passengers across the world.\nOn Sunday Heathrow said it would be operating \"another full schedule\" with more than 1,300 flights after more than 250,000 passengers passed through the airport on Saturday. \n\"We have welcomed the Government's announcement of an investigation into the cause and response to the off-airport power outage and have launched a review, to be chaired by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly, of Heathrow's response,\" a statement from the airport added. \nMore than 63,000 homes lost power in the outage caused by the fire, according to energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. About 150 people were evacuated from surrounding properties.\nThe Met Police has said that counter-terrorism officers were \"leading inquiries\" but are not treating the incident as suspicious.\nMiliband said he has commissioned the investigation to \"understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future\".\nNESO, which operates Britain's electricity grid, is expected to report to the power regulator Ofgem and the government in six weeks with its initial findings.\nNearly 1,400 flights were disrupted by the airport's closure, according to air traffic website flightradar24.com. Around 120 flights were diverted elsewhere.\nSeparately, Heathrow has announced a review of the airport's response to the power outage and its crisis management plans will be undertaken by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly.\nThe airport said it was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, but the chaos has raised questions about the resilience of the major transport hub.\nFifty slots were added to Saturday's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through it, the airport said.\nOn Saturday, more than 30 flights due to depart from the airport were cancelled and more than 15 were delayed, according to Heathrow's live departure board.\nIt also showed that more than 70 flights expected to arrive at the airport had been cancelled, including from Doha, Riyadh, Dubai, Manchester, and Newcastle Upon Tyne.\nFarah Rafeeq was due to travel with a friend from Heathrow to Cambodia on Friday to attend a friend's wedding but the mass cancellation of flights has meant she will miss part of the ceremony.\nThe 24-year-old found an alternative flight from Gatwick Airport that will get them to Cambodia for Sunday afternoon in time for the wedding reception but said they had to pay \"double the amount\" for a the new flight.\nIn Miami, Charlotte and her family were heading to Heathrow on Thursday night when their American Airlines plane was \"turned around mid-flight\", she said.\n\"I have been stranded in Miami with my infant one year-old and three year-old son since then,\" she told the BBC.\nShe said the family had been \"passed around from hotel to hotel\", but now hopes to be booked on a flight on Sunday.\nAn American Airlines spokesperson said it has been \"working around the clock to get customers on their way\" to Heathrow \"as quickly and efficiently as possible\", adding that it was providing overnight accommodation to passengers affected by the airport's closure.\nSubstations, operated by National Grid, are designed to produce, convert, and distribute electricity at suitable voltage levels. Heathrow uses three electricity substations, each with a backup.\nThere are also backup diesel generators, and uninterruptible battery-powered supplies which provide enough power to keep safety critical systems such as aircraft landing systems running.\nHowever, when the fire broke out the substation, it was out of action, along with its backup.\nHeathrow's main fall-back was the two remaining substations, but the airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, told the BBC that it \"takes time\" to \"switch them\".\nHe said the incident was \"not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences\".\nIn a statement released on Saturday evening, Mr Woldbye welcomed the investigation, saying that \"we will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident\".\nHeathrow's chairman Lord Paul Deighton said the airport regrets the disruption caused and hopes people affected \"understand that the decision was made in order to prioritise the safety of our passengers and colleagues\".\nHe added that the airport is \"committed to finding any potential learnings from this unprecedented incident\" when its review is conducted.\nAdditional reporting by Kris Bramwell.

Investigation ordered into power outage that closed Heathrow12 hours agoShareSaveHollie Cole and Tom SymondsBBC NewsShareSavePA MediaEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered an urgent investigation into the power outage caused by a substation fire that shut Heathrow Airport on Friday.The investigation, led by the National Energy System Operator (NESO), would build a \"clear picture\" of the incident and UK's energy resilience more broadly to prevent it \"from ever happening again\", the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said. Heathrow uses three electricity substations, each with a backup.There are also backup diesel generators, and uninterruptible battery-powered supplies which provide enough power to keep safety critical systems such as aircraft landing systems running.However, when the fire broke out the substation, it was out of action, along with its backup.Heathrow's main fall-back was the two remaining substations, but the airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, told the BBC that it \"takes time\" to \"switch them\".He said the incident was \"not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences\".In a statement released on Saturday evening, Mr Woldbye welcomed the investigation, saying that \"we will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident\".Heathrow's chairman Lord Paul Deighton said the airport regrets the disruption caused and hopes people affected \"understand that the decision was made in order to prioritise the safety of our passengers and colleagues\".He added that the airport is \"committed to finding any potential learnings from this unprecedented incident\" when its review is conducted.Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell. \"We have welcomed the Government's announcement of an investigation into the cause and response to the off-airport power outage and have launched a review, to be chaired by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly, of Heathrow's response,\" a statement from the airport added.",

I love playing football, so I'm never going to complain about playing football.\n\"I think if you manage it well, with your coaches and your manager and your clubs, there are ways of getting more rest in certain moments.\n\"But it's not an easy question, it's not an easy situation. I think there could be a balance from both sides, but we'd have to see how that pans out.\"\nKane's comments echo those made by Liverpool's Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker last September, while Manchester City and Switzerland's 29-year-old defender Manuel Akanji has previously said he may have to retire after his next birthday because of the fixture schedule.\nThe Professional Footballers' Association also joined a legal action against Fifa last summer over the \"overloaded and unworkable\" football calendar.\nKane scored his 71st international goal in England's 3-0 win over Latvia in a World Cup qualifier on Monday and is 20 appearances behind Peter Shilton's 125-cap record.\nVictory over Latvia handed new England boss Thomas Tuchel a second win in as many games at the start of his tenure following an opening 2-0 victory over Albania on Friday.\nTuchel's side will reconvene in June for their World Cup qualifier with Andorra before a friendly with Senegal, during a window which the German says could be moved in the calendar.\n\"I am not so concerned about the amount of games the players play in total,\" he said. \n\"I am more concerned that they never have a real break of three to four weeks.\n\"Maybe they have three weeks holiday but maybe after five days they play another competition.

        "article_text": "This is the gravest crisis for Western security since the end of World War Two, and a lasting one. As one expert puts it, \"Trumpism will outlast his presidency\". But which nations are equipped to step to the fore as the US stands back?\nAt 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.\nExhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.\nThe United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.\nAlmost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.\n\"It must be a policy of the United States,\" President Harry Truman announced, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.\"\nIt was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.\nThere followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.\nIt is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had. \nThe United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image. \nThe baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.\nYet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.\nDonald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.\nThe question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?\nPresident Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.\n\"For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,\" he wrote in 1987. \"Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?\n\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.\"\nIt's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration. \nAnd the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.\nIn the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"\nAnother account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"\nTrump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia. \nMany saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.\nOn the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share. \nTo some, Putin is an ally in a \"war on woke\".\nThe United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for. \nSome think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end. \n\"The US is becoming divorced from European values,\" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. \"\n\"I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.\"\nThe Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.\n\"If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.\nFor almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all. \nIn Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.\nOthers are less sure.\nBen Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life support. \n\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.\n\"Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack\u2026 I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"\nAccording to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.\n\"The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,\" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.\n\"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".\nAnd yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.\"\nAll of this is great news for Putin. \"The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,\" he said last year. \"Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.\"\nIn early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared \"the fragmentation of the West has begun\".\n\"Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,\" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. \"Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.\n\"And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?\"\nOne of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed. \nBritain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)\n\"We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,\" says Wallace. \"Now, you could argue that that was warranted.\n\"The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.\"\nThe prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?\n\"It isn't enough just to stand still,\" argues Wallace. \"It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.\"\nThen there is the wider question of military recruitment. \"The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,\" argues Wallace.\n\"At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.\"\nBut Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And \"Europeanising\" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.\nOthers share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.\n\"Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,\" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. \"The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.\"\nMr Arnold agrees: \"The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.\"\nThere is a short list of \"very important things\" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash. \n\"These are the so-called strategic enablers,\" he says. \"The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.\n\"And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.\"\nThe question is how to achieve this.\nMs van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.\n\"What's really difficult are the divisions within Europe on how to actually do this and whether to actually do this.\"\nThe European Commission and experts have been trying to figure out how this defence may work for several decades. \"It has traditionally been very difficult because of vested national interests... So this is not going to be easy.\"\nIn the meantime, Trump appears ready to turn the page on the post-Cold War rules-based international order of sovereign states that are free to choose their own destinies and alliances.\nWhat he seems to share with Vladimir Putin is a desire for a world in which the major powers, unconstrained by internationally agreed laws, are free to impose their will on smaller, weaker nations, as Russia has traditionally done in both its Tsarist and Soviet Empires. That would mean a return to the \"spheres of interest\" system that prevailed for 40 years after the Second World War.\nWe don't know exactly what Donald Trump would do were a Nato country to be attacked. But the point is that the guarantee of US help can no longer be taken for granted. That means Europe has to react. Its challenge appears to be to stay united, finally make good on funding its own defence, and avoid being drawn into the \"sphere of influence\" of any of the big powers.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

By one man. With a particular interest in stamps.\nDr Borthwick explains that \"panic\" first set in when a National Records of Scotland (NRS) employee attended an auction in London in 1994.\nThey discovered that 200 of the items up for sale belonged to NRS.\nThese should have been safely in Scotland's archives, not being offloaded to the highest bidder via a bang of the auctioneer's gavel.\nNRS can date back all their archive users to 1847. After some cross referencing, Dr Borthwick and his team realised that the auction items all linked back to one person \u2013 Prof David Stirling Macmillan.\nProf Macmillan was born in 1925 and was from Girvan, Ayrshire. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and studied history at the University of Glasgow.\nHis right to use the national archives had been revoked in 1980 when he was caught removing a document. Staff assumed this was a one-off.\nBut the truth was that Prof Macmillan had been helping himself since 1949.\nThe 200 items that turned up in the London auction were the tip of the iceberg.\nNow National Records of Scotland are revealing the scale of his thefts. And the odd nature of them.\nProf Macmillan wasn't pinching documents that were worth a lot of money, or even those that were particularly historically significant.\nThe archives include letters from Robert Burns and Mary Queen of Scots. But these weren't his targets.\nThe contents of many of the letters he took are mundane, perhaps even boring.\nBut a lifelong interest in stamps and postmarks seem to have led to him taking letters that caught his eye. Including documents dating back to 1637.\nOne example was a letter from a Scot who'd moved to the island of Madeira, off the north west coast of Africa. In 1813 they wrote to a friend with some news and gossip. Not exactly explosive stuff.\nAnd yet Prof Macmillan ripped it out of the book it was stored in and pocketed it.\nWe can't be certain about the motivations involved, but the interesting postmark and wax seal on the document are thought to be what tempted the professor.\nThe thief went to great lengths to cover his tracks.\nHe would remove reference numbers from documents and sometimes replace what he had taken with forgeries.\nIronically, Prof Macmillan was himself a professional archivist. He held that role at the University of Sydney and even placed an appeal for historical papers in the university newspaper.\nThe man who spent years stealing documents stressed they would be \"properly looked after\" and bemoaned the fact that so much of history had been \"destroyed or lost\".\nThe academic moved to Trent University in Canada in 1968 and spent 20 years teaching history, though he still seems to have made annual visits to Scotland's archives. He died in 1987, leaving no immediate family.\nMuch of his collection then found its way into the archives of Trent University, where they remained for some time. They were catalogued and descriptions were put online.\nIn 2012. Dr Alan Borthwick was still trying to track down what had been taken. He realised that thousands of the Trent University items rightly belonged to NRS and other UK institutions.\nDr Borthwick was dispatched to North America to investigate.\nHe says he was amazed by the \"sheer quantity of documents\" he found that had been stolen by Prof Macmillan.\nThe chief executive of NRS, Alison Byrne, echoes this. She described the scale of Prof Macmillan's thefts as \"unprecedented\".\nShe only took up her role six months ago, and was appalled when she was filled in on the situation.\nSecuring the return of these documents was one thing. But finding their rightful home was arguably the bigger task.\nFor decades, Dr Borthwick and his team have been \"piecing together the jigsaw\", undertaking the painstaking process of finding the correct place for all of these stolen items.\nFor context, National Records of Scotland are the custodians of 38 million documents. \nThey have 50 miles (80km) of shelving \u2013 enough to stretch from Edinburgh to Glasgow.\nTheir archives are all about precision \u2013 every document has an exact home that makes locating it straightforward.\nThe team wanted to get each item that Prof Macmillan had taken brought back to its rightful place.\nFortunately, NRS \"daybooks\" show what he was signing out of the archives. But his attempts to cover his tracks and remove identifying marks complicated the challenge.\nNow National Records of Scotland say they have got almost everything back where it should be, ready to be pored over by a new generation of historians.\nBut, for Dr Borthwick, how does it feel to know that a fellow archivist so egregiously abused the trust that was put in him?\nThe historian labels it \"a kick in the teeth\". He's been trying to undo the damage done by Prof Macmillan for almost all of his working life.\nThat time could have been spent on other historical projects.\nBut Dr Borthwick reflects that there's a \"sense of satisfaction\" in solving the mystery of the missing documents.\nDocuments that, these days, are kept under the watchful eye of CCTV.",

        "article_text": "As an asteroid mining start-up's latest mission goes awry, Josh Sims looks at how close we really are to extracting rare minerals from the many celestial bodies above us.\nThirty years ago the seminal BBC science programme Tomorrow's World made a few predictions about how the world might be by 2025. It was a testament to how hard predicting the technological future is: we would, the programme suggested, have microchip implants to help us deal with ATMs, chat with holographic helpmates in our homes and there would be riots over internet access.\nThe episode\u00a0also suggested we would be mining asteroids\u00a0by now. And while we aren't there yet, it's something that some start-ups argue will happen sooner than many imagined.\nThe founder of the California-based company\u00a0AstroForge\u00a0believes it will be the first to get there, and the company has already taken the first tentative steps. On 27 February 2025 it\u00a0launched its first\u00a0$6.5m (\u00a35.1m) unmanned spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Around nine days later, AstroForge believes the spacecraft \u2013\u00a0named Odin \u2013 likely passed beyond the Moon and into deep space as planned.\nUnfortunately, however, AstroForge developed major communications problems with Odin, which it is still trying to rectify at the time of writing. The firm hopes Odin has now entered its nine-month long coast to its mission destination: a fly-by of the carefully pre-selected asteroid 2022 OB5, some eight million km (five million miles) from Earth, which Odin will assess the composition of using its sensors.\n\"Move fast and break rocks\" might be the mantra of Matt Gialich, AstroForge's ebullient founder with a penchant for swear words, who is not dissuaded by the perhaps unresolvable technical trouble. AstroForge expected nothing less than many hurdles and has, he says, learned much even if contact isn't made with this spacecraft again. \"Yes, there are a lot more baby steps to take,\" he concedes. \"But we're going to start to actually do it. You have to try.\"\nFollowing a further launch next year, the company plans to develop ways to mine near-Earth asteroids for the valuable, concentrated metals some contain \u2013 particularly the platinum-group metals essential to much of our fuel cell and renewable technology. Scientists have highlighted that these are increasingly costly to mine on Earth \u2013 financially, environmentally, socially and even geopolitically.\nBut others question whether mining these metals in space and bringing them back to Earth is really feasible, especially in the near term \u2013 and whether it could have its own unique, but just as impactful, environmental costs.\nGialich hopes that over subsequent test launches over the next decade, AstroForge will recover small quantities of metal \u2013 initially a few grams, working up to kilograms as its programme advances \u2013 from target asteroids of a few metres to half a kilometre in diameter. Early hauls would likely not be commercial but, Gialich says, depending on the metals extracted, could take them on the way to commercialisation. Just one kilogram of rhodium, for example, is\u00a0currently priced at\u00a0$183,000 (\u00a3141,000).\nIt certainly sounds optimistic. But Victor Vescovo \u2013 one of the firm's main investors and the explorer who built a submersible that in 2019 made him\u00a0the first person to visit the bottom of all five oceans\u00a0\u2013 feels that the technical challenges are \"just a question of developing the tools\".\n\"Bring back a few micrograms to show it can be done and then scaling the process up is relatively straightforward,\" he says. \"To fully realise asteroid mining may be a multi-decade project. But it's just a mathematical problem.\" While it's no doubt a major engineering feat to pull off, he adds, taking samples of material direct from asteroids has already been done by state space agencies, including Japan's\u00a0Jaxa with Hayabusa 1\u00a0and\u00a02\u00a0back in 2005 and 2014, and NASA with its\u00a0Osiris-Rex mission\u00a0in 2020.\nAnd if the idea of mining asteroid seems outlandish, Vescovo argues, many technological breakthroughs \u2013\u00a0the Wright brothers' first manned flight, for example\u00a0\u2013 have likewise carried the same burden. Until, that is, they actually happen.\nIan Lange, associate professor at the Colorado School of Mines, an engineering research institution with a space resource programme, stresses that we can currently only estimate the technological hurdles of asteroid mining. A spacecraft rendezvousing with an asteroid may be only marginally more complicated than doing so with another spacecraft, he notes. But how, for example, might resources be extracted without the stabilising force of gravity?\n\"Mining \u2013 separating ore from dirt \u2013 is relatively straightforward, but then some kind of chemical or heat process, and gravity, is required to separate what we want from what we don't,\" Lange says. \"Reproducing that in space is going to be much harder. At this stage it's hard to say whether [established] techniques can be employed or whether [the asteroid mining industry] will have to develop entirely new ones.\"\nThe idea of asteroid mining was largely the stuff of academic interest until the 1980s, when Nasa began to formulate ideas of just how space resources might be gathered, says Lange. These ideas gathered pace with growing environmental concerns during the 1990s, he adds. Indeed, since then several private companies the likes of Moon Express, Planetary Resources or Deep Space Industries struggled against the high development costs. By the end of the 2010s, the latter two were acquired and directed towards other projects. Small wonder Lange believes the combination of business and technological challenges means that asteroid mining is still another 30 years away.\nThe real game-changer, argues Vescovo, has been the technological pace of change over the last 10 years. New observatories, such as the nearly complete Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile, will soon offer better tracking of asteroids. Optics and spectrographic analysis are affording easier identification of those that look to be candidates for mining \u2013 even if quite how many of these there are remains open to debate. Powerful computing has become more widely available. And there are more, and more affordable, off-the-shelf components with which spacecraft can be built.\n\"It wasn't long ago that only governments could do this kind of thing or had access to the technology, and they never used it with much efficiency,\" says Joel Sercel, founder of TransAstra, a Los-Angeles-based company developing various technologies for the fledgling asteroid mining sector. TransAstra will be running a demonstration of its inflatable \"capture bag\" tech for the collection of orbital debris on the International Space Station later this year. \"Now we have a vibrant private space business that's going to make asteroid mining happen vastly sooner than people predict.\"\nThe most crucial development for asteroid mining is that it has become far easier and cheaper than ever to get a payload into orbit, due to the privatisation of the space industry and its development of reusable rockets.\n\"We've gone from it costing $10,000 (\u00a37,850) to put 1lb (450g) into space 15 years ago, to a few thousand now,\" says Vescovo. \"And with the likes of Space X's Starship the prospect of it costing hundreds of dollars in the near future.\"\nThe astrophysicist and science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson has said that the first trillionaire will come through asteroid mining, \"I do hope he's not wrong,\" laughs Vescovo. Either way, he believes asteroid mining will prove essential to stop metal mining's ongoing despoliation of the Earth.\nLange, however, is sceptical of AstroForge's plans: yes, asteroid mining will likely prove technologically possible, he reckons, but he is much less certain about Astroforge's platinum group-focussed business model. \"While Earth remains rich in [these resources], even if at the bottom of the sea, that still means a tonne of possibilities [to attain them] that are certainly easier than collecting them from space,\" he says. \"If, that is, we allow ourselves to take them.\"\nBut Kathryn Miller, an environmental scientist at the University of Lancaster argues that asteroid mining could make for an environmentally more attractive option than, say,\u00a0deep-sea mining\u00a0\u2013 the still theoretical but\u00a0soon to be regulated\u00a0proposal to scrape the seabed for resources. While terrestrial mining is also \"[not] exactly good\u2026given the habitat destruction, the social justice issues and so on\u2026 gathering the nodules of cobalt and copper from the seafloor isn't just a matter of removing the substrate, but destroying the seabed,\" Miller says.\nOf course, getting rockets into space and back is\u00a0highly polluting and energy intensive\u00a0but then so is mining. A 2018 study from researchers at the University of Paris\u2013Saclay compared\u00a0mining platinum on Earth to a\u00a0projection\u00a0of mining it from asteroids. The researchers estimated that 150kg of CO2 would be emitted into the Earth's atmosphere for each kilogram of platinum mined from an asteroid. Producing 1kg of platinum on Earth using current practices, meanwhile, generates 40,000kg. This is essentially down to their\u00a0rarity on Earth: the Earth's upper crust is only 0.0005 parts per million platinum, with even the most productive mines currently operating at around five to 15 parts per million.\nDaynan Crull, the founder of asteroid mining company Karman+, thinks the future of asteroid mining lies more realistically in the search for resources to build an economy\u00a0in\u00a0space. The\u00a0World Economic Forum predicts\u00a0the space economy will be worth a staggering $1.8 trillion (\u00a31.4 trillion) by 2035.\nMining in space could shift the balance of power between often developing nations naturally rich in minerals and developed ones able to harness the technology required to harvest them in space, argues Deganit Paikowsky, a scholar at George Washington University Space Policy Institute who researches the politics of space mining. Deganit is wary of the potential disruption to the status quo that asteroid mining might bring.\n\"It's one thing to mine resources in space for use in space\u00a0\u2013 look at the leading space-faring nations now and they're more about creating an enduring human presence in space, so exploiting materials to that end is logical,\" she says. \"But it's another thing to bring those resources back to Earth for use in an [established] Earth economy. That's going to impact many different stakeholders in many ways.\"\nWhen it comes to asteroid mining, says Crull, the headline grabbers tend to be platinum group metals, along with other resources that might be mined, such as rare earths and the helium-3 required for nuclear fusion. But, he says, consider mining of water for its life-sustaining oxygen and rocket propellant hydrogen, or of clay for the 3D printing of ceramics that can be used to make, say, space habitats or solar collectors. Mining would circumvent much of the costs of getting these into space from Earth entirely.\n\"We looked at bringing asteroid resources back to Earth but the feasibility and economics seem fuzzy to us,\" says Crull. Instead, Karman+ is looking to mine resources in space to then be used in space, for making space habitats or in the maintenance of satellites, for example. Karman+ has recently raised $20m (\u00a315.4m) institutional investment and has a launch for its first spacecraft \u2013 to test sampling capabilities \u2013 booked for February 2027.\nIt still leaves many unanswered questions. Is this just swapping one kind of environmental damage for another? Some have expressed concern about the creation of space tailings \u2013 the rubble left over from asteroids once they're mined. They worry about the problem of how to dispose of this waste and, like other space debris, that it otherwise might eventually fall to Earth. Scientists such as Monica Grady, a professor of planetary and space sciences at The Open University in the UK, have argued that space's pristine environment should not be tarnished, with humans instead learning \"to clean up as we go along\".\nGialich, however, argues that the resources in space should instead be viewed as a way to protect those on Earth. \"There's infinite space out there and countless asteroids but only one Earth,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 What does spending a long time in space do to the human body?\n\u2022 Where did asteroid 2024 YR4 come from?\n\u2022 The satellites that will skim the sky\nThere's one more question that needs answered, though, before we start buying asteroid resources mined by these companies here Earth: are they really theirs to sell? That is some way off being decided, says Rosanna Deplano, a professor of international space law at the University of Leicester in the UK and an advisor to the Asteroid Mining Corporation, a London-based space mining company.\nThe 1967 Outer Space Treaty, the oldest but most widely ratified agreement on international space law \u2013 signed by 115 countries \u2013 says we should treat space as a commons but makes no reference to its resources. \"So that implies [mining is] not forbidden,\" says Deplano.\nThe 1979 Moon Agreement, meanwhile, says that the Moon's natural resources shouldn't become anyone's property \u2013 but that has only been ratified by seven states, including Chile, the Netherlands and Morocco, and none of which to date have their own manned spaceflight programmes. A United Nations special committee is set to convene in 2027 to discuss the utilisation of space resources, but any pronouncement won't be legally-binding.\nIndeed, as indicated by discussions between the US and Ukraine on a potential deal over Ukraine's mineral resources, it may be that national interests could take precedence. \"If the extraction from asteroids is for scientific research I don't think it will be terribly problematic,\" says Deplano. \"But the problem arises on the political level when it's commercial.\"\nCountries are already giving interpretations on this issue from their own national perspectives, she adds. \"That's only incentivising commercialisation.

This is essentially down to their\u00a0rarity on Earth: the Earth's upper crust is only 0.0005 parts per million platinum, with even the most productive mines currently operating at around five to 15 parts per million.Daynan Crull, the founder of asteroid mining company Karman+, thinks the future of asteroid mining lies more realistically in the search for resources to build an economy\u00a0in\u00a0space. Mining would circumvent much of the costs of getting these into space from Earth entirely. But the problem arises on the political level when it's commercial \u2013 Rosanna DeplanoMining in space could shift the balance of power between often developing nations naturally rich in minerals and developed ones able to harness the technology required to harvest them in space, argues Deganit Paikowsky, a scholar at George Washington University Space Policy Institute who researches the politics of space mining.",

        "article_text": "A mother in northern Nigeria is visibly upset as she clutches her two-year-old child, who has burns and discoloured skin on his face and legs.\nThe 32-year-old used skin-whitening products on all six of her children, under pressure from her family, with results that she now deeply regrets.\nFatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.\nAnother was left with darker skin than before - with a pale circle around her eyes, while a third has whitish scars on her lips and knees.\nHer toddler still has weeping wounds - his skin is taking a long time to heal.\n\"My sister gave birth to light-skinned children but my children are darker skinned. I noticed that my mother favours my sister's children over mine due to their skin tone and it hurt my feelings a lot,\" Fatima says.\nShe says she used creams she bought at her local supermarket in the city of Kano, without a doctor's prescription.\nAt first it seemed to work. The grandmother warmed towards Fatima's children, who were aged between two and 16 at the time. \nBut then the burns and scars appeared.\nSkin-whitening or lightening, also known as bleaching in Nigeria, is used in different parts of the world for cosmetic reasons, though these often have deep cultural roots.\nWomen in Nigeria use skin-whitening products more than in any other African country - 77% use them regularly, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO). \nIn Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.\nThe creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription. \nOther ingredients sometimes used are the poisonous metal, mercury, and kojic acid - a by-product from the manufacture of the Japanese alcoholic drink, sake.\nDermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.\nThe skin may become thinner, with the result that wounds take longer to heal, and are more likely to become infected, the WHO says.\nThe situation is so bad that Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) declared a state of emergency in 2023.\nIt is also becoming more common for women to bleach their children, like Fatima did.\n\"A lot of people link light skin to beauty or wealth. Women tend to shield, as they call it, their children from that discrimination by bleaching them from childbirth,\" Zainab Bashir Yau, the owner of a dermatology clinic in the capital, Abuja, tells the BBC.\nShe estimates that 80% of the women she has met have bleached their children, or plan to do so.\nSome were bleached themselves as babies, she says, so are just continuing the practice.\nOne of the most common ways to tell whether someone is using skin-whitening products in Nigeria is by the darkness of their knuckles. Other parts of people's hands or feet get lighter, but knuckles tend to remain dark.\nHowever, smokers and drug users also sometimes have dark patches on their hands, due to the smoke.\nSo users of skin-lightening products are sometimes mistakenly assumed to belong to this group.\nFatima says that is what happened to her daughters, aged 16 and 14.\n\"They faced discrimination from society - they all point fingers at them and call them drug addicts. This has affected them a lot,\" she says.\nThey have both lost potential fianc\u00e9s because men do not want to be associated with women who might be thought to take drugs.\nI visited a popular market in Kano, where people who call themselves \"mixologists\" create skin-whitening creams from scratch.\nThe market has a whole row of shops where thousands of these creams are sold. \nSome pre-mixed varieties are arranged on shelves, but customers can also select raw ingredients and ask for the cream to be mixed in front of them.\nI noticed that many bleaching creams, with labels saying they were for babies, contained regulated substances.\nOther sellers admitted using regulated ingredients such as kojic acid, hydroquinone and a powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which may cause rashes and other side-effects.\nI also witnessed teenage girls buying bleaching creams for themselves and in bulk so that they could sell them to their peers.\nOne woman, who had discoloured hands, insisted that a seller add a lightening agent to a cream that was being mixed for her children, even though it was a regulated substance for adults and illegal to use on children.\n\"Even though my hands are discoloured, I am here to buy creams for my kids so they can be light-skinned. I believe my hands are this way just because I used the wrong one. Nothing will happen to my children,\" she said.\nOne seller said most of his customers were buying creams to make their babies \"glow\", or to look \"radiant and shiny\".\nMost seemed to be unaware of the approved dosages.\nOne salesman said he used \"a lot of kojic\" - well over the prescribed limit - if someone wanted light skin and a smaller quantity if they wanted a subtler change.\nThe approved dosage of kojic acid in creams in Nigeria is 1%, according to Nafdac.\nI even saw salesmen giving women injections.\nDr Leonard Omokpariola, a director at Nafdac, says attempts are being made to educate people about the risks.\nHe also says markets are being raided, and there are efforts to seize skin-lightening ingredients at Nigeria's borders as they are brought into the country.\nBut he says it was sometimes hard for law-enforcement officials to identify these substances.\n\"Some of them are just being transported in unlabelled containers, so if you do not take them to the labs for evaluation, you can't tell what is inside.\"\nFatima says her actions will haunt her forever, especially if her children's scars do not fade.\n\"When I confided in my mum about what I did, due to her behaviour, and when she heard the dangers of the cream and what stigma her grandchildren are facing, she was sad that they had to go through that and apologised,\" she says.\nFatima is determined to help other parents avoid making the same mistake.\n\"Even though I have stopped... the side-effects are still here, I beg other parents to use my situation as an example.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

Because game 13 would be September's Rugby World Cup final at Allianz Stadium.\nContinuity in their Six Nations opener against Italy in York would have been the safe option as the Red Roses bid for a seventh successive championship.\nInstead, Mitchell opted against playing his dazzling back three of Jessica Breach, Abby Dow and Ellie Kildunne, who started every game and scored a combined 18 tries in last year's Grand Slam-winning campaign.\nThere was also no space for regular scrum-half Natasha Hunt or centre Tatyana Heard, while experienced number eight Alex Matthews sat out because of suspension.\nRugby Union Weekly: Women's Six Nations - week one review\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nFrom the win over Canada that secured England's WXV1 title success in October, Mitchell made seven changes and some positional alterations to his starting XV, with the result a comfortable 38-5 victory in front of 8,391 supporters in York.\nIn the early stages, no drop-off was evident. The Red Roses started in clinical fashion, the returning Claudia MacDonald scoring the bonus-point try inside 30 minutes.\nBut the second half was more of a struggle for England, who came up against a much-improved Italy and were limited to Emma Sing's try in the closing minutes.\n\"It's a really good start. We had new combinations and built really good pressure,\" Mitchell told BBC Sport.\n\"What let the pressure off was a little bit of [lack of] urgency to the breakdown and then execution was probably the only thing that let us down in terms of building pressure in the second half.\n\"We wanted to build pressure and we have got started with that, but Italy threw a few punches at us as well and we had to deal with that.\n\"If we don't get punches, how do you learn to get better? I think we will be better for that. Next week [against Wales] will be a new combination again. We have a bit of work to do on cohesion.\"\nMia Venner (left) and Claudia MacDonald both scored tries for England in the first half against Italy\nEngland's fresh-looking back three scored 21 points in York and proved more than able replacements in the first half.\nGloucester-Hartpury wing Mia Venner, 22, was playing her first Red Roses game in five years. She looked a threat from her first touch, with her sharp footwork and lethal speed opening the scoring with a well-deserved try.\nCreating a dual playmaker system by shifting Holly Aitchison to inside centre and starting versatile back Helena Rowland at fly-half was another new combination which helped England get an advantage in the wider channels in the first 40 minutes.\nDebutant GB Sevens player Jade Shekells brought a physical presence off the bench to bounce off multiple Italian defenders, while replacement scrum-half Flo Robinson, through various snipes, also looked bright on her first cap.\n\"One of the challenges John's got is giving debuts and giving game time to young players, but trying to create synergy in the side,\" former England head coach Simon Middleton told BBC Sport.\n\"There were lots of changes and it's really hard to get cohesion.\"\nMitchell - Middleton's successor - believes it is likely to be during the middle of the tournament when England will start clicking \"connection-wise\".\nMaggie Alphonsi, a 2014 World Cup winner with England, added: \"John's thinking about the end [the World Cup] in mind. He's got to accept that there are going to be errors and there are learnings from it. We also knew that they weren't going to be perfect today.\n\"The key thing is about making sure they develop that cohesion and build those combinations.\n\"It's about peaking at the right time. New Zealand have done it several times, they've peaked at the right time for a World Cup and they've had errors along the way.\"\nEngland, who are chasing a fourth successive Grand Slam, next face Wales at Principality Stadium on Saturday.\nWith their winning streak now at 21 games, another England victory is expected, especially following Wales' opening-round defeat by Scotland.\nWhether Mitchell continues to tinker with his side is less predictable, as he continues to develop his winning-machine in the year that will define his side's success.",

        "article_text": "People will be far more open-minded than you realise if you adopt these simple conversational techniques.\n\"The growth of knowledge depends entirely upon disagreement,\" claimed the philosopher Karl Popper. He was writing about the dangers of dogma in science \u2013 but his words could equally apply to anyone's worldview. And if you want a disagreement to end by changing someone's mind, you have to do it in the right way.\nAs I found in my recent book on social connection, new psychological research can help us to have more constructive conversations about controversial issues.\u00a0\nSome of the strategies surprised me. While some social media users are keen to remind us that \"facts don't care about your feelings\", studies suggest that people are considerably more likely to listen to our arguments if we talk about our personal experiences of the issues under discussion.\nOne of the main drivers of serious disagreement was apparent in the recent Friendship Study, which comprised a questionnaire I devised with psychologist Ian MacRae, offered to BBC.com readers in July and August of last year.\nIn one section, participants were asked to imagine a discussion with someone who disagreed with them about certain political or social issues. Afterwards, each participant was asked about their intentions \u2013 whether they aimed to persuade the other person, learn from them, or argue with them \u2013 and also their impression of the other person's intentions. Overall, the 1,912 participants overestimated how much other people wanted to persuade them of their point of view, and how much they were looking for an argument. At the same time, they underestimated how much the other person wanted to learn and understand the different opinions.\nThis is worth remembering whenever we find ourselves in a conflict: the other person may be more open to a good-faith discussion than we think, and we should treat them with the respect that entails.\nGiven that our conversation partner might underestimate our curiosity about their views, we should also make more effort to express our interest in their views. By demonstrating our good intentions to learn and understand, we will encourage them to lower their defences so that they are more open to an honest exchange of ideas.\nOften it is as simple as asking the right question. In the late 2000s, Frances Chen and colleagues at Stanford University invited students to engage in an online debate about whether the university should introduce a new set of exams. Unsurprisingly, many students were dead set against the idea. Crucially, they thought they were chatting to their peers, but their debating partners were really the experimenters themselves \u2013 who followed very rigid scripts that varied depending on whether the participant was in the experimental group or the control group.\nIn half of the conversations, the experimenters asked the students to elaborate on their views. For example, they might listen to a student's argument and respond: \"I was interested in what you're saying. Can you tell me more about how come you think that?\" For the other trials, the conversation did not include any request for more information on the participants' beliefs.\nIt was a tiny change in the script, but the addition of the single question changed the whole tone of the debate by provoking a considerably more open-minded response from the participants. They were more willing to continue the conversation and to receive further information on the other person's arguments, for instance.\nWe might be a little sceptical of the results from a single experiment, but Guy Itzchakov at the University of Haifa in Israel and his colleagues came to very similar conclusions in a series of studies involving hundreds of participants. Actively asking questions about people's beliefs and the reasons they hold those views leads them to lower their defences, so that they are considerably more receptive to alternative opinions.\u00a0\nAfter these kinds of conversations, participants were considerably more likely to agree with statements such as \"I feel that I ought to re-evaluate the event now, after the conversation\" \u2013 suggesting that they had become more thoughtful about the issues that they had discussed.\nWhile exchanging opinions, you shouldn't be afraid of sharing your first-hand experience of the issue at hand; indeed, it may just strengthen your argument.\nThis fact does not seem to be widely recognised. When Emily Kubin at the University of North Carolina and colleagues asked 251 participants to describe the best ways to present their opinion on an issue such as same-sex marriage or abortion, 56% chose the presentation of facts and evidence, while just 21% selected the expression of personal experience.\u00a0 \u00a0\nWe saw similar patterns within our Friendship Study. When we asked people to rate seven persuasion strategies, \"civility\" was number one, followed by \"logic and reason\". \"Personal experience\" came in at number five.\nKubin's experiments, however, suggest that it can be a potent tool of persuasion. Her team asked 177 participants to read about three people's opinions on topics like taxation, coal mining or gun control, before rating their respect for each person, and that person's rationality. No matter what their initial stance, the participants gave considerably higher ratings if they knew that the person had personal experience of the issue at hand.\nReading short texts online may seem a far cry from real-life encounters, but Kubin has also tested the principle in face-to-face dialogues on gun control, using a further sample of 153 local people who lived near the university. Once again, someone using a personal experience to portray their views commanded more respect from their conversation partner and was perceived to be more rational in their views.\nThere are, of course, good reasons to be wary of purely subjective accounts if they are not accompanied by any statistics, and an overreliance on an emotional appeal could raise the other person's suspicions. But the two approaches do not have to be mutually exclusive, and your point of view may be better received if you combine the two.\nConsider a recent examination of the 2018 midterm elections demonstrated. The study measured the progress of 230 canvassers, conversing on a range of political issues with 6,869 voters across seven US locations. Some were asked to make their case using purely statistical arguments \u2013 concerning, for instance, the common fear that immigration increases crime \u2013 while others were asked to exchange personal stories, in addition to presenting factual evidence.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Friendship in divided times: People don't want to argue with you as much as you think\n\u2022\u00a0Why do I feel so lonely even though I'm surrounded by people?\n\u2022\u00a0Seven ways to improve your sleep according to science\nEach of the voters took opinion polls before and after they met the canvassers. The researchers found that the mutually respectful exchange of experiences was more likely to shift opinion than conversations that focused more on impersonal facts and statistics.\nWhile the overall effects were small \u2013 resulting in a five-percentage-point shift in views on immigration, for example \u2013 this should be taken in context. On average, the conversations lasted just 11 minutes in total, yet a significant number of people started to change strongly held views.\u00a0\nThroughout your conversations, you should make sure that you maintain a basic level of civility \u2013 not only to your discussion partner, but also when you are talking about anyone else who may be involved in the debate, including public figures.\u00a0\nResearch by Jeremy Frimer at the University of Winnipeg and Linda Skitka at the University of Illinois at Chicago has shown that rude behaviour is far more likely to alienate the person you wish to persuade than change their opinion, and it may even disaffect people who were already coming around to your point of view. They describe this as the Montagu Principle, named after the 18th-Century English aristocrat Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who declared that \"civility costs nothing and buys everything\".\nBy demonstrating genuine curiosity, sharing your personal experiences, and maintaining a civil attitude, you may be surprised by your potential to connect \u2013 and gain a wiser worldview in the process.\n* David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

We tend to just nip in, go to the shops and wander around,\" Ruth says. \nLike Laura, they say they would contribute to conservation efforts. \n\"It's a fantastic idea because I think people feel obliged to donate anyway and we need it, so why not,\" Ruth adds.\n\"I'd absolutely tip the walls every time.\"\nDan Baxter and Aleksandra Baran are also among the wall explorers, enjoying a first and second time stroll along the medieval structure.\n\"I think a quid or two would be reasonable,\" Dan, who likes the idea of a donation point, says.\n\"Absolutely nothing is free and we want to conserve it.\"\nAs well as a card donation point, the council plans to add an interpretation board to showcase behind-the-scenes conservation work.\nBill Hill, from Friends of York Walls, says it is an \"under-appreciated service\". \n\"They've got all this work going on but the communication about what they're doing could be made much more interesting to the public,\" he says.\n\"The walls have from time to time fallen into disrepair. If they're not looked after they will fall down and parts of them have fallen down in the past. \n\"They are resting on clay and the clay settles. So if you don't attend to the settling and make sure the cracks are addressed, they will tumble down.\"\nHe believes donations from other attractions can raise between \u00a35,000 and \u00a350,000 a year depending on the footfall. \nA successful example is the Diocese of York, which raises 80% of its donations from such points.\n\"It's worth trying to see how it goes,\" Bill adds.\nOfficers at York City Council have recommended approving the proposal at a cost of \u00a35,000 and it will be discussed by councillors at a meeting on 25 March.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

I want to do my best,\" Arroyo told BBC Sport. \n\"I am finding it frustrating because I want the players to be brave and it's not the best moment for them to be brave. \n\"It's good to talk about that because I am just as scared as they are. I don't want to be the manager of a relegated team.\n\"But the reality is a possibility if we don't do our jobs. We are in the same boat so we need to row harder, faster and stronger to make it. I really believe we will make it.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nThis video can not be played\nClinton scores \"ingenious\" long-range strike as Man Utd beat Aston Villa\nThe mood was low, belief seemed to disappear and fans were fearing the worst on another painful evening in Birmingham on Sunday.\n\"If you love to win, stand up,\" was the chant being sung by Manchester United fans towards the end of their ruthless 4-0 win at Villa Park.\nAnd even some Villa fans joined in.\nTheir side had struggled to create chances in a timid first half and were punished. They never found a way back into the game.\n\"I've really struggled to understand what Aston Villa are trying to do. The players look lost,\" said former England midfielder Izzy Christiansen on Sky Sports. \n\"I feel for the players right now and I don't want to be too harsh because I don't know what the root of the problems are. \n\"They're in this situation for a reason - the table doesn't lie. The manager has got to find the right words very carefully to motivate the team and get them on track, because it could end up being a slippery slope for the football club.\"\nJust before the full-time whistle went, manager Arroyo was crouched down in the dugout, perhaps pondering what to say to her players.\nShe jumped up afterwards and went over to each of them, giving them hugs and consoling handshakes.\nIn her pre-match programme notes, Arroyo admitted the squad was \"struggling\" and last week's defeat by Palace had knocked them.\n\"We're not getting the results that we all expect and not performing the way that we want,\" she added.\nIt is a feeling that will have only worsened on Sunday and you could sense the anxiety around Villa Park.\n\"Villa might actually get relegated,\" one security guard outside the press room blurted out afterwards.\nUnited led 3-0 by half-time thanks to a double from striker Elisabeth Terland and a long-range lob by Grace Clinton.\nVilla's evening got worse when Leah Galton added a fourth goal, and though substitute Ebony Salmon provided a threat, it was too late to make a dent.\nArroyo's side have only five matches to secure their safety in the WSL.\nAston Villa have lost their last six WSL games\nHow Villa have fallen so quickly is not clear.\nThey were being touted as a team who could break into the top four just 18 months ago - but now there are several factors that appear to have contributed to their downfall.\nSince former manager Carla Ward's resignation last season, they have struggled to find consistency, appointing Robert de Pauw before sacking him after six months.\nThat caused disruption in the January transfer window and Villa allowed big-name players Kenza Dali and Adriana Leon - who had grown unhappy - to leave in the hope of improving things in the dressing room. \nRecruitment has not entirely paid off. They spent money on club record signing Gabi Nunes, for example, but have still struggled to score goals.\n\"It's really surprising to see the downward spiral they have been on,\" former England defender Laura Bassett told BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\"I don't think the performances and the way they are competing has been bad but there's been individual mistakes and a lack of belief. \n\"They have not been clinical and not scoring goals so that can manifest psychologically, making it tough. \n\"We haven't seen that [new manager] bounce and I know a lot of players are out of contract at the end of the season too. In terms of management higher up, I'd be asking 'what is the direction?'\"\nWhat was most evident on Sunday was a growing sense of anxiety among Villa supporters.\nBut Arroyo says they can help the team fight for survival and she hopes to give them \"what they deserve\" by delivering results in the next five games.\n\"If you are not winning I cannot ask them to support us happily. I think they are trying their best,\" she said. \n\"I can only say 'thank you for coming' because we are not even able to score so I cannot ask them for anything. The only thing I can say is that we will work as hard as possible. \n\"I am pleased they understand we are struggling because with their support we will be stronger. We are not in the position we want, we are not in the position the club wants and we are not in the position the fans deserve. \n\"This is the reality. I'm sorry. If they can make the next game, hopefully they can celebrate with us.\"\nDespite the struggles, Arroyo still has belief.\nShe added: \"I see the players are committed and trying to learn. I am convinced we will make it.\"",

I am sorry, it's my decision, and I accept that decision,\" said Crisafulli.\nThe government had toyed with plans to redevelop the Gabba - which was built in 1895 and has staged 67 men's Test matches - but those plans were scrapped following a 100-day review into planning for 2032.\nCricket, which is being held in Los Angeles in 2028 and is likely to be retained in 2032, could be played at the Gabba before the arena is torn down. \n\"Wouldn't it be amazing to see the Australian cricket team win gold at an Olympic final?

It hasn't been well maintained, and we do need a stadium to host this great show, and there is an opportunity for legacy play.\"\nQueensland Cricket backed the plans, with chief executive Terry Svenson saying the arena had been a \"wonderful venue\" but its challenges were \"well documented\". \nA new 25,000-seater national aquatic centre will be built in Spring Hill near the main stadium, while a new 20,000-seater arena is planned near the main athletes village. \nThe rowing will be held in Queensland's Fitzroy River, which is known to host saltwater crocodiles but the government says the waters are safe.\n\"If it's good enough for central Queensland kids, I reckon it's good enough for Pierre from Paris,\" said Crisafulli. \nThe Brisbane Queensland Tennis Centre will receive significant upgrades in order to host tennis events. \nThe Gabba first staged a Test match in 1931 \nSpeaking to BBC World Service, ABC reporter Arianna Levy said the plans to build a stadium in Victoria Park are controversial because the site holds \"cultural significance\" to aboriginal people. \n\"It really has come as a political backflip.\" said Levy on Tuesday.\n\"It's been really polarising for a lot of the community here in Queensland.\n\"The main stadium in Victoria Park, which will host 63,000 seats, it's one of the few green sites across Brisbane and it holds cultural significance to the indigenous people of Brisbane, the Turrbal people. They call the place the Barrambin. \n\"It was a native camping ground and food-gathering place. It had First Nations people from across Queensland gather all over the place for corroboree, which is the traditional dance for First Nations people. \n\"There were protests today.

Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website & app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra\nA missed flight and an absent manager on the eve of a World Cup qualifier.\nAs Wales take on North Macedonia on Tuesday as part of a campaign they hope will result in a trip to north America next summer, they return to the city made memorable for the time Chris Coleman forgot to check his luggage.\nIt is 12 years since Skopje was the setting for one of the more bizarre tales of Welsh football history, one that drew sniggers and sneers, not to mention damning headlines for their under-pressure manager.\nBut while it will be long remembered as the time the Wales manager lost his passport \u2013 before losing the game \u2013 it was also the night the team found their voice.\nAnd with it, discovered a path to qualification they still travel upon today.\n'Mr Calm' Bellamy looks to Skopje after opening win\nMatondo 'buzzing' after achieving Wales dream\nQuiz: How well do you know Bellamy's career?\n\"Good to see you Kit, but with the greatest respect, where's the manager?\"\nIt is September 2013 and Kit Symons had just taken his seat in front of the waiting media at the Tose Proeski Arena, the same venue Wales will play on Tuesday night.\nThe former Manchester City, Crystal Palace and Fulham defender had been part of the backroom staff since Coleman had accepted the unenviable task of replacing his close friend Gary Speed in the most trying of circumstances.\nThere was little more than 24 hours until Wales \u2013 including a soon-to-retire Craig Bellamy and Gareth Bale just weeks into his status as the world's most expensive player \u2013 were to face Macedonia at the tail-end of a failing campaign to reach the 2014 World Cup.\nThe inquisitor already knew the answer. As did most in the room.\n\"Skopje wasn't quite as developed as it is now, but it was a glorious day and we had walked along the river from the city to the stadium,\" recalls newspaper journalist Neil Moxley, who had covered Wales for several campaigns. \n\"As we walked, I can remember thinking what kind of questions we were going to ask Chris Coleman, who was a great guy to work with but hadn't had the easiest of rides.\n\"You had the Bale angle, but it was a bit of a dead-rubber of a game \u2013 and then the whispers had started. The manager had forgotten his passport and hadn't travelled.\"\nAs the team \u2013 Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Ben Davies and all \u2013 began to train on the uninviting pitch on the other side of the wall, Football Association of Wales (FAW) officials were simply saying Coleman was delayed by \"passport issues\".\n\"That's all I was told I could say,\" laughs Symons now, having had the uncomfortable job of trying to show all was normal. \n\"It was going to be resolved and he'd be there in plenty of time for the game \u2013 but I knew I was going to get battered.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWales boss Bellamy pleased with 'positive' Kazakhstan result\nColeman had realised his \"passport issue\" the previous night, but Symons only knew the former Fulham and Crystal Palace defender's dash to the nearby Newport passport office for an emergency replacement was in vain when he was not boarding the chartered flight in the morning.\nInstead, a convoluted alternative flight with stops via other European hubs awaited Coleman, as did the headlines.\nFor a football nation still smarting from some of the mockery of the years under Bobby Gould \u2013 with training ground wrestling and practice matches on prison grounds \u2013 the words embarrassing and farcical again found their way into the copy filed.\n\"We knew what was coming, but in reality all your work is done by that point,\" recalls Symons. \n\"The training the night before a game is by and large a stretch of the legs after travelling. \n\"You don't even go through set pieces or shape because you know some of the locals will be watching.\n\"It didn't really matter \u2013 but it didn't look good either.\"\nNot when Bale's presence alone - followed all week by Spanish photographers with his move to Madrid still fresh \u2013 put a global focus on matters.\nAnd certainly not for a manager still trying to win over critics and supporters.\nFAW chief executive Jonathan Ford had conceded defeat on trying to downplay things on the night, but later put it: \"We've all misplaced wallets or passports or whatever, it's just when you're in the position of national team manager you do it with a megaphone.\"\nAnd, even in the early days of social media, the unusual tale had long since found its way back home.\n\"Sometimes you write stories with a heavy heart because you like them as a person,\" adds Moxley. \n\"They try and say there's no new stories in football \u2013 but an international manager missing the night before a game because he'd lost his passport? This was definitely one.\"\n\"Do I have anything to say? No, but you have obviously. You write it. We are building a good little team here, but you won't write about that.\"\nChris Coleman was not so much defensive as on the attack as he faced up to questions over his blunder in the aftermath of a 2-1 defeat.\nHe had a point too; performances had been increasingly promising and there had been signs of a team and manager finding their feet together.\n\"That was the thing, we actually played well that night and deserved something from the game,\" recalls midfielder Joe Ledley. \n\"I remember the conditions being quite difficult; the pitch was really dry and bobbly, and they were really physical against us as a relatively young side.\n\"The manager not being there the night before didn't make any difference \u2013 we didn't even really notice until we were on the plane, and even then we had a bit of laugh about it.\n\"We lost and were gutted, but I remember feeling we still felt we were progressing and getting close to being where we wanted to be and taking the next step to achieving what we wanted.\n\"But it's Wales for you - nothing's ever straightforward.\"\nChris Coleman is currently in charge of Belgian top flight side OH Leuven\nA deflected free-kick had given the hosts the lead before Ramsey won and converted a penalty to equalise, only for Aleksandar Trajkovski to make the most of a late lapse of concentration.\nInjuries had hit the squad too. Bale's only involvement in the game was to fend off a couple of local autograph hunters who rushed onto the pitch at half-time. \nNot able to shake off a foot problem, he had been named on the bench by Coleman - but only to keep the opposition guessing, something that had confused supporters.\nThe result officially ended 2014 World Cup qualification hopes and \u2013 with a new contract still not agreed between the FAW and the manager \u2013 some wondered if it would be the end of his reign, well before the Euro 2016 success that was to come.\n\"We had been going along nicely, but I'd brought it upon myself and I was angry that I'd done that,\" said Coleman a few years later. \n\"I'd messed up but I just knew if they could stay with me, then we could be ready to take things on in the next campaign.\"\nBellamy \u2013 who would call time on his Wales playing days the following month \u2013 spoke glowingly of Ramsey's potential, as the playmaker showed he was back to his best form since his horrific leg break a few years earlier.\nBut it was what players said in private to officials and the media in the hours afterwards that was most significant.\nAfter the publication of the headlines which hit out at Coleman for the defeat and his passport gaffe, a number of senior players made their feelings known that \u2013 after some initial struggles together \u2013 they were fully on board with Coleman and his aims.\nThis video can not be played\nWorld Cup qualifying: Wales 3 - 1 Kazakhstan\nCaptain Ashley Williams was one of those who texted out his feelings to \"lay off the gaffer\", saying the players should not escape criticism but together they would get it right.\n\"We loved him [Coleman] and nights like that when he was under pressure, which we thought was unfair, made those bonds stronger,\" says Ledley, one of the players from that night who went on to reach the semi-finals of the Euros less than three years later.\n\"We knew we were onto something. It had been difficult for us and him after Gary, but we could see he was the right person.\"\nColeman was unaware of the texts of support that made their way to journalists that night but officials picked up on the fact senior players were now clearly behind the manager. A new contract was offered and signed.\n\"He had such a strong relationship with the players,\" said Symons.\n\"He knew he messed up and what people would think on the outside but inside he had their trust and those messages showed they wanted to protect him.\n\"People talk about Together Stronger for Wales, and that was it there.\n\"And because we all know what happened after, you can smile at it \u2013 and probably helped.\"\nNo laughing matter at the time, Coleman has since raised a smile at the events of Skopje that started with shambles but eventually led to a sense of where Wales were going under his charge.\n\"It didn't mean we didn't give him loads of stick about it,\" laughs Ledley.\nSymons adds that every subsequent away fixture would see scores of smiling team officials ask Coleman to check he knew where his passport was.\nAnd it does not diminish the tale's claim to be one of the more weird and wonderful in Welsh football.\n\"I've been privileged enough to cover some incredible moments and occasions following Wales,\" adds Moxley. \n\"But that trip to Skopje was the stand out story \u2013 especially when you know what happened next.\"",

        "article_text": "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.\nBut there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.\n\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Phillip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.\nIn exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.\nWe're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.\nWater and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.\nPhillip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.\nMore importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.\nSo cheap it made business sense for Phillip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.\nEach machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.\nOccasionally Phillip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.\nAt the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Phillip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.\n\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.\nZengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.\nIt was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.\nBritish-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.\nNow it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.\nAllowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.\n\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.\nThe bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.\nBitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.\nThe town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.\nOnly one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.\nAlthough the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses. \nSo, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.\n\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"\nHe's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.\n\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"\nEmbracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.\nElsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.\nLike many young people, they're glued to their phones.\n\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.\nThe little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.\n\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.\n\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.\n\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"\nNot many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.\nBut soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.\nZengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.\nSoon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.\nPhillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.\nThe company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.\nGridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.\nNorth of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.\nBut Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.\nThe company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.\nThey're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.\n\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.\nThe company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.\nFinding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.\nThe company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.\nBut the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.\nHistory tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.\n\nIn the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.\nAuthorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.\nFor example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.\nAgreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.\nThe environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.\nBut according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.\nSet ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.\nBut they are also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins.",

I am sorry, it's my decision, and I accept that decision,\" said Crisafulli.\nThe government had toyed with plans to redevelop the Gabba - which was built in 1895 and has staged 67 men's Test matches - but those plans were scrapped following a 100-day review into planning for 2032.\nCricket, which is being held in Los Angeles in 2028 and is likely to be retained in 2032, could be played at the Gabba before the arena is torn down. \n\"Wouldn't it be amazing to see the Australian cricket team win gold at an Olympic final? The Gabba's swansong,\" Crisafulli said. \n\"The Gabba is at its end of life. It hasn't been well maintained, and we do need a stadium to host this great show, and there is an opportunity for legacy play.\"\nQueensland Cricket backed the plans, with chief executive Terry Svenson saying the arena had been a \"wonderful venue\" but its challenges were \"well documented\". \nA new 25,000-seater national aquatic centre will be built in Spring Hill near the main stadium, while a new 20,000-seater arena is planned near the main athletes village. \nThe rowing will be held in Queensland's Fitzroy River, which is known to host saltwater crocodiles but the government says the waters are safe.\n\"If it's good enough for central Queensland kids, I reckon it's good enough for Pierre from Paris,\" said Crisafulli. \nFootball will be held in Cairns in the far north-east of Australia, while the Brisbane Queensland Tennis Centre will receive significant upgrades in order to host tennis events. \nThe Gabba first staged a Test match in 1931 ",

I am sorry, it's my decision, and I accept that decision,\" said Crisafulli.The government had toyed with plans to redevelop the Gabba - which was built in 1895 and has staged 67 men's Test matches - but those plans were scrapped following a 100-day review into planning for 2032.Cricket, which is being held in Los Angeles in 2028 and is likely to be retained in 2032, could be played at the Gabba before the arena is torn down. The decision, announced by Queensland Premier David Crisafulli, comes following numerous pledges before the 2024 state elections that a new stadium would not be built. The Gabba's swansong,\" Crisafulli said.",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister and Liberal leader Mark Carney has called an election in Canada, kickstarting five weeks of campaigning before Canadians head to the polls.\nVoting day will officially be on Monday 28 April.\nIt will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the two major parties in Canada - the Conservatives and the Liberals - are neck-and-neck in the polls, making it a race to watch.\nWhile Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.\nHere is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major parties.\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few days.\nHis party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.\nFor many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.\nHe was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. \nCarney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.\nBut Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. His French is also weak, which could be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec. \nRecent polls show his party is slightly trailing behind the Conservatives, but more Canadians say they think Carney would be a better prime minister than his opponent Pierre Poilievre.\nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.\nSince then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.\nHe is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government.\nIt is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.\nBut the Liberal Party has since caught up to him in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader.\nPoilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".\nPoilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first.\"\nTrump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.\nStill, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.\nBlanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, calling Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nHe has also dismissed Trump's tariffs, saying: \"I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.\"\nOn domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs.\nBlanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.\nPolling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.\nIn 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.\nThe NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\nBut in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.\nAt the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\nBut his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls show that only 9% of Canadians intend to vote for them as of mid-March, with their ground shrinking while support for the Liberals has risen.\nA big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. \nIn the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.\nAs Canada gears up for an election this year, the BBC wants to hear from voters across the country.

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The director of acclaimed period drama Wolf Hall says filming of last year's second series was nearly called off weeks before it was due to begin because of budget pressures.\nPeter Kosminsky told BBC Two's Newsnight they eventually opted to axe costly exterior scenes in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, meaning almost everything in the Tudor drama, screened by the BBC, became \"conversations in rooms\" instead.\nHe argues public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV can no longer afford to make high-end British drama.\nThe Bafta and Golden Globe-winning director is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.\nKosminsky told the BBC that six weeks before shooting began, having already cut certain props, locations, costumes and cast members, he and the producer decided the gap was still \"too great\" to go ahead with making The Mirror and The Light.\n\"That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\"\nKosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell,  executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.\nHe said the original script \"had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything\".\nHe said he was still \"incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all\".\nBut the original concept was a programme with \"more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms\".\nKosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.\nNow, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.\nOne day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are \"gone\".\nKosminsky also believes there is \"no way\" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.\nAdolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.\n\"It would have been a slightly different version of it,\" Thorne told the BBC.\n\"In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras.

Not interested.\" He cackles loudly again.\nClarke has been too rebellious a figure to be considered for poet laureate and its sherry-based salary, and at the age of 76 he argues he still has time to disqualify himself from being a fully paid-up national treasure.\n\"I could yet blot my copy book. I'm that foul-mouthed [person] that you've come to dredge up some grudging affection for, but I may yet do the wrong thing.\"\nFor someone who has always gone against the grain, and occasionally off the rails, it is hard to imagine what he could do now to diminish his status, however.\nOne honour the Salford-born wordsmith has agreed to accept is the 2025 Northern Music Award, which he will receive at a ceremony in Liverpool on Thursday.\nAlthough not strictly a musician, Clarke is closely associated with the music scene - from punk to the Arctic Monkeys, who turned his 1982 poem I Wanna Be Yours into a song that was the closing track on their 2013 album AM. \nIt was never officially released as a single but has since gone on to be streamed nearly three billion times by music fans and ranks among Spotify's all-time Top 40. \nMany of Clarke's poems were originally released with musical backings masterminded by producer Martin Hannett, who was known for his work with Joy Division.\nClarke has mixed feelings about the results.\n\"It was never my idea to put my poetry to music but I couldn't think of an argument against it,\" he says.\n\"So it was a new adventure for me, but I think the results were patchy. When it was good, it was great. But I'm hyper-critical of my own stuff.\n\"It wasn't my idea, that's all I'm saying, but I'm glad I did it now. It's put me in line for this award, for a start.\"\nTwo days after that ceremony, Clarke will achieve another landmark moment when he headlines Manchester's Co-op Live arena, albeit with a scaled-back set-up compared with its full 23,500 capacity.\nHas he ever performed in an arena? \"I've done outdoor shows that I suppose qualify as an arena,\" he says. \"But I've never done an arena with a lid on it like this one before.\"\nIt will be a far cry from the cabaret clubs where he started out in the city in the 60s, and the punk nights where he made his name in the 70s, after winning over hostile fans who initially aimed spit and bottles in his direction.\nSo what's more intimidating - playing to a small room of punks, or an arena with thousands of people?\n\"The more the merrier,\" he replies. \"If you're selling tickets for a living, the more the merrier.\"\nHe performed live with Joy Division, the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, The Fall and Elvis Costello, achieving cult status with social-realist poems like Beasley Street and Evidently Chickentown, the antisocial I Don't Wanna Be Nice, and the more surrealist (I Married A) Monster From Outer Space and Valley of the Lost Women.\nHowever, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.\n\"Well, I died four times. I came back but medical action was called for. I'm the luckiest guy alive. Somebody up there likes me.\"\nClarke eventually got clean after meeting his wife Evie, and his professional revival really began when Evidently Chickentown was used over the end credits of an episode in the final season of The Sopranos in 2007.\nFellow poets, comedians and musicians lined up to hail his influence in a 2012 BBC documentary, with Steve Coogan speaking about his \"spirit of dissent\", and Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner, calling him \"my hero\".\nTurner turned him into Britain's most listened-to poet by using his words in the Arctic Monkeys' 2013 song I Wanna Be Yours.\nThe original I Wanna Be Yours is a rare example in Clarke's catalogue of an unabashed love poem, albeit an unconventional one. \"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust,\" it begins.\nClarke originally released the poem on record with a kitsch musical backing in 1982.\n\"It should have been done like Alex does it from the start,\" he says. \"I mean, that is the definitive version. I love it.\"\nThe Arctics' version continues to strike a chord with a new generation and last year it had more streams around the world than any other track over a decade old.\nMeanwhile, the poem has also become a popular choice as a wedding reading.\n\"I'd be a billionaire if I had a quid for every person that recited that poem at their wedding,\" Clarke remarks.\nHe may not have that income stream, but he will have got a fraction of a penny for each of the song's three billion streams.\n\"It adds up, and then there's the PRS [royalties],\" he says.\n\"So I'm not complaining. For a change.\" He lets out another loud cackle.\nJohn Cooper Clarke plays Manchester's Co-op Live arena on Saturday, 29 March.",

Ford snapped an inch-perfect cross-kick for Joe Carpenter to score out wide after putting Tom O'Flaherty in with blurringly quick hands.\nAfterwards, Sale boss Alex Sanderson was talking up Ford's potentially last shot at British and Irish Lions selection.\n\"If George plays like that in the next seven games, it would be very hard not to pick him,\" said Sanderson.\n\"You learn best from your peers and particularly in a Lions squad where you've got to bring people together, George is a brilliant character at doing that.\n\"He helps me out all the time with that. There are loads of factors that lead into him being a good option for the Lions.\"\nDoing it against Newcastle and Wales \u2013 both bottom of their tables \u2013 is one thing. \nHowever, if Ford can produce similar magic away to Toulouse in the Champions Cup on 6 April, then Lions coach Andy Farrell, who has known Ford since he was a boy, will find his case even harder to resist.\nPlayer of the match Benson also made 51 metres with ball in hand after coming on early in the second half\n4,739 days.\nHarlequins' wait for an away win over London rivals Saracens has been a long one, going back to March 2012 and a showpiece game under the Wembley arch.\nIn the shining surrounds of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, it seemed like Quins' losing streak at the neighbours might stretch even longer.\nSaracens, who included England captains past and present Maro Itoje and Jamie George, among a host of internationals in their line-up, led 12-0 at half-time.\nBut unheralded 22-year-old fly-half Jamie Benson, making only his fourth Premiership appearance, stole the show by the end, steering Quins home via five out of five successful kicks off the tee.\nHaving played for England Under-20s alongside Quins team-mates Fin Baxter and Chandler Cunningham-South, Benson's progress has been slowed by his completing a Natural Sciences degree at Cambridge University.\nDuring his time as a student he has also played in three Varsity Matches, a fixture which in its 1980s heyday featured future internationals Rob Andrew and Stuart Barnes facing off at fly-half.\nCould Benson revive that tradition?\nMeanwhile, Saracens are in danger of breaking their own tradition.\nYou have to go back 16 seasons to find one, unaffected by their 2020 points deduction and subsequent relegation, in which they have failed to make the Premiership play-offs.\nCurrently seventh, they play Leicester, Gloucester and Sale, all above them in the table, in their next three matches.\nBath made fewer metres, fewer line breaks and beat less defenders with ball in hand, but still managed to subdue local rivals Gloucester\n\"We'll just have to do it next year now.\"\nAt the end of last year's Premiership final, Finn Russell made a vow to head coach Johann van Graan that Bath would return and go one better than their defeat by Northampton.\nThey certainly are going the right way about it.\nEleven points clear of third, they surged on towards a home semi-final with a 42-26 win over Gloucester, in which flanker Guy Pepper was superb.\nIt wasn't as comfortable as that scoreline might suggest.

The wing had produced an extraordinary charge-down of Santi Carreras' first-half conversion, flying off the line to block from bang in front.\nIt was an act that summed up the hunger of a team that has won eight of their past nine matches.\nJack Bates, who scored three of Bristol's eight tries against Exeter, joined the club as a 14-year-old\nEngland coach Steve Borthwick has said that the Premiership's stand-and-deliver slugfests are not ideal preparation for tighter Test rugby.\nHe could probably ignore much of Bristol's 52-38 win over Exeter. It was hard for anyone else to take their eyes off it though.\nThe first 18 minutes alone featured seven tries.\nBristol conceding a score before centre Benhard Janse van Rensburg caught Harry Byrne's restart and cantered straight in at the other end summed up a madcap opening.\nThe impressive Josh Hodge showed deft footwork to control the ball on the bounce before scorching in for the visitors.\nFeaturing 64 points, it was the highest-scoring first half in Premiership history.

        "article_text": "England head coach Thomas Tuchel shows his frustration during the World Cup qualifier against Latvia at Wembley\nThomas Tuchel wants England's brave new era to bring thrills and excitement, but he has swiftly discovered that if you have seen one England qualifier you have almost seen them all.\nTuchel has been firing off positive messages since delivering a damning verdict on England's Euro 2024 campaign under predecessor Gareth Southgate, which he claimed lacked intensity, identity and hunger.\nDuring the routine 3-0 win over a Latvia side ranked 140th in the world, it was clear Tuchel's intended transformation will not be a quick fix - because this was more of the same labouring old England seen so often under Southgate.\nThe Three Lions, as they have done so many times before, finally overcame gallant but limited opposition after struggling for long periods to make the most of their superiority, too often pedestrian and too often failing to transform good positions into goals.\nThere was the traditional Wembley backdrop of paper aeroplanes - with the first hitting the turf after 14 minutes as opposed to 33 against Albania - the Mexican wave and the thousands of empty seats well before the final whistle.\nAnd there were even the old frustrations that have surfaced before in this type of attritional fixture, with Jude Bellingham - who was already on a yellow card - fortunate referee Orel Grinfeld took a lenient view of his reckless second-half challenge on Raivis Jurkovskis.\nEngland got there in the end, as they always do in these qualifiers, with Reece James illuminating his first international start since September 2022 with a superb free-kick seven minutes from half-time to break the deadlock.\nLatvia, unsurprisingly, barely left their half after the break, and England put the result beyond doubt with two goals in eight minutes.\nCaptain Harry Kane scored his 71st goal in 105 international appearances with a simple tap-in after 68 minutes and substitute Eberechi Eze added the hosts' third with a deflected shot.\nAll very routine. All very England when it comes to qualifiers - as it should be against a country ranked between Burundi and the Dominican Republic on Fifa's list.\nEze scores first England goal as Three Lions beat Latvia \nWho can be 'a real asset'?

He wants more touches in the opposition box - and that figure more than doubled from his first game against Albania, increasing from 34 on Friday to 69 against Latvia.\nThey put in 36 crosses on a night when they enjoyed 73.5% possession, but the end product was poor. Marcus Rashford improved slightly on his performance against Albania, but Jarrod Bowen could not make the desired impact as a replacement for struggling Phil Foden.\nEngland sent in 21 of those crosses in the first half, the most in a game since they played Poland in October 2013 and delivered 25 - but their only goal game from James' free-kick.\nIn a sign of England's complete domination, they had 569 successful passes in Latvia's half compared to the visitors' 26 in theirs, and must be disappointed such overwhelming statistics resulted in relatively meagre results.\nTuchel wants to give England a fresh identity as they try to cross the psychological barrier from a nearly team to winners, but - as so often in the past - the acid test will only truly come when (it is hardly if) they qualify for the 2026 World Cup.\nQualifying should be a formality from a group that also contains Andorra and Serbia, so the first high-quality opponents England are likely to meet will be when they get to the World Cup. \nIt is a situation they have been in before - and then been found wanting when it matters.\nWho makes your England World Cup starting XI?\n'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?\nJude Bellingham was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card for a reckless challenge on Raivis Jurkovskis\nThis a problem for Tuchel to solve and one he will be well aware of.\nBut the 51-year-old will have enjoyed the spectacular strike from James, a player he greatly admires and who was a vital part of his Chelsea team that won the Champions League in 2021.\nKane's second was also right up the head coach's street, with Declan Rice accelerating into the Latvia area, collecting Morgan Rogers' pass and drilling a ball across the face of the six-yard box which left his captain with a simple finish.\nWhat will cheer Tuchel is that he has plenty of raw materials to work with.\nBellingham, for all the impetuosity that could - and should - have seen him sent off on Monday, is a generational talent, while Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has demonstrated he is a natural at this level.\nThere was more good news from The Hawthorns where another Gunner, Ethan Nwaneri, excelled in a goalscoring performance for England Under-21s - and the return of a third Arsenal player, Bukayo Saka, will offer an added attacking dimension.\nTuchel's task is to find the \"X Factor\", the missing ingredient, to get England's men over the line they have failed to cross since the 1966 World Cup.\nTwo wins from two games is a satisfactory - and totally expected - opening to the Tuchel era, but now he must discover the missing link to enable him to deliver the exciting England side he has promised.\nAnd on the somewhat tedious evidence of his first two games, Tuchel will have plenty to exercise his mind between now and the next international camp in June.",

        "summary": "'England show Tuchel's search for thrills will be no quick fix'Image source, ReutersImage caption, England head coach Thomas Tuchel shows his frustration during the World Cup qualifier against Latvia at WembleyPhil McNultyChief football writer at WembleyPublished1 hour ago159 CommentsThomas Tuchel wants England's brave new era to bring thrills and excitement, but he has swiftly discovered that if you have seen one England qualifier you have almost seen them all.Tuchel has been firing off positive messages since delivering a damning verdict on England's Euro 2024 campaign under predecessor Gareth Southgate, which he claimed lacked intensity, identity and hunger.During the routine 3-0 win over a Latvia side ranked 140th in the world, it was clear Tuchel's intended transformation will not be a quick fix - because this was more of the same labouring old England seen so often under Southgate.The Three Lions, as they have done so many times before, finally overcame gallant but limited opposition after struggling for long periods to make the most of their superiority, too often pedestrian and too often failing to transform good positions into goals.There was the traditional Wembley backdrop of paper aeroplanes - with the first hitting the turf after 14 minutes as opposed to 33 against Albania - the Mexican wave and the thousands of empty seats well before the final whistle.And there were even the old frustrations that have surfaced before in this type of attritional fixture, with Jude Bellingham - who was already on a yellow card - fortunate referee Orel Grinfeld took a lenient view of his reckless second-half challenge on Raivis Jurkovskis.England got there in the end, as they always do in these qualifiers, with Reece James illuminating his first international start since September 2022 with a superb free-kick seven minutes from half-time to break the deadlock.Latvia, unsurprisingly, barely left their half after the break, and England put the result beyond doubt with two goals in eight minutes.Captain Harry Kane scored his 71st goal in 105 international appearances with a simple tap-in after 68 minutes and substitute Eberechi Eze added the hosts' third with a deflected shot.All very routine.
