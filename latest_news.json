        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has rescinded an executive order targeting a prestigious international law firm after it promised to abandon diversity policies and provide $40m (\u00a331m) worth of free legal work to support White House initiatives. \nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is a multinational law firm headquartered in New York that has many high-profile clients. \nTrump's 14 March order had terminated federal contracts with the firm and suspended security clearances for its lawyers, saying it was undermining the US judicial system.\nThe firm is now facing blowback from many in the legal community, including a top lawyer for Democrats, even as some lawyers said it had few other options.\nTrump has issued similar executive orders against the law firms Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling. \nThe White House rescinded the order on Thursday after a meeting between Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton. \nIn a post on Truth Social, the president said the firm had agreed to a series of concessions, including the promise to provide \"the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump's term to support the Administration's initiatives\".\nIt added that Paul Weiss would commit to \"merit-based\" hiring and promotion, and \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies\".\nTrump's order last week had cancelled contracts with the firms citing Trump's orders to wipe out any initiatives aimed at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) within the federal government.\nThe Truth Social post also included a statement from Mr Karp, who said: \"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.\"\nMany in the legal community have expressed outrage over the deal, which one lawyer said was a \"sad day for the legal industry\".\nMarc Elias, a former Perkins Coie partner and a top lawyer for Democrats, assailed the agreement in a post on social media platform Bluesky.\n\"Paul Weiss, didn't just bend a knee, it set a new standard for shameful capitulation,\" he wrote. \"This is a stain on the firm, every one of its partners, and the entire legal profession.\"\nSoon after Trump made the announcement, Rachel Cohen, an associate at the Skadden Arps legal firm, resigned in a blistering company-wide email condemning the agreement.\n\"Please consider this email my two week notice, revocable if the firm comes up with a satisfactory response to the current moment,\" she wrote. Cohen had asked Skadden to sign onto a brief supporting another firm that has sued the Trump administration.\nShe had helped organise the open letter criticising the Trump administration for attempting to \"bully corporate law firms out of engaging in any representation that challenges the administration's aims\". More than 300 associates have signed the letter, using the name of their firm and class year, since it went live about a week ago, Politico reported.\nIn an internal email to its lawyers, Mr Karp defended the agreement, saying it was in line with the firm's principles, including a commitment to remaining politically independent, Reuters reported.\nThe firm brought in more than $2bn in annual revenues in 2023, and employed more than 1,000 attorneys, according to American Lawyer Magazine. Revoking its security clearance, which allows its lawyers to see some sensitive information, could have created hurdles to its work with its many corporate, security and Wall Street clients.\nIn the original executive order, Trump had accused the firm of playing \"an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles\".\nIt had cited \"a Paul Weiss partner\" who had filed a pro bono lawsuit against the perpetrators of the 6 January 2021 riots at the Capitol. Trump has released all and pardoned many of those known as \"J6ers\".\nIt also took direct aim at Mark Pomerantz - a former partner who had worked with the Manhattan District Attorney  on the case involving hush-money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was convicted by a jury last year of  having committed a felony in the case.\nThe order had also alleged that the firm \"discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws\".

How England's players rated\n'He does everything right' - the remarkable rise of Lewis-Skelly\nThis average positions graphic shows how high England played against a defensive opponent (England are black and Albania are purple)\nBefore the game Tuchel created plenty of headlines when he said England looked like they had played with fear at Euro 2024 under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.\nHe also suggested he wanted them to play Premier League-style physical football.\nKnown for his tactical flexibility, nobody was quite certain what formation Tuchel would opt for - but he sent England out in a 4-2-3-1.\nWhile Tuchel's teams are normally known for their intensity and pressing, it was hard for England to show either against a team who set up as defensively as Albania, especially in the first half.\nAnd the German is also still in the early stages of his reign - having only met his players four days ago for the first time since officially taking over in January.\n\"Thomas Tuchel's had the squad for three days - you can't expect to see a different England team,\" said former Three Lions midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"We won the football match. Once we got ahead there was no urgency. \n\"We want to be entertained. There is a certain element of control which is good in tournament football.\n\"At the minute we're not in a tournament, we want to be entertained.\"\nEngland had 74% of the ball and 12 shots to Albania's three - with the hosts recording all six efforts on target in the game.\nIn the opening 45 minutes they completed 437 passes, the most on Opta's records of any England first half.\nThe visitors did try to play more after the break, but England's backline were only tested a few times by substitute Armando Broja. \nThe result itself was routine - new England manager or not. The Three Lions are unbeaten in 38 home qualifiers for World Cups or Euros since November 2007, with 34 wins. \n\"It was a difficult game from a spectating perspective,\" said former England defender Matt Upson on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Once we got into the rhythm, it was very much an England game at Wembley against inferior opposition where they struggled to break them down.\n\"We are all wanting to see how Thomas Tuchel's plan is going to happen.\n\"There are so many questions, but ultimately they have to manage the game itself and England did that well.\"\nUpson added that Tuchel probably learned to \"understand what it feels like and looks like tactically\" to play against a team in a low block like Albania's.\nJust a few months ago, Arsenal left-back Lewis-Skelly, 18, would barely have been on England's radar. He had not played a senior professional game until after the September international break.\nBut he has broken into Arsenal's first team, scored against Manchester City and been sent off twice (although one was overturned) in 26 games - and now firmly established himself as a Gunners regular.\n\"It doesn't get much better,\" said former Arsenal centre-back Upson.\n\"The opportunity has fallen to him, the timing has been great. The amount of injuries Arsenal had got him in the team.\n\"Those doors have opened, but he has had to grab those opportunities. He looks to be a top player.\"\nTuchel gave him a chance for England and he took it with both hands.\nIn a prime example of the modern full-back role, Lewis-Skelly was front-footed, cutting into central midfield and popping up in the box.\nAnd he got the opening goal when he appeared in the Albania area to score through Thomas Strakosha's legs from Jude Bellingham's fantastic through ball.\nThat made him the third-youngest England goalscorer ever - and youngest to net on his debut.\nMyles Lewis-Skelly had more touches in Albania's half than his own\n\"In the second half he played as a number eight or a number 10,\" said Tuchel. \n\"His very best position is where he plays for Arsenal in the double six. \n\"We tried to play a bit more conventional today as it's easier to learn because we have many players from many different clubs, but he understands very quickly.\"\nLewis-Skelly left the pitch to an ovation in the final minute.\nEngland tried three different left-backs in their final three Nations League games - Lewis Hall, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Rico Lewis - but Lewis-Skelly will hope to make the position his own.\nUpson said: \"He was absolutely superb. To manage and handle that occasion in the manner he did with the very limited senior football he has had... really speaks volumes about how good a player he is and how far he can go. It was a brilliant evening for him.\n\"When you look at the competition for that position, Lewis Hall is probably the closest. You can see a little battle between the two of them for the left-back slot. That was a big moment for Lewis-Skelly tonight to try to cement himself in Thomas Tuchel's mind for that role.\"\nEx-Everton player Osman added: \"He was dead relaxed, but he wasn't tested defensively.\n\"To secure the position he will have to show he can stand up defensively.\"\nDan Burn went close to his second Wembley headed goal in a week\nCentre-back Burn is at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to England debuts.\nThis was the 32-year-old's first appearance for England at any age level. In fact he was the oldest Three Lions debutant since Kevin Davies in 2010.\nIt came in what is undoubtedly the best week of the 6ft 7in defender's career.\nOn Sunday, also at Wembley, he headed his boyhood club Newcastle ahead against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final as they won 2-1 to lift a first trophy in 56 years.\nThe following day he joined up with England.\nHe was given an immediate debut by Tuchel - and did well.\nBurn became the first England debutant to make 100 or more passes on Opta's record - and ended up completing 135 from 137.\nHe made more clearances (seven), won more tackles (two) and won more aerial duels (four) than any other Three Lions player.\nPlus he managed to hit both crossbars, turning a clearance against his own woodwork before later heading Declan Rice's corner on to the bar.\nUpson said: \"He was excellent in the first half, looked very good but didn't have much to deal with defensively. He showed his threat from set-pieces.\"\nHowever, there were a few moments where he was caught out, especially when Broja came on.\nMarc Guehi, who was one of England's best players at Euro 2024, watched on from the bench with Ezri Konsa starting alongside Burn.\n\"There were a couple of moments in the second half where Burn got hurt in behind, got a bit tight and spun,\" said Upson. \"His partnership with Konsa was excellent.\n\"Konsa's performance was very assured and showed he's really developed in the last six months. Playing in the Champions League with Aston Villa has brought him on to the next level. \n\"Burn has moments of impact but I thought Konsa is probably best placed to keep his spot.\"\nRejection, non-league and pushing trolleys: Burn's rise to England\n'I don't want to go to sleep because I feel like I'm dreaming'\nEngland wingers Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford both failed to set the game alight.\nManchester United forward Rashford, on loan at Villa, was given his first England chance in a year after rediscovering his form under Unai Emery.\nHe showed a few good touches, especially early on, but failed to create much.\nManchester City's Foden had a similar experience on the right-hand side. \nThey were both replaced, along with Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones, in the 74th minute.\n\"Both of our wingers that started were not as impactful as they can be or as they are in club football,\" said Tuchel.\n\"At the moment I'm not so sure why we struggled to bring the ball quicker to them.\n\"They trained very well, they were decisive in training which is why they deserved it. They were very good in the last weeks in their clubs. \n\"We will keep encouraging them and give them a structure so they can show their potential.\"\nUpson said: \"Foden wants to come inside. He's not the type of out-and-out winger which Tuchel wants to play.\n\"He wants a fast-paced aggressive style - to go at teams. Foden is more of a footballer who likes to come to feet and open things up that way. \n\"Rashford showed willingness and he has that speed but didn't quite find the end product tonight. \n\"He was looking not to lose the ball instead of taking a risk. It's an area that will be tinkered with in games to come.\"\nHarry Kane is now 17 goals clear of Wayne Rooney's previous England goalscoring record\nCaptain Kane is England's all-time leading scorer by some way - and he netted his 70th international goal on Friday.\nIt came after a fine bit of control to take down Rice's cross before he passed the ball into the bottom corner.\nKane is the first England player to score on his first appearance under three different managers - Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate and Tuchel.\n\"Typical Kane,\" said Upson. \"He didn't get much action for quite long periods but a couple of his passes were superb. He drops deeps and clips those balls over the top. \n\"His finish was really high level. The first touch and movement and to find that bottom corner was excellent. Very much a Kane-type performance. \n\"He would probably want to be involved in the game a bit more in the build-up. But Albania sat in so didn't allow him a lot of opportunities to get the ball.\"\nThe 31-year-old continued his fine association with Tuchel too, having bagged 44 goals in 45 games under the German at Bayern Munich.\nMauricio Pochettino is now the only manager Kane has scored more goals under.",

        "article_text": "Back pain is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, but an AI-powered app is being used to help patients in the UK to manage their symptoms. But how does it measure up?\nWhen I hurt my back in October 2024, the cause wasn't immediately clear. Perhaps, something went awry while hoisting one of my young nephews in the air. Or, more likely, I messed my back up while lifting a bed so my wife could slide a rug underneath.\nWhatever the trigger, my overconfidence in my own strength left me with a lower back injury. Days later, the pain began radiating down the sciatic nerve in my left leg. Standing was fine, sitting was torture. In order to sleep, I had to slide a pillow underneath my legs to keep the downward-pulsing shockwaves at bay.\nBy mid-December, I saw a pain medicine specialist in the area of Washington, DC where I live. He ran some movement tests, sent me for X-rays, and wrote me a referral for physical therapy with a diagnosis of \"lumbar radiculopathy\". In the United States, this is a relatively quick process \u2013 I went from pain to starting treatment in about three months. But that's still a very long time for something so common \u2013 and debilitating \u2013 as lower back pain.\nSince early January, I have seen human physical therapists who work wonders. Once a week, I go in, discuss my pain, get a soft-tissue massage, and do well-supervised exercises and stretches. My pain isn't gone, but it's finally under control.\nI specified that these physical therapists are human because, well, I've also been seeing a new physio in the UK. But my new British physio is only partly human. Rather, she's a series of pre-recorded videos made by a real physiotherapist, powered by artificial intelligence that I can access via an app on my phone.\nThe service, provided by a company called Flok Health, is the first artificial intelligence clinic \u2013 of any kind \u2013 to be trialled by the UK's National Health Service (NHS). It's been approved for use by the country\u2019s Care Quality Commission as a registered healthcare provider, and began seeing patients \u2013 just like me \u2013 at the end of 2024.\nThe reason: a lot of people suffer from lower back pain and struggle to get access to the care they need. As of September 2024, nearly 350,000 people in England alone were on waiting lists for treatment for musculoskeletal problems \u2013 the longest of all waitlists for any set of conditions. The UK government reported that 23.4 million work days were lost in 2022 alone due to these untreated problems, implying an enormous economic as well as human cost. Globally, lower back pain is a leading cause of disability and affects an estimated 223 million people worldwide.\u00a0\nFlok's promise is to start seeing patients immediately, relieve the burden on the NHS, and head off patients' back pain before they go untreated and deteriorate. It's a noble mission, but I had one question: Was AI really the answer?\nIn addition to being a trained doctor, Finn Stevenson spent time as a professional rower in Great Britain's Olympic development programme. Anyone who has rowed before \u2013 or even spent time on a rowing machine at a gym \u2013 knows that the sport can be an incredible workout but also brutal on the back if your form isn't perfect. While a professional athlete, Stevenson had access to top doctors and physiotherapists who could treat his ailments immediately. But when he left rowing and his back pain flared up, he realised what it's like for everyone else trying to receive care.\n\"It was quite a big shock in terms of what access to care looked like for 99.5% of people,\" says Stevenson, now Flok's chief executive. \"In theory, I should be pretty well placed to manage this. I had an academic background, I'd had three years of professional physio. If I was struggling, other people probably were too.\"\nStevenson and Ric da Silva, now his co-founder and Flok's chief technology officer, met when they were early employees at a company called CMR Surgical, a British startup where the pair worked on building robotics for soft-tissue surgery.\u00a0\nBut with Flok, they are aiming to provide treatment to people who don't need surgery. They are looking to help people with the easiest and most manageable cases.\u00a0\n\"There are quite a few conditions where that's true, where you don't need a scan, you don't need hands-on manipulation, you don't need medication,\" says da Silva. \"What you need is 10 minutes of stretches a few times a week, and that will solve the problem.\"\nThe idea is that this should then free up clinicians to focus on the patients with more complex problems who really need their help.\nWhen I first open Flok, I'm greeted by Kirsty, my physiotherapist. She appears in a minimalist setting with all of the accoutrements befitting a yoga instructor: black workout outfit, bamboo-coloured exercise mat, contemporary office chair, and a Monstera plant. She asks me questions about myself and my pain, and I respond by clicking multiple-choice options. Each response triggers a follow-up question or instruction as the underlying AI adapts to my answers.\nBut rather than being a live video call, this interaction is a series of pre-recorded video that are stitched together by AI based on my answers.\u00a0\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom of the past few years has been spurred by advances in generative AI from large language models, Flok has a different use for AI. \"We essentially developed a domain specific language for describing clinical reasoning,\" says Stevenson. Because it's not a ChatGPT-like chatbot predicting the next word in a sequence, there isn't a risk of the so-called hallucination problem in AI where an algorithm makes things up \u2013 a major concern about AI in the medical field.\nInstead, this AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion \"intervention combinations\", says Stevenson. The power of AI makes it possible to deliver this in a seamless way.\nIt's a \"perfect software problem\", says Stevenson. \"Software is an extremely good delivery model if you know what you're trying to deliver, and if you just need to do that in a more scalable way.\"\nFlok is currently expanding its operations. Its service launched first in Scotland at the end of last year and has recently signed contracts to add locations in England, though Stevenson isn't yet able to reveal where. In the next 12 months, Stevenson said he hopes to cover at least half of the UK. And they're also expanding what pain areas they're treating hip and knee osteoarthritis and women's pelvic health.\u00a0\nBut it is also not alone in trying to use AI to tackle musculoskeletal pain. Another AI-based app that helps patients manage pain in the lower back and neck called selfBACK has been undergoing clinical trials in the US as an add-on to more typical care services.\nNot entirely unlike Flok's approach, selfBACK works by analysing what treatments worked well for previous patients with similar conditions, then recommending personalised exercise plans. Studies have indicated that it can help to reduce pain among those who use it. But a recent trial found slow adoption rates \u2013 nearly one-third of trial participants never used the app, and another third only used it a few times. Patients and practitioners concluded that the app should be used to supplement traditional care rather than replace it. Other studies have also cautioned that self-management apps need to be provided in addition to care not as a replacement.\nEven so, research seems to suggest that mobile health apps of this nature are a potentially promising approach to helping patients manage their back pain. But there are also no shortage of questions about AI's integration into healthcare more broadly. Elizabeth A. Stuart, a professor and chair of the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that AI healthcare tools should undergo the same rigorous evaluations as traditional medical interventions, such as regulatory approvals and peer review.\n\"In some ways, these AI tools are no different from other healthcare interventions that we want to learn about the effects of,\" says Stuart. \"We need to assess how well they work, do they work, who do they work for, just as carefully as we have done for other healthcare interventions.\"\u00a0\nStuart says that while we don't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to AI, we do need to recognise when these systems keep evolving even after they're deployed. \"With some AI tools, they are sort of self-adapting,\" she says.\nShe contrasts AI tools with the annual flu vaccines, which undergo deliberate assessment processes each year to ensure they're targeted to the latest viral strain. But sometimes AI tools are a black box, \"changing under the hood\" in real-time and it's not always clear how, she says.\u00a0\nPranav Rajpurkar, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, says he sees promise in AI applications that help triage care for patients. \"What's counterintuitive is that forced collaboration between AI and clinicians often underperforms compared to a clear division of labor,\" he says. \"When doctors and AI review the same cases side-by-side, their combined accuracy is sometimes barely better than doctors alone. Clean separation of responsibilities side steps these issues.\"\nIn Flok's case, the company employs professional physios who appear in the videos that patients see, but are available to answer patient questions after their AI-enabled video sessions.\nRajpurkar predicts that eventually \"we'll move from narrow AI tools to generalist medical AI systems capable of handling multiple tasks across different domains\". It's an approach he's working on with his own company, a2z Radiology AI, which is developing AI-powered analytics for radiologists.\n\"The systems that succeed won't be those claiming to 'replace doctors', but those that thoughtfully redistribute clinical work to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and human-centered,\" says Rajpurkar.\nIn our first 20-minute session, Kirsty asks me a long list of questions about myself, about my pain, and asks me to stretch in different ways \u2013 following her careful lead on the screen \u2013 in order to decide the best course of treatment. She gives me stretches and exercises to try for the week ahead, with careful instruction not to push too hard or do anything that feels uncomfortable.\u00a0\nThis isn't the experience I have in-person with my team of human physical therapists in the US. They frequently correct my posture and tell me when I'm doing something wrong \u2013 which is often. The big difference here is that Kirsty can't see me. Her pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches. They rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss. There's also an option at the end of the session to leave a voice note for a real physiotherapist who will respond to my personal needs or questions \u2013 a real voice behind the curtain.\nMy back felt better after my sessions with Flok, but the app likely isn't for me. I'm clumsy and uncoordinated and need someone watching my form at all times \u2013 if not, I'm likely to hurt myself further. That ability to watch patients and offer feedback on posture could be something AI will enable in the future \u2013 but until then, I'll be sticking with the humans.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

ReutersSir Keir said he was worried about the attitudes of some young boys and menThe four-part series - which Sir Keir previously said he had been watching with his teenage children - follows a family whose lives are blown apart when their teenage son is arrested for killing a female classmate.It also explores the hidden radicalisation of young boys\u00a0through incel culture and the \"manosphere\" - a collection of websites that promote misogyny and hyper-masculinity.Sir Keir said the government should not \"shrug our shoulders\" about confronting the attitudes of some young boys and men. \"I don't think that's the answer,\" he said.NetflixThirteen-year-old schoolboy Jamie is arrested for killing a female classmate in AdolescenceThe rising problem of misogyny and male violence was the subject of Sir Gareth's wide-ranging talk for the BBC's annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture.He said he feared young men were spending too much time gaming, gambling and watching pornography - and that they needed better role models beyond online influencers.Online, he said, they were finding a new kind of role model - one that too often did not have their best interests at heart. \"He added that too many young men are isolated and struggle to express their emotions.Sir Keir said: \"I think it is a time for listening carefully to what Gareth Southgate was saying and responding to it and certainly that's what I want to do. \"The prime minister added that footballers and athletes could be positive role models for young men, but that he thought they were more likely to identify with \"somebody who's in their school\", like a teacher or a sports coach.The creators of Adolescence said they wanted to \"look in the eye of male rage\" with the series.The central character had been \"indoctrinated by voices\" like Andrew Tate's and \"voices a lot more dangerous than Andrew Tate's\", one of its writers, Jack Thorne told Radio 4's Front Row.Thorne and co-writer and star Stephen Graham have accepted an invitation to a parliamentary meeting by Labour MP Josh McAlister to discuss online safety with MPs.The critically acclaimed series was viewed 6.9 million times in its first week in the UK, beating last year's biggest drama Fool Me Once by 200,000.",

        "article_text": "Hovland's victory was his seventh on the PGA Tour\nFamed sport psychologist Bob Rotella constantly reminds his clients that golf is not a pursuit anyone can perfect.\nBut it is a game that still attracts more than its share of perfectionists. Characters such as Viktor Hovland, who dragged himself from apparent golfing oblivion to become the latest winner on the PGA Tour.\nThis out of the blue success was an astonishing turnaround of form and fortune.\n\"It's like you keep drowning and you're running out of air,\" the 27-year-old Norwegian said of his recent travails after beating Justin Thomas in the Valspar Championship last Sunday to land yet another European victory on American soil this year.\nHovland's late surge secures Valspar Championship victory\nEngland's Mansell wins maiden DP Tour title\nEngland's Rhodes holds nerve to claim maiden LET victory\nIt is fair to say Hovland's success was among the least expected in a series of 2025 wins that will surely cheer European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald. This was the Oslo born star's first win since the 2023 Tour Championship.\nThen he was ranked the fourth best player on the world, someone who possessed an unorthodox but highly effective swing and who had solved his problems around the green, seemingly the only aspect holding him back.\nIn short, he looked a complete player, one ready to start winning majors and capable of becoming a dominant figure. The finished article.\nYet, there is no such thing in this game. The pursuit for better never ends and capriciously it brings no guarantees of improvement.\nThere are those who say \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  Rory McIlroy used that very phrase talking about aspects of his own game in the wake of his recent play-off win at the Players Championship.\nBut Hovland most certainly does not fall into that category.\n\"I find it kind of weird that we're professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, 'oh he's a perfectionist, he's out on the perimeter searching too much',\" he commented.\n\"That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments. So if you're not going to try to get better, what are you doing?\"\nThis from a player who had the world at his feet, only to then make a string of swing changes while emulating the Watford FC approach to hiring and firing coaches.\nIn the 574 days that followed his Tour Championship victory, Hovland slumped from first to 137th on the tour's FedEx Cup standings. He had missed the cut in his previous three outings, including starting the Players with a ruinous 80.\nBut the golfer believed the constant tinkering, the pursuit of perfection, to be entirely justified. \"It's not like I'm inventing stuff,\" he said.\nBut what he did realise was that he needed to go back to feels and methods that had previously worked. \"I have data that can show that what I used to do was objectively better than what I'm doing now.\n\"So why shouldn't I try to go back to what I used to do?\"\nHe reconnected with former coach Grant Waite while still pondering whether it was worth heading to Tampa for the tournament he ultimately won. \"I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week,\" Hovland admitted.\nBetween them they found an old feel on the range last Tuesday. It had been lost in pursuit for more speed and its rediscovery was a vital building block.\n\"He's really hard on himself,\" Hovland's caddie Shay Knight told PGATour.com. \"But as soon as he finds some little swing cue or thought, he tends to take it on board, and it happens really fast.\n\"And it just seemed to click; I knew something special was going to happen this week with the swing thought.\"\nHovland was far from perfect and still fearful of losing long shots high and right, but he had a foundation to make him competitive. \"Incredibly, I did make it work and was able to win and I think that is something that I'm extremely proud of,\" he smiled.\nThe game remains \"more stressful than it should be\" but he feels reuniting with Waite, a former tour player, will lead to more success.\n\"He's definitely put his heart and soul into looking at all the different golf swings that I've sent him,\" Hovland said.\n\"It's challenging because I have a very unique pattern and it's unconventional and I would say most coaches probably would like to make my swing more conventional and hopefully try to fix the problem.\n\"But that's not really how my golf swing works. And I really trust Grant, because he he sees it and knows what kind of matchups need to be there for it to work.\"\nHovland's win follows two PGA Tour victories for Northern Ireland's McIlroy already this year as well as big wins for Swede Ludvig Aberg, Austria's Sepp Straka and Belgium's Thomas Detry.\nThese results fuel optimism for a successful Ryder Cup defence for Europe at Bethpage in September. But do not get carried away.\nBack in 2023 Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Sam Burns were posting victories at this time of year, while Brooks Koepka, Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman landed majors. But the US team were soundly beaten in Rome.\nThere are no guarantees in the sport that Rotella, who has advised a string of major winners, insists is not \"a game of perfect\".  So it should not be a surprise that even Hovland's short-term hopes for next month's Masters are tempered.\n\"Some of the shots that I'm hitting, it's going to make it really difficult for me to be in contention at Augusta,\" he admitted.\n\"You're going to hit so many long irons into par-four holes and you've got to drive it pretty far because the fairways are pretty wide.\n\"It's more of a bomber's paradise versus this place (Copperhead in Tampa) where it's more just about being precise off the tee.\n\"So there's still some things that I need to improve, but luckily we've got two weeks and this is certainly nice to have in the back of my mind leading up to Augusta.\"",

The former Ohio senator has said her accomplishments leave him feeling \"humbled\".\nUsha Vance (n\u00e9e Chilukuri) was born and raised in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California, to a mechanical engineer father and a molecular biologist mother who had moved to the US from Andhra Pradesh, India.\nShe graduated with a BA in history from Yale University and was also a Gates Scholar at Cambridge University, where she came away with an MPhil in early modern history.\nIt was as a student at Yale Law School in 2010 that she met Vance, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\nThe experience influenced her future husband's bestselling 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class US Rust Belt. It became a 2020 movie directed by Ron Howard.\nIn his book, Vance writes how he \"fell hard\" for Usha at Yale, describing her as a \"genetic anomaly\" because she possessed so many ideal qualities.\nVance recalls how he \"violated every rule of modern dating\" by telling her he was in love after one date.\nClassmates remember her as someone who stood out in the hyper-competitive world of Ivy League law for her willingness to lend a helping hand.\nCharles Tyler, now a law professor, told the BBC that Usha Vance would take time to advise other students on how to apply for the highly prized judicial clerkships that she herself wanted.\nAnother classmate, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, recalls a similar lack of sharp elbows in Usha Vance.\n\"She was an excellent student, like, top of our law school class,\" she says. \"And sometimes when students are like that, they also, you know, want to maintain an edge over other students.\n\"But she was someone who would always share her outlines [class notes]. They were, like, perfectly organised, you know, colour-coded, the works.\"\nTyler says Usha Vance has a great deal of influence over her husband, although they \"have a very equal partnership\".\nThe other friend concurs.\n\"She's always like a sounding board for him,\" she says. \"And, you know, she's been his spirit guide pretty much since Yale.\"\nUsha Vance's own political views have been the subject of much conjecture.\nWhile her husband has often railed about \"woke\" ideas he says are pushed by Democrats, she was a registered Democrat as recently as a decade ago. Until last summer she was a trial lawyer at San Francisco law firm Munger Tolles & Olson, which boasts its reputation as \"radically progressive\".\nYet she once clerked for Brett Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court justice, on the District of Columbia court of appeals, then clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts - both men are pillars of the highest court's conservative majority.\nOne thing the power couple do seem very much to agree on is the importance of family.\nThe Vances wed in Kentucky in 2014 and have three children: two sons, Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel.\nUsha Vance told Fox News last August that her husband's emphasis on the cultural importance of a loving home stems partly from his own upbringing, but also from \"knowing that the stability and sort of calm that I provide in our family life comes from all the support that I had, the faith that things would be OK, because I had people behind me\".\nIn India, there is immense pride in Usha Vance's storybook life, not least of all from her own relatives.\nHer great-grand-aunt in Andhra Pradesh told the BBC that she is not surprised by the US second lady's success, given that she comes from a long line of Hindu scholars.\nChilukuri Santhamma, a physics professor from Andhra Pradesh, said: \"Not everyone can climb to the top in a foreign country and achieve accolades and it's fortunate that Usha has reached to the position that happens for one in millionth.\"\nAdditional reporting by Soutik Biswas in Delhi",

        "article_text": "It's a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\nIn 2007, I was a recent newcomer to Houston, a humid Texas city on the Gulf of Mexico that felt as foreign to me as if I had moved around the globe. Unsurprisingly, this incredibly diverse city was teeming with international culinary influences. There was Mexican food from across the border; fresh Vietnamese flavours brought by refugees in the 1970s; and New Orleans-style food from people who moved here after Hurricane Katrina. Middle Eastern food was everywhere too, from vast emporiums stocked with brined olives, tabbouleh and vats of hummus to street vendors serving freshly made kebabs. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\nA take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. But what sets the sandwich apart is its creator: Jalal Antone, the Louisiana-born, Texas-raised son of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. His version of a chow chow recipe had a bold Middle Eastern influence, swapping out traditional mustard and celery seeds for paprika and turmeric, giving the relish a striking orange hue and a deeper, spiced complexity.\nAntone dreamed of starting a Middle Eastern import store but was unsure of how it would be received by Houstonians at the time. In 1962, he finally opened Antone's Import Company on Taft Street, selling imported spices, olives, hummus, falafel and tabouli. At the time, most of Houston's half a million residents were unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food. To win them over, he devised a simple but effective solution: a sandwich.\u00a0\n\"Houstonians were eating burgers in those days,\" explains Craig Lieberman, CEO of Antone's. \"The story is that he asked his friends 'How do I sell a product to Houstonians?' They said, 'Come up with a chow chow recipe and put that on your sandwich'.\"\nAntone sourced French bread from a local bakery, layered it with his imported meats and cheeses and added his signature spiced chow chow. The result? A sandwich that became a Houston staple.\u00a0\nBy the late 1960s, Antone's had become a wild success, with people flocking there from far and wide. A postcard dating from Antone's early years describes the store as a \"tempting world of foreign foods\" while a 1965 Houston Chronicle article notes that the store was stocked with cheeses, olives, eels and even squid pickled in their own ink. But what kept people coming back were the sandwiches.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nRestaurant critic Alison Cook remembers eating the affordable, filling Antone's Original sandwiches as a student at Rice University in 1966, describing the experience in a 2017 Houston Chronicle article. \"It was founded to cater primarily to the local Syrian and Lebanese community, but the po' boys made it a mecca for Houstonians of all stripes. To my impressionable 19-year-old brain, the rambling Antone's space was an exotic wonderland, chockablock with foodstuffs from the Middle East and beyond, festooned with sausages and crammed with cheeses I'd never heard of. In a city where steakhouses, seafood palaces and Italian American spots ruled the dining scene, Antone's pointed the way to a wider world.\"\nThrough the 1970s and 80s, the Houston po' boy cemented itself as a local lunchtime staple, on par with tacos and barbecue. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born. Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.\n\"Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,\" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. \"These were really adventurous flavours for people at the time. The story of how they moved forward by creating something unique is why they've lasted so long.\"\nAlthough Antone's original import store is long gone, the Houston po' boy lives on.\u00a0Antone's Famous Po' Boys\u00a0still has two locations in Houston \u2013 one inside\u00a0The Galleria, the city's massive megamall, and another in the\u00a0Heights\u00a0neighbourhood, where you can grab a sandwich alongside Lebanese tabouli and dolmas.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the banh mi the world\u2019s best sandwich?\n\u2022\u00a0The sweet Dutch sandwich that makes no sense\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nIf you can't make it to a sandwich shop, Antone's po' boys are sold in grocery stores across Texas, including\u00a0H-E-B,\u00a0Randall's,\u00a0Kroger, and\u00a0Brookshire Brothers. They're even stocked in hospital cafes and at Texan universities like\u00a0Baylor\u00a0and\u00a0The University of Texas. If you're looking for a taste of Antone's at home, their proprietary chow chow can be bought by the jar at local supermarkets along with their pickles.\nThough Houston's food scene continues to evolve, the po' boy remains a symbol of the city's culinary melting pot \u2013 a sandwich born from Middle Eastern ingenuity, shaped by Southern tradition and beloved by generations of Houstonians.\n\"I can't tell you how many Texans grew up on Antone's,\" says Lieberman. \"We still use the same bread from Royal Bakery and the same recipes that Jalal created; it's a very nostalgic and beloved Texas brand.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Knight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in chargeFfion WynneBBC Sport journalistPublished22 March 2025544 CommentsConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. Nat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. Clare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. Knight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional.",

He attended the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in history and anthropology. \nAfter finishing school, Blanchet worked as a teacher and later led a music non-profit in Montreal. \nThe year Blanchet was elected leader, the Bloc increased the number of seats it had in Parliament, overtaking the New Democrats to become the party with the third-most seats in the House of Commons. \nQuebec voters -  and the province's 78 federal ridings - have in the past dramatically affected election outcomes in Canada. \nThe Bloc's mandate is to be a voice for Quebec in Ottawa. \nAmong the big issues in Quebec right now is the global trade war launched by US President Donald Trump. The province is home to North America's largest primary aluminium production sector. \nTrump has put steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, which has already caused one Quebec aluminium plant - Alubar - to shut down its operations and layoff all 70 of its workers. \nBlanchet has called the tariffs \"ill-advised,\" and said that he believes \"at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail\"\nHe has also come out fiercely against President Donald Trump's musings about making Canada a 51st US state.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nIn responding to these emerging challenges from the US, Blanchet has not strayed away from putting Quebec front and centre in the conversation. \nHis party recently ran advertisements that asked: \"Who will speak for Quebec?\" \n\"We must prevent Quebec from becoming Canada's bargaining chip, speaking primarily for Toronto's banks, Ontario's auto industry, and Western oil companies,\" the advertisement read. \"On the contrary, Quebec must emerge stronger.\"\nThe province has long fiercely defended its identity, and in 2006, the House of Commons recognised that the \"Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois form a nation within a united Canada\".\nSince then, it has passed legislation defending its secularism laws and protecting use of the French language. \nBut threats from the US appear to have deeply worried Quebeckers, who have grown less supportive of Quebec sovereignty since Trump's \"51st state\" rhetoric. \nThose numbers have not deterred Blanchet, however, who said he believes the appetite for Quebec independence will \"come roaring back\" once US-Canada relations stabilise again. \nAs Canada gears up for an election this year, BBC wants to hear from voters across the country.

        "article_text": "With their growing financial resources, 82% of women control travel decisions, and from solo adventure holidays to multi-generational trips, female-first travel is on the rise.\nWomen today are on the move. More than 64% of the world's travellers are women, with 82% responsible for making a family's travel decisions, according to Skift Research's 2024 The Woman Traveler report. Not only that, but women are also travelling in more ways and to more places than ever before.\nSolo female travel is particularly on the rise, with nearly 40% of women travellers planning a solo trip in 2025, according to Skift. This trend also increases with age, as 21% of female travellers aged 55 and up prefer solo travel versus travelling with a spouse or children.\n\"Solo travel as a woman feels like a quiet act of rebellion. It is a radical form of self-care, a bold claim to joy and a path to self-actualisation,\" said Lauran Peoples, a director at Richmond Region Tourism. \"Solo travel allows me to move through the world for no one's benefit but my own. Every time I return, I feel more capable than I give myself credit for. I come back cooler. I come back braver. I come back more in tune with who I truly am.\"\nWith their growing financial resources, women are also discerning, choosing destinations with safety, freedom and welcoming cultures in mind. To aid that process, we pulled together some of the most popular ways women around the world are travelling today.\nGoogle searches for \"solo female travel\" have increased 1,000% in the past decade, as women look to book more and more trips alone. But compared to men, women have slightly different concerns when planning holidays: safety and cultural attitudes continue to rank top of mind.\nAccording to Solo Female Travellers \u2013 a company empowering women to travel solo \u2013 66% of female travellers mark safety as their top concern; a figure unchanged since 2020.\nThe company's index of more than 200 countries (based on current US/UK advisories, the current Global Peace Index and a survey ranking how solo women travellers viewed their risk while travelling) finds a few places consistently topping the list, including Spain, Australia, the Nordic countries, Thailand, the UK, Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia and Japan. Japan, which has one of the world's lowest crime rates, ranked number one for safety and stands out as a memorable destination for many solo female travellers.\u00a0\n\"Japan was by far the easiest country I have ever traveled in solo,\" said Georgia Fowkes, a travel expert at Altezza Travel. \"I felt this peculiar but wonderful mix of excitement and utter ease when I arrived in Tokyo. Whether in Shinjuku's buzzing chaos or Kyoto's quiet corners, the streets felt unbelievably safe, even at night.\"\u00a0\nShe found particular ease in women-only train cars and female-focussed capsule hotels. \"It all adds up to a place where you can truly let your guard down and soak it all in,\" she said.\nFiona Spinks, who writes the blog Following Fiona, echoes the survey's finding about how female travellers feel welcome in New Zealand. \"Here, it wasn't just about the views (although they're unreal). What stood out most was the people and the way travel in New Zealand often became a real community experience,\" she says. \"When I hiked through the Abel Tasman track, total strangers ended up sharing stories and food. Kiwis love chatting, and you'll gain so much insight from local conversations.\"\u00a0\nTo help support other women-owned businesses on their solo adventures Wanderful, a leading women's travel community, recently launched a map highlighting city guides around the world with women-owned shops, cafes and hotels.\n\"Maybe it's the wine, but I laugh more when I travel with women,\" said Kimberlee Lauer, a New Orleans-based senior account executive who travels frequently with her female friends. \"We can be spontaneous and silly together, and we find joy in our shared travel experiences, even when they go awry. I have travelled with my significant others in the past, but I don't really enjoy travelling with men nearly as much as my girlfriends!\"\nLGBTQ+ travellers\nIn light of sweeping new policies some LGBTQ+ travellers to the US may face extra challenges.\n\"Unfortunately, with transphobia, folks who don't perform gender standards are sometimes viewed with suspicion,\" said Lindsey Danis of the travel blog Queer Adventurers, where she recommends finding hotels with LGBTQ+-friendly policies.\nSpartacus World's 2025 Gay Travel index found Canada, Iceland, Malta, Portugal and Spain tied for LGBTQ+-friendliness \u2013 mirroring many of the safety indexes for women.\nValetta, Malta's capital, ranks particularly high on safety with a score of 99.8 on the World Travel Index. LGBTQ+ rights are enshrined in the Maltese constitution, and a large majority of the population supports same-sex marriage and equal rights.\nWhether a girls' getaway or a \"solo-but-not-alone\" trip, group travel built exclusively for women is skyrocketing. Nearly 14% of women are planning a women-only trip in 2025, according to Solo Female Travellers. The survey also found that 36% of women travelled solo on a small group trip, with 8% joining a trip with girlfriends. Road Scholar saw its enrollment in senior-focused women-only tours double in recent years.\u00a0\nMegan Vila, Innovation Manager for TourAxis, recommends women seek out smaller groups and female-led guides. \"Smaller group tours create a more intimate experience and offer a great way to form friendships with other travellers,\" she said. She also recommends itineraries that combine guided activities with plenty of free time. \"Women value expert guidance but also enjoy exploring at their own pace.\"\u00a0\nCruises have emerged as a holiday popular for women, whether already in a group or looking to make new friends. Uniworld recently launched their first women's-only river cruise departing in August 2025 throughout France.\n\"Group tours provide something like a tasting menu of different places, so I can see a bit of each city and decide for myself which ones I may want to come back to in the future. I can travel alone, but I'm not actually by myself,\" explained New York resident and frequent group traveller Jessie Parker. \"Get to know the other people in your tour group. There's an instant connection in your choosing the same trip at the same time, so be open to connecting with them as well, not just the location.\"\nNatural Habitat Adventures also expanded its women-only itineraries by 75% in 2025, noting that 30% of travellers are women travelling solo. The small, women-led group tours cover destinations like Greenland, Alaska and Costa Rica, focusing on wildlife viewing and highlighting women's history in each destination. Adventure travel continues to be a female-majority space \u2013 with women comprising 57% of all adventure travellers.\nWhile solo travel might have once conjured an image of a young, nomadic backpacker, The Woman Traveler Report by Skift recently busted that myth. Only 4% of adults aged 18-24 planned on embarking on solo trips, while nearly 25% of those aged 65 and above planned a similar journey.\nAccording to the report's findings, as women reach retirement age, they look forward to travelling to enjoy freedom and flexibility, escape their routines and challenge themselves. According to a 2023 study by Road Scholar, 85% of the operator's solo travellers are women, and 69% of their overall travellers are women. Barring health or mobility issues, many baby boomer women also set their sights on \"bucket list\" travel.\n\"With retirement came the precious gift of time, a treasure to be cherished; immersing myself in the moments that fill my heart and nourish my spirit,\" said Venida Hudley, who solo travelled to 12 African countries in 11 months and chronicled her adventures at Venida Discovers Africa. \"My passion was innovation, so I looked for out-of-the-box volunteer opportunities that fed my spirit like volunteering with an innovative fashion designer in Gaborone, Botswana, and volunteering with a business that creatively improves the environment like Gjenge Makers in Nairobi, Kenya.\"\u00a0\nA 2025 AARP report cited Europe as the most popular destination for international baby boomer travel, with Italy, Great Britain, France, Spain and Ireland in the top positions. At Scotland-based small-group tour company Rabbie's, seniors aged 60 and over receive discounted prices, and they've seen senior women most interested in \"set-jetting\", checking out the Downton Abbey Castle or Outlander filming locations in Scotland. \"The real-life history behind these famous locations is often just as captivating as the fictional storylines they have watched on screen,\u201d says Rabbie's CEO Hazel Rickett. \"Take Doune Castle, for example. Known to Outlander fans as Castle Leoch, it has centuries of its own stories to tell. Some driver-guides were even extras in the series, so they offer first-hand insights.\"\nAnother growing trend has been the emergence of cross-generational travel, driven in large part by millennials and Gen-Z parents who are including both their children and their own parents on their travels. According to American Express Travel's 2025 Global Travel Trends, 58% of millennials and Gen-Z parents plan to bring their extended family on trips in 2025, up from just more than 30% of Gen-X and baby boomers.\nFemale-focused tour operator Pink Girls Run the World sees a high percentage of its travellers embark as multigenerational trips. \"Plan experiences that can be shared across multiple generations, like afternoon teas,\" suggests founder Tashieka Brewer. \"Over Mother's Day weekend, we're planning a special multi-generational weekend in Bristol, Virginia and we're planning for a unique wine tasting experience at a local vineyard.\"\u00a0\nStephanie Webb of Seesight Tours echoes the sentiment. \"Some of my most meaningful trips have been with family. I took my mom to Italy, where she finally got to see the Amalfi Coast after dreaming about it for years,\" she said. \"Travelling across generations teaches you patience and appreciation. It's about slowing down, choosing activities that suit everyone's energy levels, and focusing on shared experiences rather than just checking off a bucket list. These trips remind me that travel isn't just about the places we see, but the moments we create together.\"\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

But it reduced its prices and said it would provide a way for users not willing to pay to opt to see adverts which are \"less personalised\", in response to regulatory concerns.It said the users will still see ads, but they may be \"less relevant\" to their interests.But social media expert Matt Navarra said he thinks an ad-free subscription would see limited uptake in the UK, which he says has been the case in the EU. \"This means that, among other data protection standards, organisations must demonstrate that people can freely give their consent to processing of their personal information for personalised advertising.",

        "article_text": "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.\nBut there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.\n\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Phillip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.\nIn exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.\nWe're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.\nWater and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.\nPhillip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.\nMore importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.\nSo cheap it made business sense for Phillip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.\nEach machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.\nOccasionally Phillip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.\nAt the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Phillip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.\n\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.\nZengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.\nIt was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.\nBritish-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.\nNow it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.\nAllowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.\n\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.\nThe bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.\nBitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.\nThe town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.\nOnly one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.\nAlthough the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses. \nSo, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.\n\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"\nHe's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.\n\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"\nEmbracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.\nElsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.\nLike many young people, they're glued to their phones.\n\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.\nThe little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.\n\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.\n\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.\n\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"\nNot many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.\nBut soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.\nZengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.\nSoon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.\nPhillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.\nThe company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.\nGridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.\nNorth of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.\nBut Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.\nThe company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.\nThey're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.\n\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.\nThe company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.\nFinding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.\nThe company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.\nBut the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.\nHistory tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.\n\nIn the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.\nAuthorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.\nFor example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.\nAgreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.\nThe environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.\nBut according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.\nSet ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.\nBut they are also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins.",

ReutersSir Keir said he was worried about the attitudes of some young boys and menThe four-part series - which Sir Keir previously said he had been watching with his teenage children - follows a family whose lives are blown apart when their teenage son is arrested for killing a female classmate.It also explores the hidden radicalisation of young boys\u00a0through incel culture and the \"manosphere\" - a collection of websites that promote misogyny and hyper-masculinity.Sir Keir said the government should not \"shrug our shoulders\" about confronting the attitudes of some young boys and men. \"I don't think that's the answer,\" he said.NetflixThirteen-year-old schoolboy Jamie is arrested for killing a female classmate in AdolescenceThe rising problem of misogyny and male violence was the subject of Sir Gareth's wide-ranging talk for the BBC's annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture.He said he feared young men were spending too much time gaming, gambling and watching pornography - and that they needed better role models beyond online influencers.Online, he said, they were finding a new kind of role model - one that too often did not have their best interests at heart. \"He added that too many young men are isolated and struggle to express their emotions.Sir Keir said: \"I think it is a time for listening carefully to what Gareth Southgate was saying and responding to it and certainly that's what I want to do. \"The prime minister added that footballers and athletes could be positive role models for young men, but that he thought they were more likely to identify with \"somebody who's in their school\", like a teacher or a sports coach.The creators of Adolescence said they wanted to \"look in the eye of male rage\" with the series.The central character had been \"indoctrinated by voices\" like Andrew Tate's and \"voices a lot more dangerous than Andrew Tate's\", one of its writers, Jack Thorne told Radio 4's Front Row.Thorne and co-writer and star Stephen Graham have accepted an invitation to a parliamentary meeting by Labour MP Josh McAlister to discuss online safety with MPs.The critically acclaimed series was viewed 6.9 million times in its first week in the UK, beating last year's biggest drama Fool Me Once by 200,000.",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.\nThose discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.\n\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.\n\"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds.\n\"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\"\nThorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.\nChief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.\nBut the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.\n\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"\nHis parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.\nBut Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.\n\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.\n\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"\nThe writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.\nHe found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.\n\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.\n\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.\n\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"\nThese issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.\nOn Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".\n\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.\nThorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.\n\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.\n\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.\n\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"\nSo what could more radical solutions be?\nThis week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.\nViolence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.\nThorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".\n\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.\nHe urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.\nThe writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.\n\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.\nA ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though.\nThorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21.\nWhen asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings.\nOne said it was \"a great idea, within reason\", another said it would be \"quite unfair\", while the third was against the idea, arguing that \"social media has brought a lot of good to young generations as well\".\nFor Thorne, the question about how to police smartphones and social media is about to come very close to home.\nHis son is eight, and Thorne says he wants to make sure he establishes \"a method of communicating with him\" as he grows up. Soon, he will want his own phone.\nWhile working on the series, he has been thinking about how to handle his son's future use of technology. \"And I'm still processing how to do it.\"\nResearching and writing Adolescence has opened his eyes about the challenges facing young people and parents, he says. But how to tackle them? That's the hardest part.",

It is a situation they have been in before - and then been found wanting when it matters.Who makes your England World Cup starting XI?Published6 hours ago'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?Published5 hours agoImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jude Bellingham was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card for a reckless challenge on Raivis JurkovskisThis a problem for Tuchel to solve and one he will be well aware of.But the 51-year-old will have enjoyed the spectacular strike from James, a player he greatly admires and who was a vital part of his Chelsea team that won the Champions League in 2021.Kane's second was also right up the head coach's street, with Declan Rice accelerating into the Latvia area, collecting Morgan Rogers' pass and drilling a ball across the face of the six-yard box which left his captain with a simple finish.What will cheer Tuchel is that he has plenty of raw materials to work with.Bellingham, for all the impetuosity that could - and should - have seen him sent off on Monday, is a generational talent, while Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has demonstrated he is a natural at this level.There was more good news from The Hawthorns where another Gunner, Ethan Nwaneri, excelled in a goalscoring performance for England Under-21s - and the return of a third Arsenal player, Bukayo Saka, will offer an added attacking dimension.Tuchel's task is to find the \"X Factor\", the missing ingredient, to get England's men over the line they have failed to cross since the 1966 World Cup.Two wins from two games is a satisfactory - and totally expected - opening to the Tuchel era, but now he must discover the missing link to enable him to deliver the exciting England side he has promised.And on the somewhat tedious evidence of his first two games, Tuchel will have plenty to exercise his mind between now and the next international camp in June.Related topicsFootballEngland Men's Football Team Marcus Rashford improved slightly on his performance against Albania, but Jarrod Bowen could not make the desired impact as a replacement for struggling Phil Foden.England sent in 21 of those crosses in the first half, the most in a game since they played Poland in October 2013 and delivered 25 - but their only goal game from James' free-kick.In a sign of England's complete domination, they had 569 successful passes in Latvia's half compared to the visitors' 26 in theirs, and must be disappointed such overwhelming statistics resulted in relatively meagre results.Tuchel wants to give England a fresh identity as they try to cross the psychological barrier from a nearly team to winners, but - as so often in the past - the acid test will only truly come when (it is hardly if) they qualify for the 2026 World Cup.Qualifying should be a formality from a group that also contains Andorra and Serbia, so the first high-quality opponents England are likely to meet will be when they get to the World Cup. All very England when it comes to qualifiers - as it should be against a country ranked between Burundi and the Dominican Republic on Fifa's list.Eze scores first England goal as Three Lions beat Latvia Who can be 'a real asset'?",

        "article_text": "Flights have resumed at Heathrow Airport, a day after a fire at a nearby electrical substation shut down operations at one of the world's major transport hubs.\nHeathrow, the UK's busiest airport, said on Saturday morning it was open and fully operational, however flight disruptions are expected to last days.\nBritish Airways estimated 85% of its planned flights would run on Saturday, but with delays throughout. As of 07:00 GMT the majority of departures had left as expected but of arrivals nine of the first 20 flights scheduled to land were cancelled. \nMore than 1,300 flights were affected on Friday, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers were told not to travel to the airport unless their airline advised them to. \nNational Grid said that an \"interim solution\" had been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nFirefighters worked throughout the day to bring the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London, under control.\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added that when the power outage happened the back-up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid transmission network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening, with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nHeathrow said the airport was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, however a number of flights were cancelled and disruptions were expected to last days.\nThe closure had knock-on effects at many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nNational Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.",

        "article_text": "Boxing heavyweight legend George Foreman has died aged 76, according to his family. \nKnown as Big George in the ring, the American built one of the most remarkable and enduring careers in the sport, winning Olympic gold in 1968 and claiming the world heavyweight title twice, 21 years apart - the second making him the oldest champion in history aged 45.\nHe lost his first title to Muhammad Ali in their famous Rumble in the Jungle fight in 1974. But Foreman's professional boxing career boasted an astonishing total of 76 wins including 68 knockouts, almost double that of Ali. \nHe retired from the sport in 1997 but not before he agreed to put his name to a best-selling grill - a decision that went on to bring him fortunes that dwarfed his boxing earnings. \nHis family said in a post on Instagram on Friday night: \"Our hearts are broken.\n\"A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.\"\nThe statement added: \"A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family.\"\nForeman was born in Marshall, Texas, on 10 January 1949, and raised along with six siblings by a single mother in the segregated American South.\nHe dropped out of school and turned to street robberies before eventually finding his outlet in the ring.\nForeman won the heavyweight gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, aged 19, before turning pro and winning 37 consecutive matches. He lost only five bouts over his career.\nHe beat previously undefeated reigning champion Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973 knocking him down six times in the first two rounds.\nHis 1974 Rumble in the Jungle against Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, remains one of the most famous boxing matches ever. \nAli, the older man, was the underdog after he was stripped of his crown seven years earlier for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War.\nForeman reflected on the legendary fight 50 years later in an October interview with BBC World Service Newshour, explaining that everyone thought he was going to decimate Ali. \n\"Oh, he's not going to last one round,\" the boxer said experts were predicting at the time. \nForeman told the BBC he typically would get \"real nervous\" and have \"butterflies\" before any boxing match, but that night - it was the \"most comfortable\" he had felt.\nBut the wily Ali used a tactic that later became known as \"rope-a-dope\", which wore out Foreman, causing him to throw out hundreds of punches before Ali unloaded on him in the eighth round and scored a knockout.\nAfter a second professional loss, Foreman retired in 1977 and became an ordained minister at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Texas, which he founded and built.\nHe told the BBC his defeat to Ali became the \"best thing that ever happened to me\" as it ultimately led him to \"get my message out\" through preaching. \nHe recalled that his preaching started small, on street corners and with friends, then grew. \n\"We began meeting informally at various homes in Houston, and before long, the crowds became too large for most houses to accommodate,\" Foreman said on his website. \n\"Eventually, we bought a piece of land and an old, dilapidated building on the north-east side of Houston.\"\nForeman came out of retirement in 1987 to raise money for a youth centre he founded. He won 24 matches before losing to Evander Holyfield after 12 rounds in 1991.\nIn 1994, Foreman knocked out undefeated Michael Moorer to become the oldest ever heavyweight champion at age 45.\nHe became ad pitchman for his George Foreman Grill, which millions have purchased since it hit the market in 1994, thanks in part to his memorable catchphrase, the \"Lean Mean Grilling Machine\".\nForeman was married five times. He has a dozen children, including five sons who are all named George. \nHe explained on his website that he named them after himself so they \"they would always have something in common\". \n\"I say to them, 'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together,\" he explained. \"And if one goes down, we all go down together!'\"",

        "article_text": "Tomar has won nine of her 13 professional bouts\nPuja Tomar laughs nervously as she reveals her parents did not want her initially because she was a girl.\nIt surprises some of the journalists in the room, but for Tomar - the only Indian woman to ever fight in the UFC - it is the cornerstone of why she is doing this interview.\nHer start in life helped to forge her extraordinary resilience and character, her career, and everything she stands for today.\n\"My family and this society doesn't allow girls, they like only boys,\" Tomar tells BBC Sport. \n\"Before I was born, they wanted a boy. Even when I was a newborn, my mum told me my father didn't want a third girl.\"\nTomar, 31, was born in a small village called Budhana in Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India.\nHistorically, Indian families wanting boys over girls is common, particularly among poor communities, leading to a skewed sex ratio in favour of men.\nThere have been instances where unwanted baby girls have been buried alive and left to die in clay pots in the country.\nThe reasoning is rooted in widely held cultural beliefs that a male child would carry the family name, look after the parents in their old age, and perform the rituals on their death - while daughters would cost them dowries and leave them for their matrimonial homes.\nNo home, food or phone: Blachowicz's 'detox' from life\nI owe the UK fans after last performance - Edwards\nIn 2022, the United Nations estimated that nearly 400,000 female births - or 3% of all female births - are missed annually as a result of gender biased sex selection.\nTomar was the third of three sisters, which led to ridicule from other families because her dad had not fathered a boy. \nBut she did not let the misogyny she faced affect her.\nAfter losing her father at the age of seven, Tomar -  supported by her mum - was instead fuelled by the experience.\n\"After that, I wanted to beat boys. So I learned Jackie Chan movies and kung-fu and how to beat the boys,\" said Tomar.\n\"Even in the road I would go up to boys and say 'hey' \u2013 I tried to fight with boys. I wanted to prove myself.\n\"After that I realised I could be in sports, but nobody told me how to do it. My cousins, my family - nobody allows girls to go outside in India.

        "article_text": "\"Horrific to see in black and white. But hardly surprising,\" is how a top European diplomat reacted to what comes across as deep, heartfelt disdain for European allies, revealed late on Monday, European time, in an online group chat between top US security officials.\nSeemingly by accident, Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was also invited to the chat, which discussed planned strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen aimed at unblocking trade routes on the Suez Canal. He subsequently made the frank exchange public.\nIn the chat, Vice-President JD Vance notes that only 3% of US trade runs through the canal, as opposed to 40% of European trade, after which he and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth complain of European \"free-loading\".\nThe monumental security breach is causing a ruckus at home, with Democrats calling for Hegseth's resignation as a result.\nAcross the pond - aka the Atlantic - Europe's leaders and policy-makers felt \"sick to their stomach\", as an EU official put it to me.\nOfficials quoted here are speaking on condition of anonymity in order to comment freely on what are volatile times in US-European relations. You won't see comments in the public domain, so as not to rock the transatlantic boat any further.\nVance first stunned European officials with his speech at last month's Security Conference in Munich condemning the continent for having misplaced values such as protecting abortion clinics and censoring speech in the media and online. \"The enemy from within,\" he called it.\nMonday's Signal chat strikes at the heart of a slew of tensions, discomfort and plain old fear in Europe right now, that the Trump administration can no longer be relied on as the continent's greatest ally. At a time when Europe is facing off against a resurgent Russia.\nWestern Europe has looked to the US to have its back in terms of security and defence since World War Two.\nBut it is precisely that fact that so riles the Trump administration and has cemented Europe in its mind as \"freeloaders\".\nWhile the US commits 3.7% of its colossal GDP to defence, it's taken the majority of European partners in the transatlantic defence alliance Nato until recently to cough up even 2% of GDP. Some, like big economies Spain and Italy, aren't even there yet, though they say they plan to be soon.\nEurope relies heavily on the US, amongst other things, for intelligence, for aerial defence capabilities and for its nuclear umbrella.\nWith the phasing out of conscription in most European countries, the continent also relies on the around 100,000 battle-ready US troops stationed in Europe to help act as a deterrent against potential aggressors.\nEuropeans have focused more on investing in welfare and social services than defence - collective or otherwise - since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Why on earth should the US pick up the slack, asks the Trump administration.\nOn the leaked group chat, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz laments the state of Europe's naval forces. \"It will have to be the United States that reopens these [Suez] shipping lanes.\"\nThe chat then debates how to ensure that Europe remunerates the US for its actions.\n\"If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,\" states a message from someone called SM - presumed to be deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller.\nEurope is now loudly and publicly discussing spending a lot more on its own defence - hoping to keep Donald Trump onside and an aggressive Russia at bay after Ukraine.\nBut Trump's irritation with Europe is nothing new.\nHe displayed his displeasure during his first term in office: furious about Europe's low defence spending; incandescent over the EU's trade surplus with the US.\nThe United States had been long been taken for a ride and that must stop, seemed to be his sentiment.\nImposing trade tariffs was one of Trump's first responses. Then as now.\nEarlier this month, when Trump threatened eye-watering 200% tariffs on European alcohol in an ongoing trade tit-for-tat, he lambasted the EU as \"abusive\" and \"hostile\" for allegedly taking advantage of the US at any opportunity.\nCoinciding uncomfortably with the leaked Signal chat and its Euro-bashing, the EU's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, along with the head of cabinet of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Washington on Tuesday hoping to launch a charm offensive to try to stave off a new tariff onslaught.\nOn defence, Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that the US wouldn't protect countries that \"didn't pay\".\nHis candidate to be the next US ambassador to Nato says that means Europeans spending 5% of GDP.\nThe UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence, aiming for 2.6% by 2027. France scrapes 2.1% of GDP on military spending annually.\nDuring the Cold War, the common enemy was the Soviet Union, which included swathes of Eastern Europe.\nThe US wanted to keep western Europe close, and for it to stay militarily dependent.\nSince then, there has been growing apathy towards Nato and Europe. Particularly after the 9/11 twin tower attacks in the US.\nAttention in Washington turned to Iraq and Afghanistan. To China.\nPresident Obama was clear he wanted Asia to be his top foreign policy priority.\nTrump is far from the first US president to harrumph at Europe's reluctance to do more for, as well as spend more on, its own defence.\nBut with Trump, there is also a deep ideological split.\nOn social values, as JD Vance alluded to in Munich.\nBut also - and this is key - Trump demonstrates not only an antipathy for Europe and an impatience to get the war in Ukraine \"done and over\", he also displays an affinity for Russia's Vladimir Putin, at a time when Europe considers him an immediate threat to the security and well-being of the whole continent.",

They're really cool little things.\n\"I'm very conscious the birds that come up here are diminishing in number. The environmental impact of what we do on birds is pretty horrendous, so anything I can do that makes people feel emotion or interest when they look at a sculpture is good for the environment.\"\nSara is as adept at explaining the anatomy of the birds and geology of the local rocks as she is at just marvelling at the beauty of the area and its wildlife.\nShe has science degrees from Aberystwyth, Sheffield and Durham, including one in zoology for which she studied sparrows for her dissertation. She is also a qualified teacher.\nBut she also has a lifelong love of art and passion for creating things, engendered by her grandparents and reinforced by her engineer father and a mother who, among other things, is an accomplished potter.\n\"They were all good with their hands,\" Sara says. \"I grew up seeing my parents make stuff, seeing people create.\n\"Everybody can make, everybody is creative.\"\nBack at her cottage in Mickleton, Sara fiddles with a strip of wire as she talks, twisting and reforming it as she eulogises over its malleability.\n\"If it's not the right shape, you can bend it back again,\" she says. \"It's about using your imagination and problem solving.\"\nIt is why science and art make perfect bedfellows, she says.\nAt school in Sutton Coldfield, Sara was encouraged to follow scientific pursuits rather than artistic ones, a distinct separation made between the two disciplines.\n\"I think that's a mistake,\" she says, adding her later forays into artistic pursuits such as  felt-making and now wire modelling are some of the ongoing \"tiny rebellions\" against her earlier enforced segregation.\nScientists and artists both notice things, but while scientists measure, artists interpret, Sara says.\nShe relies on science to produce her art, be it physics to make structures, anatomy to understand the birds or just general \"problem solving\".\n\"I'm bringing science into my sculptures all the time. It's quite a privilege to be able to take something, study it and then try and make it out nothing.\n\"You could build a raven from a million different materials so artists are playing to see what they can use, which is what material scientists do too.\n\"So scientists need artist and artists need science and the two shouldn't be separated.\"\nThere are no blueprints, each of her sculptures is based on meticulous research and a lot of trial and error.\nShe starts with the feet and works her way up, taking about six weeks to complete a model.\nSara has made two ravens, which she has named Huginn and Muninn after the Norse god Odin's own corvid companions.\nHuginn recently spent a few weeks in London as part of the Royal Society of British Artists annual exhibition.\n\"It was an absolute treat to go down and they displayed him beautifully,\" Sara says.\n\"He was just checking everybody out and looking at all the people going past.

        "article_text": "Computers and smartphones might be where most writing is done these days, but typewriters still have work to do in the US.\nPretty much every day, another customer clutching an old typewriter will walk into Mike Marr's shop in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Marr carefully looks the machine over. Invariably, it will be a total mess. Made decades ago, the hunk of heavy metal bristling with moving parts is now laced with years of grime. The keys are too stiff. Or maybe the paper that's supposed to glide through it keeps getting stuck.\n\"Do you think you can get it going again?\" the customer will ask, a touch of anxiety in their voice. Marr, who has been repairing typewriters for more than 20 years, will say he'll give it his best shot.\n\"When they come in and pick that typewriter up, just seeing their smile is everything to us,\" he says. Even in the year 2025, a century and a half after the first commercially successful typewriter was introduced to the American public, surprising numbers of people in the US are still using these machines. And not just for fun \u2013 many of Marr's customers are businesses. \"We're still servicing probably 20 to 25 typewriters a week,\" he says. He employs three other people in his shop to keep up with the demand. \"Isn't that crazy?\"\nIn today's world, internet-connected computers and smartphones are king. They're used for the vast majority of business tasks and transactions. But here and there, in little offices and warehouses, you can still find a well-worn typewriter lingering in the corner. A machine whose keys have been pressed many thousands, if not millions, of times. To this day, typewriters print names on forms. They put addresses on envelopes. They fill out cheques. And the people who use them, generally speaking, have no intention of switching to a computer any time soon \u2013 at least for those particular tasks.\nIt was back in 1953 that Marr's grandfather founded the business he now runs: Marr Office Equipment. Decades ago, a call came through from IBM. The tech giant was looking for a new typewriter distributor in the northeast of the US. Marr's father and uncle, in charge at the time, were over the moon. \"That was the biggest thing that could ever happen to them,\" says Marr. \"Trailer trucks would just pull up and unload IBM after IBM. They'd already be sold. We couldn't keep up with it.\"\nMarr Office Equipment's heyday may be long gone but Marr still knows typewriter users all over his local area. He mentions one that is about a 10 minute drive away, in south Providence \u2013 a law firm named Tomasso & Tomasso, co-owned by brothers John and Ray, both attorneys. \"We sound exactly alike,\" says John, laughing as he introduces himself over the phone. Do they actually still rely on typewriters? Absolutely. \"There's not a day that goes by that we don't use them,\" says Tomasso. \"This is really still the best way.\"\nThe firm's office has three typewriters, John says and his colleagues still use them to type up cheques and fill in legal forms to ensure the details on those documents are legible. Plus, there's a security angle. It's very hard to hack a typewriter since they are not connected to the internet. In 2013, jaw-dropping details emerged about the extent of US intelligence agency surveillance programmes. This prompted the Russian Federal Guard Service (FSO) to revert to typewriters in an attempt to evade eavesdropping. German officials were also reported to be considering a similar move in 2014. (During the Cold War, Soviet spies actually developed techniques for snooping on electric typewriter activity, a form of \"keylogging\" technology \u2013 where the keystrokes inputted on a keyboard are captured. US operatives also reconstructed text from typewriter ribbons \u2013 meaning that even typewriters aren't completely safe.)\nI ask Tomasso whether there are downsides to using the typewriter \u2013 isn't it harder to correct mistakes? No, he replies, he has a model with an \"eraser ribbon\" that seamlessly covers up a mistype. Plus, the typewriters are inexpensive to run. Replacement ink ribbons cost around $5 (\u00a34), he estimates. Replacement printer ink cartridges can cost several times that.\nBesides, Tomasso loves to see his writing materialise instantly on the page in front of him. \"There's more of a sense of accomplishment than just letters that appear on a screen,\" he explains. \"It's one of those amazing devices that just makes our life better \u2013 I think that's the purpose of technology.\"\nFurther west, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a real estate agency called Jarvis Realty, owned and run by Woody Jarvis. \"I'm real old school,\" he says. Jarvis, too, regularly uses a typewriter for office work. He gives the example of putting together an offer of purchase for a client. It'll start on the computer but he'll then print the document out and, should he need to make any modifications, he prefers to use correction fluid and his typewriter rather than re-printing the contract and wasting a lot of paper. \"Our contracts are very legible and easy to understand,\" he says. He'll also occasionally type up a name and address on an envelope for a colleague. \"For me, it works because I know how to make it all work.\"\nTypewriters have had a long and colourful history. Centuries ago, tinkerers came up with early, experimental typing machines but they didn't really catch on. Then, in 1868, the first device actually called a typewriter emerged: the Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer, which was patented that year by four inventors in Milwaukee. One of the group, Christopher Latham Sholes, also invented the Qwerty keyboard. Without him, typing \u2013 even on computers \u2013 might be very different today. By the 20th Century, typewriters were everywhere. Millions of the machines were sold in the first few decades of the 1900s and by the mid-1980s, the typewriter industry was worth more than $1.1bn (\u00a3764m) in the US alone, according to press reports from the time.\nIn the 21st Century, typewriters have remained popular in certain corners of the world, despite the rise of computers. In India, for example, typewriters have found a flourishing market among enthusiasts and are still a common \u2013 albeit steadily vanishing \u2013 sight in courts and government offices.\nJarvis's cousin, Lisa Floading, who works at the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, is a big fan of typewriters. She has 62 of them. \"There's something very inviting about a typewriter waiting with paper in it,\" she explains. \"I have them all over my house.\"\nFloading uses a typewriter every day, she says, to make lists or write letters, and for office admin. \"There it is, you wrote three pages, boom, done. That's kind of lost on the laptop,\" she says. And she'll even bring a typewriter to her local coffee shop sometimes so she can work on it there. People regularly come up to her to ask about it, she says.\nIn June, Floading took part in an event in Milwaukee called Qwertyfest \u2013 intended to celebrate both the typewriter and the Qwerty keyboard layout, in memory of Christopher Latham Sholes. Among the attractions was a room full of typewriters where attendees could simply sit down and type. The sound of clacking keys and carriages returning filled the space. It was once a sound common in typing pools in businesses around the country.\nJim Riegert, now in his 70s, remembers what it used to be like. \"Back then, typewriters were pretty big. Typewriters and adding machines,\" he says, referring to desktop calculators. \"It got really difficult in the typewriter business about 25 years ago,\" he says. \"The internet was coming on and killing us, too.\" He runs Typewriters.com and, despite a decline in sales in recent decades, he still shifts four or five electric IBM typewriters every week. \"I just sold 12 to a prison that's putting them in the library because they don't let prisoners use computers,\" he says. Funeral homes, some of which use typewriters to compile death certificates, are also regular clients.\nRiegert's business is based in the city of Tucker, Georgia. His own office, inside a giant warehouse, is crammed witharound 70 or 80 IBM electric typewriters \u2013 second-hand units, which he services and sells. The build quality is top notch, he stresses. A prime model could set you back $749 (\u00a3594). When they were brand new in 1984 they would sell for around $1,000, but even accounting for inflation they have retained a surprising amount of value in the digital age.\u00a0 \"They're still the best typewriters you can buy,\" he says. These days, demand might be low \u2013 but somehow business remains steady, and profitable.\nIBM, nowadays arguably better known for supercomputers such as Watson, sold its typewriter business to Lexmark in the early 1990s. However, an IBM spokesperson says on very rare occasions, \"some people do ask for old manuals or service documents for typewriters, which we can provide if they're in the archives\". Lexmark, meanwhile, sold its last typewriter in 2002 and no longer has any typewriter-related services, though some of its former distributors still carry out maintenance on IBM Lexmark typewriters.\nIf, on the other hand, you want to buy a brand-new typewriter, that too remains possible. Many thousands are still manufactured every year. Todd Althoff is president of Royal, a US company that has been making typewriters since 1904. \"We're going to continue,\" he insists. \"Obviously [there is] not that much growth but it's sustainable and we keep the factory busy.\"\nThe factory is in Indonesia, he explains, and is run by a team from Nakajima, a typewriter manufacturing firm from Japan. Every year, Royal still sells around 20,000 new electric typewriters and more than double that amount of mechanical typewriters. The latter have become desirable partly as decoration \u2013 a librarian might buy one for a display at the front of their library, for instance, suggests Althoff. The mechanical and electric models Royal sells cost between $300 (\u00a3238) and $400 (\u00a3317).\nThankfully, there are still companies that make new typewriter ribbons, notes Paul Lundy, who runs Bremerton Office Machine Company, a typewriter repair business in Seattle. \"Those accessories are readily available,\" he says. \"As a person who repairs typewriters, that's always running at the back of my mind \u2013 why are businesses still using these things?\"\nBut he has some good examples, including workers in warehouses who must continually process the transfer of goods by filling out forms. It's hard to feed these complex forms into a computer printer so that information gets printed onto them in exactly the right places. So, says Lundy, the warehouse workers prefer to insert the form into a typewriter and type it up by sight instead.\nOver the years, he's noticed that some aging typewriter parts are becoming more fragile, in some cases possibly as a result of plastic fatigue. But overall, they remain \"incredibly durable\" machines, he says.\nAnd, best of all, when you sit down to use one, there are no distractions. You just type. One of Lundy's customers who appreciates this perhaps more than most is Anjali Banerjee, a novelist who lives in Seattle. She has published 15 books and she wrote the first drafts of the last three on a typewriter.\nSome years ago, Banerjee began getting increasingly frustrated when trying to type new material on her computer. Notifications kept popping up or her word processing software would repeatedly intervene on things like spelling and grammar. So she went out and bought a typewriter.\nBanerjee started with an electric model but then got interested in mechanical versions. Now, she claims that her first drafts emerge more fluidly when she sits down at a typewriter rather than a screen. \"I have to keep moving forward. The story moves faster, if that makes sense,\" she says. \"You have to put it out there, like clay.\" The further editing \u2013 or shaping of the clay \u2013 takes place after she scans the typewriter-produced drafts into her computer.\nBanerjee goes on to admit candidly: \"I developed what we call 'typewriter fever'.\"\nFollowing her first typewriter purchase in 2019, she built up an astonishing collection of no fewer than 120 machines. However, she has recently slimmed this down to about 80 typewriters and plans to sell off roughly half of those. In essence, it became an epic search to find her perfect typewriter. And Banerjee has definitely discovered some personal favourites, such as her Olivetti Studio 45, an Italian-made model. The author, who also plays piano, compares typing on a typewriter to playing a tune on the instrument. It's percussive. And it requires more effort from your hands and fingers than a computer keyboard. She has sought out typewriters that are just right \u2013 not too stiff, not too loose. But a good, deep \"throw\" (the depth of key press required) is satisfying, she adds.\nTypewriters engage the senses, says Banerjee. You hear the energetic clack-clack-clack of the keys as you work away. You might even detect the musty aroma of old offices or maybe long-faded cigarettes. In that atmosphere of industry distilled, you focus in on what you're doing. \"I lose time,\" she says. She'll look up and two hours may have gone by. Her thoughts are right there on the pages in front of her.\nAs long as there are writers like Banerjee, and office workers who prize well-practised convenience over modernity, typewriters will never be completely obsolete, it seems.\nThat ought to keep Mike Marr busy, at his shop in Rhode Island. \"I was born and bred to repair typewriters and office equipment,\" he says. \"It's all I know in life.\"\nMany of the ailing machines that customers bring to him are fundamentally in good condition, merely requiring a clean and a re-oiling of their moving parts. A smattering of decades-old grease in the machine's tightest nooks and crannies has simply dried up. But that's an easy fix. The typewriter itself is perfectly fine \u2013 and it has plenty more work to do.\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

As did most in the room.\n\"Skopje wasn't quite as developed as it is now, but it was a glorious day and we had walked along the river from the city to the stadium,\" recalls newspaper journalist Neil Moxley, who had covered Wales for several campaigns. \n\"As we walked, I can remember thinking what kind of questions we were going to ask Chris Coleman, who was a great guy to work with but hadn't had the easiest of rides.\n\"You had the Bale angle, but it was a bit of a dead-rubber of a game \u2013 and then the whispers had started. The manager had forgotten his passport and hadn't travelled.\"\nAs the team \u2013 Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Ben Davies and all \u2013 began to train on the uninviting pitch on the other side of the wall, Football Association of Wales (FAW) officials were simply saying Coleman was delayed by \"passport issues\".\n\"That's all I was told I could say,\" laughs Symons now, having had the uncomfortable job of trying to show all was normal. \n\"It was going to be resolved and he'd be there in plenty of time for the game \u2013 but I knew I was going to get battered.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWales boss Bellamy pleased with 'positive' Kazakhstan result\nColeman had realised his \"passport issue\" the previous night, but Symons only knew the former Fulham and Crystal Palace defender's dash to the nearby Newport passport office for an emergency replacement was in vain when he was not boarding the chartered flight in the morning.\nInstead, a convoluted alternative flight with stops via other European hubs awaited Coleman, as did the headlines.\nFor a football nation still smarting from some of the mockery of the years under Bobby Gould \u2013 with training ground wrestling and practice matches on prison grounds \u2013 the words embarrassing and farcical again found their way into the copy filed.\n\"We knew what was coming, but in reality all your work is done by that point,\" recalls Symons. \n\"The training the night before a game is by and large a stretch of the legs after travelling. \n\"You don't even go through set pieces or shape because you know some of the locals will be watching.\n\"It didn't really matter \u2013 but it didn't look good either.\"\nNot when Bale's presence alone - followed all week by Spanish photographers with his move to Madrid still fresh \u2013 put a global focus on matters.\nAnd certainly not for a manager still trying to win over critics and supporters.\nFAW chief executive Jonathan Ford had conceded defeat on trying to downplay things on the night, but later put it: \"We've all misplaced wallets or passports or whatever, it's just when you're in the position of national team manager you do it with a megaphone.\"\nAnd, even in the early days of social media, the unusual tale had long since found its way back home.\n\"Sometimes you write stories with a heavy heart because you like them as a person,\" adds Moxley. \n\"They try and say there's no new stories in football \u2013 but an international manager missing the night before a game because he'd lost his passport? This was definitely one.\"\n\"Do I have anything to say? No, but you have obviously. You write it. We are building a good little team here, but you won't write about that.\"\nChris Coleman was not so much defensive as on the attack as he faced up to questions over his blunder in the aftermath of a 2-1 defeat.\nHe had a point too; performances had been increasingly promising and there had been signs of a team and manager finding their feet together.\n\"That was the thing, we actually played well that night and deserved something from the game,\" recalls midfielder Joe Ledley. \n\"I remember the conditions being quite difficult; the pitch was really dry and bobbly, and they were really physical against us as a relatively young side.\n\"The manager not being there the night before didn't make any difference \u2013 we didn't even really notice until we were on the plane, and even then we had a bit of laugh about it.\n\"We lost and were gutted, but I remember feeling we still felt we were progressing and getting close to being where we wanted to be and taking the next step to achieving what we wanted.\n\"But it's Wales for you - nothing's ever straightforward.\"\nChris Coleman is currently in charge of Belgian top flight side OH Leuven\nA deflected free-kick had given the hosts the lead before Ramsey won and converted a penalty to equalise, only for Aleksandar Trajkovski to make the most of a late lapse of concentration.\nInjuries had hit the squad too. Bale's only involvement in the game was to fend off a couple of local autograph hunters who rushed onto the pitch at half-time. \nNot able to shake off a foot problem, he had been named on the bench by Coleman - but only to keep the opposition guessing, something that had confused supporters.\nThe result officially ended 2014 World Cup qualification hopes and \u2013 with a new contract still not agreed between the FAW and the manager \u2013 some wondered if it would be the end of his reign, well before the Euro 2016 success that was to come.\n\"We had been going along nicely, but I'd brought it upon myself and I was angry that I'd done that,\" said Coleman a few years later. \n\"I'd messed up but I just knew if they could stay with me, then we could be ready to take things on in the next campaign.\"\nBellamy \u2013 who would call time on his Wales playing days the following month \u2013 spoke glowingly of Ramsey's potential, as the playmaker showed he was back to his best form since his horrific leg break a few years earlier.\nBut it was what players said in private to officials and the media in the hours afterwards that was most significant.\nAfter the publication of the headlines which hit out at Coleman for the defeat and his passport gaffe, a number of senior players made their feelings known that \u2013 after some initial struggles together \u2013 they were fully on board with Coleman and his aims.\nThis video can not be played\nWorld Cup qualifying: Wales 3 - 1 Kazakhstan\nCaptain Ashley Williams was one of those who texted out his feelings to \"lay off the gaffer\", saying the players should not escape criticism but together they would get it right.\n\"We loved him [Coleman] and nights like that when he was under pressure, which we thought was unfair, made those bonds stronger,\" says Ledley, one of the players from that night who went on to reach the semi-finals of the Euros less than three years later.\n\"We knew we were onto something. It had been difficult for us and him after Gary, but we could see he was the right person.\"\nColeman was unaware of the texts of support that made their way to journalists that night but officials picked up on the fact senior players were now clearly behind the manager. A new contract was offered and signed.\n\"He had such a strong relationship with the players,\" said Symons.\n\"He knew he messed up and what people would think on the outside but inside he had their trust and those messages showed they wanted to protect him.\n\"People talk about Together Stronger for Wales, and that was it there.\n\"And because we all know what happened after, you can smile at it \u2013 and probably helped.\"\nNo laughing matter at the time, Coleman has since raised a smile at the events of Skopje that started with shambles but eventually led to a sense of where Wales were going under his charge.\n\"It didn't mean we didn't give him loads of stick about it,\" laughs Ledley.\nSymons adds that every subsequent away fixture would see scores of smiling team officials ask Coleman to check he knew where his passport was.\nAnd it does not diminish the tale's claim to be one of the more weird and wonderful in Welsh football.\n\"I've been privileged enough to cover some incredible moments and occasions following Wales,\" adds Moxley. \n\"But that trip to Skopje was the stand out story \u2013 especially when you know what happened next.\"",

        "article_text": "There are few US presidential actions more sensitive, more fraught with peril, than when and where to use American military force.\nIf such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives \u2013 and national foreign policy objectives - at risk.\nFortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.\nUnfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.\nThe Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief, in an article posted on Monday on his publication's website, says he appears to have been inadvertently added to the chat by White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz.\nMembers of the group seemed to include Vice-President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others.\nA National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread \"appears to be authentic\".\nGoldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike \u2013 conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team.\n\"Amazing job,\" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March.\nHe followed up with emojis of a US flag, a fist and fire. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.\nThese White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.\nThat an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.\nAnd that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.\n\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.\nDemocratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.\n\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.\nCriticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.\nDon Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"\nWith Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.\n\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"\nTrump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.\nThe White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \nBy Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.\nIn its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.\nJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.\nWhile the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.\nHe noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"\nThe vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".\n\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\nThis is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.\nDick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.\nThis is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.\nLike this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.\nTheir revelation also proved to be politically damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.\n\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.\nOn Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Prime Minister and Liberal leader Mark Carney has called an election in Canada, kickstarting five weeks of campaigning before Canadians head to the polls.\nVoting day will officially be on Monday 28 April.\nIt will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the two major parties in Canada - the Conservatives and the Liberals - are neck-and-neck in the polls, making it a race to watch.\nWhile Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.\nHere is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major parties.\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few days.\nHis party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.\nFor many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.\nHe was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. \nCarney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.\nBut Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. His French is also weak, which could be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec. \nRecent polls show his party is slightly trailing behind the Conservatives, but more Canadians say they think Carney would be a better prime minister than his opponent Pierre Poilievre.\nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.\nSince then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.\nHe is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government.\nIt is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.\nBut the Liberal Party has since caught up to him in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader.\nPoilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".\nPoilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first.\"\nTrump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.\nStill, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.\nBlanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, calling Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nHe has also dismissed Trump's tariffs, saying: \"I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.\"\nOn domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs.\nBlanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.\nPolling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.\nIn 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.\nThe NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\nBut in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.\nAt the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\nBut his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls show that only 9% of Canadians intend to vote for them as of mid-March, with their ground shrinking while support for the Liberals has risen.\nA big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. \nIn the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.\nAs Canada gears up for an election this year, the BBC wants to hear from voters across the country.

Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.But the Liberal Party has since caught up to him in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader.Poilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".Poilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first. \"Trump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois BlanchetGetty ImagesYves-Fran\u00e7ois BlanchetThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.Still, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.Blanchet has led the party since 2019. \"On domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs.Blanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.Polling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet SinghGetty ImagesJagmeet Singh Singh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.But Carney is politically untested.",

        "article_text": "The main rival to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been formally arrested and charged with corruption.\nEkrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, is expected to be selected as the opposition Republican People's Party's (CHP) 2028 presidential nominee in a ballot on Sunday. \nHe has denied the allegations and said they are politically motivated. \"I will never bow,\" he wrote on X before he was remanded in custody.\nHis detention sparked some of Turkey's largest protests in more than a decade. Erdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the CHP of trying to \"disturb the peace and polarise our people\".\nImamoglu was one of more than 100 people, including other politicians, journalists and businessmen, detained as part of an investigation on Wednesday, triggering four consecutive nights of demonstrations.\nOn Sunday, he was formally arrested and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\".\nHe was remanded in custody pending trial. AFP and local media reported he had been taken to a prison in Silivri.\nIn social media posts, Imamoglu criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\", and said judicial procedure was not being followed.\nHe urged people across the country to join protests and to take part in Sunday's vote. Imamoglu is the only person running in the CHP's presidential candidate selection.\nLarge crowds had already gathered near Istanbul's city hall by early evening, and could be seen waving Turkish flags and chanting in front of a row of riot police.\nAs night began to fall, officers were seen firing water cannons at some protesters.\nThe arrest does not prevent Imamoglu's candidacy and election as president, but if he is convicted of any of the charges against him, he will not be able to run. \nThe jailed politician is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president.\nHowever, due to term limits, Erdogan cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution.\nOpposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the Ministry of Justice has criticised those connecting Erdogan to the arrests, and insist on its judicial independence.\nImamoglu has meanwhile been suspended from his post as Instanbul's mayor, Turkey's interior ministry said in a statement.\nProsecutors also want to charge Imamoglu with \"aiding an armed terrorist organisation\", but the Turkish court said it was not currently necessary.\nThe CHP had a de facto alliance with the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) in connection with last year's local elections. \nDEM has been accused of being affiliated with the PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - which it denies. \nThe PKK declared a ceasefire early this month, after waging an insurgency against Turkey for more than 40 years. It is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.\nMeanwhile, Istanbul University announced on Tuesday it was revoking Imamoglu's degree due to alleged irregularities.\nIf upheld, this would put his ability to run as president into doubt, since the Turkish constitution says presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\nImamoglu's lawyers said they would appeal the decision to revoke his degree to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\nThe Supreme Election Council will decide whether Imamoglu is qualified to be a candidate.\nThousands have taken to the streets across Turkey in largely peaceful demonstrations since Imamoglu's detention on Wednesday.\nAn initial four-day ban on gatherings in Istanbul, designed to stifle protests, now covers the whole country. It was extended for another four days on Saturday.\nMore than 700 arrests have been made since the protests began, according to Turkish authorities.\nRiot police have repeatedly clashed with protesters and have been seen firing pepper gas and water cannons towards them.\nOn Saturday, tear gas hung in the air outside the mayor's office in Istanbul before the protests had even started. \nAs the crowds grew throughout the evening, it became hard to breathe as round after round was fired to disperse demonstrators.\nChanting \"rights, law, justice\", people of all ages defied the government ban to protest against what they saw as an unlawful detention.\nOne young woman, dressed in black and wearing a face mask, told the BBC she was not protesting for political reasons or because she supported the opposition, but instead to defend democracy.\n\"I'm here for justice, I'm here for liberty. We're free people and Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\"\nAnother woman, who had brought her 11-year-old son to the protests, said she wanted to include him because she is worried about his future.\n\"It's getting harder to live in Turkey day by day, we can't control our lives, we can't choose who we want and there is no real justice here,\" she said.",

The Red Roses started in clinical fashion, the returning Claudia MacDonald scoring the bonus-point try inside 30 minutes.\nBut the second half was more of a struggle for England, who came up against a much-improved Italy and were limited to Emma Sing's try in the closing minutes.\n\"It's a really good start. We had new combinations and built really good pressure,\" Mitchell told BBC Sport.\n\"What let the pressure off was a little bit of [lack of] urgency to the breakdown and then execution was probably the only thing that let us down in terms of building pressure in the second half.\n\"We wanted to build pressure and we have got started with that, but Italy threw a few punches at us as well and we had to deal with that.\n\"If we don't get punches, how do you learn to get better? I think we will be better for that. Next week [against Wales] will be a new combination again. We have a bit of work to do on cohesion.\"\nMia Venner (left) and Claudia MacDonald both scored tries for England in the first half against Italy\nEngland's fresh-looking back three scored 21 points in York and proved more than able replacements in the first half.\nGloucester-Hartpury wing Mia Venner, 22, was playing her first Red Roses game in five years. She looked a threat from her first touch, with her sharp footwork and lethal speed opening the scoring with a well-deserved try.\nCreating a dual playmaker system by shifting Holly Aitchison to inside centre and starting versatile back Helena Rowland at fly-half was another new combination which helped England get an advantage in the wider channels in the first 40 minutes.\nDebutant GB Sevens player Jade Shekells brought a physical presence off the bench to bounce off multiple Italian defenders, while replacement scrum-half Flo Robinson, through various snipes, also looked bright on her first cap.\n\"One of the challenges John's got is giving debuts and giving game time to young players, but trying to create synergy in the side,\" former England head coach Simon Middleton told BBC Sport.\n\"There were lots of changes and it's really hard to get cohesion.\"\nMitchell - Middleton's successor - believes it is likely to be during the middle of the tournament when England will start clicking \"connection-wise\".\nMaggie Alphonsi, a 2014 World Cup winner with England, added: \"John's thinking about the end [the World Cup] in mind. He's got to accept that there are going to be errors and there are learnings from it. We also knew that they weren't going to be perfect today.\n\"The key thing is about making sure they develop that cohesion and build those combinations.\n\"It's about peaking at the right time. New Zealand have done it several times, they've peaked at the right time for a World Cup and they've had errors along the way.\"\nEngland, who are chasing a fourth successive Grand Slam, next face Wales at Principality Stadium on Saturday.\nWith their winning streak now at 21 games, another England victory is expected, especially following Wales' opening-round defeat by Scotland.\nWhether Mitchell continues to tinker with his side is less predictable, as he continues to develop his winning-machine in the year that will define his side's success.",

By one man. With a particular interest in stamps.\nDr Borthwick explains that \"panic\" first set in when a National Records of Scotland (NRS) employee attended an auction in London in 1994.\nThey discovered that 200 of the items up for sale belonged to NRS.\nThese should have been safely in Scotland's archives, not being offloaded to the highest bidder via a bang of the auctioneer's gavel.\nNRS can date back all their archive users to 1847. After some cross referencing, Dr Borthwick and his team realised that the auction items all linked back to one person \u2013 Prof David Stirling Macmillan.\nProf Macmillan was born in 1925 and was from Girvan, Ayrshire. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and studied history at the University of Glasgow.\nHis right to use the national archives had been revoked in 1980 when he was caught removing a document. Staff assumed this was a one-off.\nBut the truth was that Prof Macmillan had been helping himself since 1949.\nThe 200 items that turned up in the London auction were the tip of the iceberg.\nNow National Records of Scotland are revealing the scale of his thefts. And the odd nature of them.\nProf Macmillan wasn't pinching documents that were worth a lot of money, or even those that were particularly historically significant.\nThe archives include letters from Robert Burns and Mary Queen of Scots. But these weren't his targets.\nThe contents of many of the letters he took are mundane, perhaps even boring.\nBut a lifelong interest in stamps and postmarks seem to have led to him taking letters that caught his eye. Including documents dating back to 1637.\nOne example was a letter from a Scot who'd moved to the island of Madeira, off the north west coast of Africa. In 1813 they wrote to a friend with some news and gossip. Not exactly explosive stuff.\nAnd yet Prof Macmillan ripped it out of the book it was stored in and pocketed it.\nWe can't be certain about the motivations involved, but the interesting postmark and wax seal on the document are thought to be what tempted the professor.\nThe thief went to great lengths to cover his tracks.\nHe would remove reference numbers from documents and sometimes replace what he had taken with forgeries.\nIronically, Prof Macmillan was himself a professional archivist. He held that role at the University of Sydney and even placed an appeal for historical papers in the university newspaper.\nThe man who spent years stealing documents stressed they would be \"properly looked after\" and bemoaned the fact that so much of history had been \"destroyed or lost\".\nThe academic moved to Trent University in Canada in 1968 and spent 20 years teaching history, though he still seems to have made annual visits to Scotland's archives. He died in 1987, leaving no immediate family.\nMuch of his collection then found its way into the archives of Trent University, where they remained for some time. They were catalogued and descriptions were put online.\nIn 2012. Dr Alan Borthwick was still trying to track down what had been taken. He realised that thousands of the Trent University items rightly belonged to NRS and other UK institutions.\nDr Borthwick was dispatched to North America to investigate.\nHe says he was amazed by the \"sheer quantity of documents\" he found that had been stolen by Prof Macmillan.\nThe chief executive of NRS, Alison Byrne, echoes this. She described the scale of Prof Macmillan's thefts as \"unprecedented\".\nShe only took up her role six months ago, and was appalled when she was filled in on the situation.\nSecuring the return of these documents was one thing. But finding their rightful home was arguably the bigger task.\nFor decades, Dr Borthwick and his team have been \"piecing together the jigsaw\", undertaking the painstaking process of finding the correct place for all of these stolen items.\nFor context, National Records of Scotland are the custodians of 38 million documents. \nThey have 50 miles (80km) of shelving \u2013 enough to stretch from Edinburgh to Glasgow.\nTheir archives are all about precision \u2013 every document has an exact home that makes locating it straightforward.\nThe team wanted to get each item that Prof Macmillan had taken brought back to its rightful place.\nFortunately, NRS \"daybooks\" show what he was signing out of the archives. But his attempts to cover his tracks and remove identifying marks complicated the challenge.\nNow National Records of Scotland say they have got almost everything back where it should be, ready to be pored over by a new generation of historians.\nBut, for Dr Borthwick, how does it feel to know that a fellow archivist so egregiously abused the trust that was put in him?\nThe historian labels it \"a kick in the teeth\". He's been trying to undo the damage done by Prof Macmillan for almost all of his working life.\nThat time could have been spent on other historical projects.\nBut Dr Borthwick reflects that there's a \"sense of satisfaction\" in solving the mystery of the missing documents.\nDocuments that, these days, are kept under the watchful eye of CCTV.",

Bears' South African centre Janse van Rensburg then collected Byrne's high kick-off and raced through the visitors' defence to score the fifth try in 10 minutes.The tit-for-tat try scoring then cooled with Bears getting consecutive tries for the first time in the match when Williams touched down for his second from another quick Bears line-out move, securing his side their first bonus point.Jenkins' pick and go kept Exeter in it and made it 26-19 with 20 minutes played.Bates crossed for the second time eight minutes later, with Exeter's England centre Henry Slade then failing a head injury assessment after being hit hard by Bears number eight Viliame Mata in the build up.Hodge secured Exeter a bonus point when he scored a try from his own chipped ball and Rob Baxter's side received a further boost when Grondona was sent off for catching Moloney's face with his head.However, being a man down seemed no problem for Bears as Randall sniped over to take the score to 40-24 at half-time.Following the highest scoring first half in the league's history, Bears firmly pulled away at the start of the second as back row replacement Steve Luatua rode tackles from Richard Capstick and Will Rigg to power over.Bates then completed his hat-trick thanks to the intuition of scrum-half Randall's quick tap penalty and incisive running, which had caused chaos for the Chiefs defence throughout the match.That proved to be the end of the hosts' scoring, although Exeter grabbed consolation tries through substitute hooker Jack Yeandle and centre Rigg to take Chiefs' try tally up to six and 14 in total.

As a kicking unit we wanted to go there and flash our talent, let the scouts know that we are there for a reason and on merit,\" said McNamee.  \n\"I wasn't overly focused on the numbers but more the process of kicking and making sure we came across well.\"\nThe pair know that being in the international class, they have to work just that little bit harder than their American peers to catch the scouts' eyes.\n\"You're definitely an underdog,\" said Bolger. \n\"There's a low expectation but then there is a really high ceiling.  When you're going kick-for-kick alongside Americans and then are doing better than them, that's when the scouts here are impressed.\"\nJude McAtamney (right) last November became the first Irish-born placekicker to feature in a regular season NFL game since 1985 while Charlie Smyth (left) remains part of the New Orleans practice squad as he also attempts to forge an NFL career\nUnlike McNamee, who went straight from gaelic football into the IPP programme, Bolger has just completed two years' college experience as a kicker and punter with the Idaho State Bengals after his talent was discovered and honed by the Irish kicking coach and mentor Tadhg Leader.\n\"Once I got a full scholarship, that was the time when I really believed I could do it.  I gauged myself against American lads and that gave me the confidence that what Tadhg was saying was right,\" added the Laois man.\n\"And I have great memories \u2013 two years playing college football in the States was a class experience. I played in front of 35,000 against Oregon State in the opening game of last season in a great atmosphere.\"\nAs Pro Day approaches, McNamee says they have taken much inspiration from Smyth and McAtamney's path to the big time this time last year.\n\"It was amazing to see someone could go from playing gaelic football to competing at the NFL Combine. Once I saw that I knew I had a skill that would transfer well if I was given time to prepare,\" the Ballyboden GAA goalkeeper added.\n\"Charlie was the trailblazer for me. He's incredible and confidence just radiates from him. \n\"He was the youngest in the group last year and to be able to come in and compete as well as he did at the Combine and Pro Day and then get signed... it's unbelievable he was able to do it.\"\nAs for making that same transaction from Gaelic to American football, both McNamee and Bolger have worked hard on mastering a different kicking technique, with both likening it to perfecting a golf swing.\n\"The sweet spot in the ball in Gaelic is lower than on a ball in American football,\" McNamee explained.  \n\"Initially, I started kicking the ball too low which meant it was over-rotating and getting no distance.  So it was adjusting my angle and swing and once I'd found where the sweet spot was I was able to introduce power into it and dive a bit deeper into the foot angle, follow through, aim and finish.  \n\"I don't really think about it now \u2013 it's more natural and I kick that ball like I've been doing it for years.  As my technique's improved, I've added distance and there's more to come.\"\nFor Bolger, it's about doing the hard work in the gym away from the field. \n\"Once I was at college I realised there was more to it than biceps curls and looking in the mirror. At Idaho State, I was in the gym with the heavy weights on my back every day. That has helped with my kicking distance.  \n\"A lot of it is mastering technique too, of course. You have to learn to keep swinging your leg the same and keep your technique. You can overthink it sometimes, definitely.\"\n\nNFL fixtures and results\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

They are paid by the company that is buying the goods as opposed to the overseas business that is selling the product. \nSince taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly used tariffs - or the threat of them - in an attempt to gain leverage in a range of disputes, only some of which are related to trade. \nHe said on Monday he still planned to impose tariffs on specific products, including cars, lumber and computer chips, claiming the possibility of such measures were already helping to spur investment in the US. \nHis latest threat against Venezuela is expected to raise pressure on current buyers of oil - which include China, India and Spain - to reduce their dealings in the country, which have provided a critical financial lifeline to the Venezuelan government. \nTrump has already raised tariffs on Chinese imports to at least 20% since February.  He told reporters he intended the latest announcement to be added on top of existing levies.\nFor Venezuela, China is a major buyer of its oil. But Venezuela is not a big source of crude for China, which imported more than 11 million barrels per day last year. \nThe US is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, as a result of exemptions from economic sanctions granted to US oil firm Chevron. \nThe Trump administration has previously signalled its intention to end those exemptions.\nOn Monday, the administration updated its order, giving Chevron until 27 May to wind down its operations in Venezuela, extending the deadline by two months.\nChevron declined to comment. \nOil prices rose more than 1% after the announcement.",

        "article_text": "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.\nBut there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.\n\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Phillip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.\nIn exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.\nWe're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.\nWater and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.\nPhillip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.\nMore importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.\nSo cheap it made business sense for Phillip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.\nEach machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.\nOccasionally Phillip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.\nAt the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Phillip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.\n\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.\nZengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.\nIt was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.\nBritish-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.\nNow it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.\nAllowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.\n\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.\nThe bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.\nBitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.\nThe town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.\nOnly one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.\nAlthough the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses. \nSo, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.\n\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"\nHe's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.\n\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"\nEmbracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.\nElsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.\nLike many young people, they're glued to their phones.\n\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.\nThe little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.\n\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.\n\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.\n\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"\nNot many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.\nBut soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.\nZengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.\nSoon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.\nPhillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.\nThe company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.\nGridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.\nNorth of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.\nBut Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.\nThe company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.\nThey're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.\n\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.\nThe company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.\nFinding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.\nThe company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.\nBut the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.\nHistory tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.\n\nIn the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.\nAuthorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.\nFor example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.\nAgreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.\nThe environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.\nBut according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.\nSet ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.\nBut they are also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins.",

        "article_text": "With their growing financial resources, 82% of women control travel decisions, and from solo adventure holidays to multi-generational trips, female-first travel is on the rise.\nWomen today are on the move. More than 64% of the world's travellers are women, with 82% responsible for making a family's travel decisions, according to Skift Research's 2024 The Woman Traveler report. Not only that, but women are also travelling in more ways and to more places than ever before.\nSolo female travel is particularly on the rise, with nearly 40% of women travellers planning a solo trip in 2025, according to Skift. This trend also increases with age, as 21% of female travellers aged 55 and up prefer solo travel versus travelling with a spouse or children.\n\"Solo travel as a woman feels like a quiet act of rebellion. It is a radical form of self-care, a bold claim to joy and a path to self-actualisation,\" said Lauran Peoples, a director at Richmond Region Tourism in Canada. \"Solo travel allows me to move through the world for no one's benefit but my own. Every time I return, I feel more capable than I give myself credit for. I come back cooler. I come back braver. I come back more in tune with who I truly am.\"\nWith their growing financial resources, women are also discerning, choosing destinations with safety, freedom and welcoming cultures in mind. To aid that process, we pulled together some of the most popular ways women around the world are travelling today.\nGoogle searches for \"solo female travel\" have increased 1,000% in the past decade, as women look to book more and more trips alone. But compared to men, women have slightly different concerns when planning holidays: safety and cultural attitudes continue to rank top of mind.\nAccording to Solo Female Travellers \u2013 a company empowering women to travel solo \u2013 66% of female travellers mark safety as their top concern; a figure unchanged since 2020.\nThe company's index of more than 200 countries (based on current US/UK advisories, the current Global Peace Index and a survey ranking how solo women travellers viewed their risk while travelling) finds a few places consistently topping the list, including Spain, Australia, the Nordic countries, Thailand, the UK, Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia and Japan. Japan, which has one of the world's lowest crime rates, ranked number one for safety and stands out as a memorable destination for many solo female travellers.\u00a0\n\"Japan was by far the easiest country I have ever traveled in solo,\" said Georgia Fowkes, a travel expert at Altezza Travel. \"I felt this peculiar but wonderful mix of excitement and utter ease when I arrived in Tokyo. Whether in Shinjuku's buzzing chaos or Kyoto's quiet corners, the streets felt unbelievably safe, even at night.\"\u00a0\nShe found particular ease in women-only train cars and female-focussed capsule hotels. \"It all adds up to a place where you can truly let your guard down and soak it all in,\" she said.\nFiona Spinks, who writes the blog Following Fiona, echoes the survey's finding about how female travellers feel welcome in New Zealand. \"Here, it wasn't just about the views (although they're unreal). What stood out most was the people and the way travel in New Zealand often became a real community experience,\" she says. \"When I hiked through the Abel Tasman track, total strangers ended up sharing stories and food. Kiwis love chatting, and you'll gain so much insight from local conversations.\"\u00a0\nTo help support other women-owned businesses on their solo adventures Wanderful, a leading women's travel community, recently launched a map highlighting city guides around the world with women-owned shops, cafes and hotels.\n\"Maybe it's the wine, but I laugh more when I travel with women,\" said Kimberlee Lauer, a New Orleans-based senior account executive who travels frequently with her female friends. \"We can be spontaneous and silly together, and we find joy in our shared travel experiences, even when they go awry. I have travelled with my significant others in the past, but I don't really enjoy travelling with men nearly as much as my girlfriends!\"\nLGBTQ+ travellers\nIn light of sweeping new policies some LGBTQ+ travellers to the US may face extra challenges.\n\"Unfortunately, with transphobia, folks who don't perform gender standards are sometimes viewed with suspicion,\" said Lindsey Danis of the travel blog Queer Adventurers, where she recommends finding hotels with LGBTQ+-friendly policies.\nSpartacus World's 2025 Gay Travel index found Canada, Iceland, Malta, Portugal and Spain tied for LGBTQ+-friendliness \u2013 mirroring many of the safety indexes for women.\nValetta, Malta's capital, ranks particularly high on safety with a score of 99.8 on the World Travel Index. LGBTQ+ rights are enshrined in the Maltese constitution, and a large majority of the population supports same-sex marriage and equal rights.\nWhether a girls' getaway or a \"solo-but-not-alone\" trip, group travel built exclusively for women is skyrocketing. Nearly 14% of women are planning a women-only trip in 2025, according to Solo Female Travellers. The survey also found that 36% of women travelled solo on a small group trip, with 8% joining a trip with girlfriends. Road Scholar saw its enrollment in senior-focused women-only tours double in recent years.\u00a0\nMegan Vila, Innovation Manager for TourAxis, recommends women seek out smaller groups and female-led guides. \"Smaller group tours create a more intimate experience and offer a great way to form friendships with other travellers,\" she said. She also recommends itineraries that combine guided activities with plenty of free time. \"Women value expert guidance but also enjoy exploring at their own pace.\"\u00a0\nCruises have emerged as a holiday popular for women, whether already in a group or looking to make new friends. Uniworld recently launched their first women's-only river cruise departing in August 2025 throughout France.\n\"Group tours provide something like a tasting menu of different places, so I can see a bit of each city and decide for myself which ones I may want to come back to in the future. I can travel alone, but I'm not actually by myself,\" explained New York resident and frequent group traveller Jessie Parker. \"Get to know the other people in your tour group. There's an instant connection in your choosing the same trip at the same time, so be open to connecting with them as well, not just the location.\"\nNatural Habitat Adventures also expanded its women-only itineraries by 75% in 2025, noting that 30% of travellers are women travelling solo. The small, women-led group tours cover destinations like Greenland, Alaska and Costa Rica, focusing on wildlife viewing and highlighting women's history in each destination. Adventure travel continues to be a female-majority space \u2013 with women comprising 57% of all adventure travellers.\nWhile solo travel might have once conjured an image of a young, nomadic backpacker, The Woman Traveler Report by Skift recently busted that myth. Only 4% of adults aged 18-24 planned on embarking on solo trips, while nearly 25% of those aged 65 and above planned a similar journey.\nAccording to the report's findings, as women reach retirement age, they look forward to travelling to enjoy freedom and flexibility, escape their routines and challenge themselves. According to a 2023 study by Road Scholar, 85% of the operator's solo travellers are women, and 69% of their overall travellers are women. Barring health or mobility issues, many baby boomer women also set their sights on \"bucket list\" travel.\n\"With retirement came the precious gift of time, a treasure to be cherished; immersing myself in the moments that fill my heart and nourish my spirit,\" said Venida Hudley, who solo travelled to 12 African countries in 11 months and chronicled her adventures at Venida Discovers Africa. \"My passion was innovation, so I looked for out-of-the-box volunteer opportunities that fed my spirit like volunteering with an innovative fashion designer in Gaborone, Botswana, and volunteering with a business that creatively improves the environment like Gjenge Makers in Nairobi, Kenya.\"\u00a0\nA 2025 AARP report cited Europe as the most popular destination for international baby boomer travel, with Italy, Great Britain, France, Spain and Ireland in the top positions. At Scotland-based small-group tour company Rabbie's, seniors aged 60 and over receive discounted prices, and they've seen senior women most interested in \"set-jetting\", checking out the Downton Abbey Castle or Outlander filming locations in Scotland. \"The real-life history behind these famous locations is often just as captivating as the fictional storylines they have watched on screen,\u201d says Rabbie's CEO Hazel Rickett. \"Take Doune Castle, for example. Known to Outlander fans as Castle Leoch, it has centuries of its own stories to tell. Some driver-guides were even extras in the series, so they offer first-hand insights.\"\nAnother growing trend has been the emergence of cross-generational travel, driven in large part by millennials and Gen-Z parents who are including both their children and their own parents on their travels. According to American Express Travel's 2025 Global Travel Trends, 58% of millennials and Gen-Z parents plan to bring their extended family on trips in 2025, up from just more than 30% of Gen-X and baby boomers.\nFemale-focused tour operator Pink Girls Run the World sees a high percentage of its travellers embark as multigenerational trips. \"Plan experiences that can be shared across multiple generations, like afternoon teas,\" suggests founder Tashieka Brewer. \"Over Mother's Day weekend, we're planning a special multi-generational weekend in Bristol, Virginia and we're planning for a unique wine tasting experience at a local vineyard.\"\u00a0\nStephanie Webb of Seesight Tours echoes the sentiment. \"Some of my most meaningful trips have been with family. I took my mom to Italy, where she finally got to see the Amalfi Coast after dreaming about it for years,\" she said. \"Travelling across generations teaches you patience and appreciation. It's about slowing down, choosing activities that suit everyone's energy levels, and focusing on shared experiences rather than just checking off a bucket list. These trips remind me that travel isn't just about the places we see, but the moments we create together.\"\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

So Jon was almost the opposite, he's been quite slack about what the players can do both on and off the pitch.\n\"I think Edwards has the best of both. She has that balance of making sure players are accountable on and off the field, but also bringing in some fun and understanding that players are not robots. She can recognise the moments when they need that breathing space.\" \nWorld Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley also backed Edwards for the job and described her as a \"brilliant, outstanding coach\". \n\"She'll really get hold of this team and she'll know how to make the standards better so they can compete under pressure,\" Hartley said.\n\"She gives you free rein to work out things for yourself but doesn't take any nonsense and that is what England need right now.\"\nThe potential candidates are not as clear regarding England's next captain, though Nat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely option having been Knight's deputy with many, including both Greenway and Hartley, naming off-spinner Charlie Dean as a contender.\n\"It has been one of the biggest downfalls over the past five or six years that there isn't a standout candidate to take over,\" Hartley added.\n\"They need a coach who can get the culture right, control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room, and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

By one man. With a particular interest in stamps.\nDr Borthwick explains that \"panic\" first set in when a National Records of Scotland (NRS) employee attended an auction in London in 1994.\nThey discovered that 200 of the items up for sale belonged to NRS.\nThese should have been safely in Scotland's archives, not being offloaded to the highest bidder via a bang of the auctioneer's gavel.\nNRS can date back all their archive users to 1847. After some cross referencing, Dr Borthwick and his team realised that the auction items all linked back to one person \u2013 Prof David Stirling Macmillan.\nProf Macmillan was born in 1925 and was from Girvan, Ayrshire. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and studied history at the University of Glasgow.\nHis right to use the national archives had been revoked in 1980 when he was caught removing a document. Staff assumed this was a one-off.\nBut the truth was that Prof Macmillan had been helping himself since 1949.\nThe 200 items that turned up in the London auction were the tip of the iceberg.\nNow National Records of Scotland are revealing the scale of his thefts. And the odd nature of them.\nProf Macmillan wasn't pinching documents that were worth a lot of money, or even those that were particularly historically significant.\nThe archives include letters from Robert Burns and Mary Queen of Scots. But these weren't his targets.\nThe contents of many of the letters he took are mundane, perhaps even boring.\nBut a lifelong interest in stamps and postmarks seem to have led to him taking letters that caught his eye. Including documents dating back to 1637.\nOne example was a letter from a Scot who'd moved to the island of Madeira, off the north west coast of Africa. In 1813 they wrote to a friend with some news and gossip. Not exactly explosive stuff.\nAnd yet Prof Macmillan ripped it out of the book it was stored in and pocketed it.\nWe can't be certain about the motivations involved, but the interesting postmark and wax seal on the document are thought to be what tempted the professor.\nThe thief went to great lengths to cover his tracks.\nHe would remove reference numbers from documents and sometimes replace what he had taken with forgeries.\nIronically, Prof Macmillan was himself a professional archivist. He held that role at the University of Sydney and even placed an appeal for historical papers in the university newspaper.\nThe man who spent years stealing documents stressed they would be \"properly looked after\" and bemoaned the fact the so much of history had been \"destroyed or lost\".\nThe academic moved to Trent University in Canada in 1968 and spent 20 years teaching history, though he still seems to have made annual visits to Scotland's archives. He died in 1987, leaving no immediate family.\nMuch of his collection then found its way into the archives of Trent University, where they remained for some time. They were catalogued and descriptions were put online.\nIn 2012. Dr Alan Borthwick was still trying to track down what had been taken. He realised that thousands of the Trent University items rightly belonged to NRS and other UK institutions.\nDr Borthwick was dispatched to North America to investigate.\nHe says he was amazed by the \"sheer quantity of documents\" he found that had been stolen by Prof Macmillan.\nThe chief executive of NRS, Alison Byrne, echoes this. She described the scale of Prof Macmillan's thefts as \"unprecedented\".\nShe only took up her role six months ago, and was appalled when she was filled in on the situation.\nSecuring the return of these documents was one thing. But finding their rightful home was arguably the bigger task.\nFor decades, Dr Borthwick and his team have been \"piecing together the jigsaw\", undertaking the painstaking process of finding the correct place for all of these stolen items.\nFor context, National Records of Scotland are the custodians of 38 million documents. \nThey have 80 kilometres of shelving \u2013 enough to stretch from Edinburgh to Glasgow.\nTheir archives are all about precision \u2013 every document has an exact home that makes locating it straightforward.\nThe team wanted to get each item that Prof Macmillan had taken brought back to its rightful place.\nFortunately, NRS \"daybooks\" show what he was signing out of the archives. But his attempts to cover his tracks and remove identifying marks complicated the challenge.\nNow National Records of Scotland say they have got almost everything back where it should be, ready to be pored over by a new generation of historians.\nBut, for Dr Borthwick, how does it feel to know that a fellow archivist so egregiously abused the trust that was put in him?\nThe historian labels it \"a kick in the teeth\". He's been trying to undo the damage done by Prof Macmillan for almost all of his working life.\nThat time could have been spent on other historical projects.\nBut Dr Borthwick reflects that there's a \"sense of satisfaction\" in solving the mystery of the missing documents.\nDocuments that, these days, are kept under the watchful eye of CCTV.",

and what the Blues have proved time and time again in their dominance of domestic women's football.\nCuthbert's injury-time header completed a comeback 2-1 win at Etihad Stadium after a below-par first-half display left them a goal behind and in danger of a first Women's Super League loss this season.\nInstead they remain eight points clear in top spot - and on course for a sixth successive league title with five games left - after a second win in three titanic tussles with City over the past week.\n\"This is a team of champions - Chelsea found a way,\" ex-England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis told BBC One.\nA four-game mini-series, which first had Chelsea lifting the Women's League Cup, will conclude on Thursday at Stamford Bridge when the Blues try to overturn a 2-0 deficit from their Champions League quarter-final first leg at City.\nThat defeat ended their 31-game unbeaten run and, having bounced back impressively at City, Sonia Bompastor's side will remain convinced they can stay on course to win that elusive first Champions League trophy.\nBut will Chelsea fight back, or can City, under interim boss Nick Cushing, stay in control and triumph in the fourth meeting of the rivals in 13 days?\nBBC Sport takes a look at the intriguing battle so far.\nGame 1: Chelsea 2-1 Man City (Women's League Cup final)\nGame 2: Man City 2-0 Chelsea (Champions League quarter-final first leg)\nGame 3: Man City 1-2 Chelsea (Women's Super League)\nGame 4: Thursday, 27 March (Champions League quarter-final second leg)\nThis video can not be played\nChelsea come from behind to snatch win from Man City in injury time\nThe first part of this gripping story - the League Cup final - was decided by three scrappy goals, but Wednesday's outing at Joie Stadium was decided by two moments of quality from City substitute Vivianne Miedema.\nBack to form after returning from knee surgery in January, the Netherlands forward provided the ruthlessness which her side badly needed in the cup final defeat.\nWinger Kerolin was City's main attacking outlet for much of the European tie on Wednesday, causing problems down the right as she teed up Miedema's second.\nAnd the 25-year-old Brazilian opened the scoring in Sunday's game three in wonderful fashion, running from the halfway line and wrongfooting Millie Bright before squeezing a finish through the Chelsea captain's legs.\nBut her chances were limited in the second period as Chelsea forward Johanna Rytting Kaneryd made a greater impact at the other end, with her pace and trickery getting the better of Gracie Prior as she set up Chelsea's equaliser for striker Aggie Beever-Jones.\nCuthbert was influential when she came off the bench, piling pressure on City's midfield with determined tackles and intense pressing, before a diving header for the winner in added time.\nIt was a bold move from City to replace Gareth Taylor with former boss Cushing in the week of a cup final but, after Wednesday\u2019s Champions League victory, it seemed inspired.\nCushing won the WSL, Women's FA Cup and three League Cups in seven years at City before leaving in 2020 for MLS side New York City FC.\nAnd he has made an instant impact on his return, with his side dominating possession for large parts in all three games and looking solid defensively.\nThey have also impressed going forward - a major achievement considering top scorer Khadija Shaw and key winger Aoba Fujino have been sidelined by injury.\nFormer City midfielder Izzy Christiansen described 'game two' as a \"tactical masterclass\" from Cushing, with his substitutes after half-time - including Miedema -  making the difference.\nBut it was Bompastor's changes, and perhaps a motivational team talk, that saw them show up in the second half on Sunday to wipe out City's one-goal lead.\nBrown-Finnis said: \"They changed their tactical approach and moved Wieke Kaptein higher up, and then the players that came off the bench just showed the depth they have.\"\nBompastor said she reminded her players of the gameplan, adding: \"I told them I want to see more belief going into the second half.\"\nCity's efforts weren't helped by an injury to influential midfielder Yui Hasegawa, while Spain defender Leila Ouahabi started on the bench and keeper Ayaka Yamashita was replaced by Khiara Keating in the line-up with a problem expected to keep her out for a few weeks.\nMidfielder Laura Blindkilde Brown was also added to the list of long-term absentees, watching from the sidelines on crutches after an injury in training earlier this week, while keeper Aya \n\"I think you saw one team that was bringing their key players on, and one team that was having to take their key players off,\" reflected Cushing.\nThis video can not be played\nChelsea will have to be perfect -

        "article_text": "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?\nThat question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".\nIn October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.\nThe amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.\nThe SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.\nIt says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.\nBut the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.\nThis company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).\nThe key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.\nIt argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.\nAnd so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.\nThe Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.\n\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.\nRum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.\nMr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.\nThe SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.\nBoth the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.\nThe use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.\n\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"\nThis isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.\nThe second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.\nLastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.\nExamples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.\nAnother Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.\nBarbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.\nSimilarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.\nThe failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.\nBack in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.\nMr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.\nAnd while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.\nIn the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".\nIt concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

I want to do my best,\" Arroyo told BBC Sport. \n\"I am finding it frustrating because I want the players to be brave and it's not the best moment for them to be brave. \n\"It's good to talk about that because I am just as scared as they are. I don't want to be the manager of a relegated team.\n\"But the reality is a possibility if we don't do our jobs. We are in the same boat so we need to row harder, faster and stronger to make it. I really believe we will make it.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nThis video can not be played\nClinton scores \"ingenious\" long-range strike as Man Utd beat Aston Villa\nThe mood was low, belief seemed to disappear and fans were fearing the worst on another painful evening in Birmingham on Sunday.\n\"If you love to win, stand up,\" was the chant being sung by Manchester United fans towards the end of their ruthless 4-0 win at Villa Park.\nAnd even some Villa fans joined in.\nTheir side had struggled to create chances in a timid first half and were punished. They never found a way back into the game.\n\"I've really struggled to understand what Aston Villa are trying to do. The players look lost,\" said former England midfielder Izzy Christiansen on Sky Sports. \n\"I feel for the players right now and I don't want to be too harsh because I don't know what the root of the problems are. \n\"They're in this situation for a reason - the table doesn't lie. The manager has got to find the right words very carefully to motivate the team and get them on track, because it could end up being a slippery slope for the football club.\"\nJust before the full-time whistle went, manager Arroyo was crouched down in the dugout, perhaps pondering what to say to her players.\nShe jumped up afterwards and went over to each of them, giving them hugs and consoling handshakes.\nIn her pre-match programme notes, Arroyo admitted the squad was \"struggling\" and last week's defeat by Palace had knocked them.\n\"We're not getting the results that we all expect and not performing the way that we want,\" she added.\nIt is a feeling that will have only worsened on Sunday and you could sense the anxiety around Villa Park.\n\"Villa might actually get relegated,\" one security guard outside the press room blurted out afterwards.\nUnited led 3-0 by half-time thanks to a double from striker Elisabeth Terland and a long-range lob by Grace Clinton.\nVilla's evening got worse when Leah Galton added a fourth goal, and though substitute Ebony Salmon provided a threat, it was too late to make a dent.\nArroyo's side have only five matches to secure their safety in the WSL.\nAston Villa have lost their last six WSL games\nHow Villa have fallen so quickly is not clear.\nThey were being touted as a team who could break into the top four just 18 months ago - but now there are several factors that appear to have contributed to their downfall.\nSince former manager Carla Ward's resignation last season, they have struggled to find consistency, appointing Robert de Pauw before sacking him after six months.\nThat caused disruption in the January transfer window and Villa allowed big-name players Kenza Dali and Adriana Leon - who had grown unhappy - to leave in the hope of improving things in the dressing room. \nRecruitment has not entirely paid off. They spent money on club record signing Gabi Nunes, for example, but have still struggled to score goals.\n\"It's really surprising to see the downward spiral they have been on,\" former England defender Laura Bassett told BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\"I don't think the performances and the way they are competing has been bad but there's been individual mistakes and a lack of belief. \n\"They have not been clinical and not scoring goals so that can manifest psychologically, making it tough. \n\"We haven't seen that [new manager] bounce and I know a lot of players are out of contract at the end of the season too. In terms of management higher up, I'd be asking 'what is the direction?'\"\nWhat was most evident on Sunday was a growing sense of anxiety among Villa supporters.\nBut Arroyo says they can help the team fight for survival and she hopes to give them \"what they deserve\" by delivering results in the next five games.\n\"If you are not winning I cannot ask them to support us happily. I think they are trying their best,\" she said. \n\"I can only say 'thank you for coming' because we are not even able to score so I cannot ask them for anything. The only thing I can say is that we will work as hard as possible. \n\"I am pleased they understand we are struggling because with their support we will be stronger. We are not in the position we want, we are not in the position the club wants and we are not in the position the fans deserve. \n\"This is the reality. I'm sorry. If they can make the next game, hopefully they can celebrate with us.\"\nDespite the struggles, Arroyo still has belief.\nShe added: \"I see the players are committed and trying to learn. I am convinced we will make it.\"",

        "article_text": "Computers and smartphones might be where most writing is done these days, but typewriters still have work to do in the US.\nPretty much every day, another customer clutching an old typewriter will walk into Mike Marr's shop in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Marr carefully looks the machine over. Invariably, it will be a total mess. Made decades ago, the hunk of heavy metal bristling with moving parts is now laced with years of grime. The keys are too stiff. Or maybe the paper that's supposed to glide through it keeps getting stuck.\n\"Do you think you can get it going again?\" the customer will ask, a touch of anxiety in their voice. Marr, who has been repairing typewriters for more than 20 years, will say he'll give it his best shot.\n\"When they come in and pick that typewriter up, just seeing their smile is everything to us,\" he says. Even in the year 2025, a century and a half after the first commercially successful typewriter was introduced to the American public, surprising numbers of people in the US are still using these machines. And not just for fun \u2013 many of Marr's customers are businesses. \"We're still servicing probably 20 to 25 typewriters a week,\" he says. He employs three other people in his shop to keep up with the demand. \"Isn't that crazy?\"\nIn today's world, internet-connected computers and smartphones are king. They're used for the vast majority of business tasks and transactions. But here and there, in little offices and warehouses, you can still find a well-worn typewriter lingering in the corner. A machine whose keys have been pressed many thousands, if not millions, of times. To this day, typewriters print names on forms. They put addresses on envelopes. They fill out cheques. And the people who use them, generally speaking, have no intention of switching to a computer any time soon \u2013 at least for those particular tasks.\nIt was back in 1953 that Marr's grandfather founded the business he now runs: Marr Office Equipment. Decades ago, a call came through from IBM. The tech giant was looking for a new typewriter distributor in the northeast of the US. Marr's father and uncle, in charge at the time, were over the moon. \"That was the biggest thing that could ever happen to them,\" says Marr. \"Trailer trucks would just pull up and unload IBM after IBM. They'd already be sold. We couldn't keep up with it.\"\nMarr Office Equipment's heyday may be long gone but Marr still knows typewriter users all over his local area. He mentions one that is about a 10 minute drive away, in south Providence \u2013 a law firm named Tomasso & Tomasso, co-owned by brothers John and Ray, both attorneys. \"We sound exactly alike,\" says John, laughing as he introduces himself over the phone. Do they actually still rely on typewriters? Absolutely. \"There's not a day that goes by that we don't use them,\" says Tomasso. \"This is really still the best way.\"\nThe firm's office has three typewriters, John says and his colleagues still use them to type up cheques and fill in legal forms to ensure the details on those documents are legible. Plus, there's a security angle. It's very hard to hack a typewriter since they are not connected to the internet. In 2013, jaw-dropping details emerged about the extent of US intelligence agency surveillance programmes. This prompted the Russian Federal Guard Service (FSO) to revert to typewriters in an attempt to evade eavesdropping. German officials were also reported to be considering a similar move in 2014. (During the Cold War, Soviet spies actually developed techniques for snooping on electric typewriter activity, a form of \"keylogging\" technology \u2013 where the keystrokes inputted on a keyboard are captured. US operatives also reconstructed text from typewriter ribbons \u2013 meaning that even typewriters aren't completely safe.)\nI ask Tomasso whether there are downsides to using the typewriter \u2013 isn't it harder to correct mistakes? No, he replies, he has a model with an \"eraser ribbon\" that seamlessly covers up a mistype. Plus, the typewriters are inexpensive to run. Replacement ink ribbons cost around $5 (\u00a34), he estimates. Replacement printer ink cartridges can cost several times that.\nBesides, Tomasso loves to see his writing materialise instantly on the page in front of him. \"There's more of a sense of accomplishment than just letters that appear on a screen,\" he explains. \"It's one of those amazing devices that just makes our life better \u2013 I think that's the purpose of technology.\"\nFurther west, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a real estate agency called Jarvis Realty, owned and run by Woody Jarvis. \"I'm real old school,\" he says. Jarvis, too, regularly uses a typewriter for office work. He gives the example of putting together an offer of purchase for a client. It'll start on the computer but he'll then print the document out and, should he need to make any modifications, he prefers to use correction fluid and his typewriter rather than re-printing the contract and wasting a lot of paper. \"Our contracts are very legible and easy to understand,\" he says. He'll also occasionally type up a name and address on an envelope for a colleague. \"For me, it works because I know how to make it all work.\"\nTypewriters have had a long and colourful history. Centuries ago, tinkerers came up with early, experimental typing machines but they didn't really catch on. Then, in 1868, the first device actually called a typewriter emerged: the Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer, which was patented that year by four inventors in Milwaukee. One of the group, Christopher Latham Sholes, also invented the Qwerty keyboard. Without him, typing \u2013 even on computers \u2013 might be very different today. By the 20th Century, typewriters were everywhere. Millions of the machines were sold in the first few decades of the 1900s and by the mid-1980s, the typewriter industry was worth more than $1.1bn (\u00a3764m) in the US alone, according to press reports from the time.\nIn the 21st Century, typewriters have remained popular in certain corners of the world, despite the rise of computers. In India, for example, typewriters have found a flourishing market among enthusiasts and are still a common \u2013 albeit steadily vanishing \u2013 sight in courts and government offices.\nJarvis's cousin, Lisa Floading, who works at the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, is a big fan of typewriters. She has 62 of them. \"There's something very inviting about a typewriter waiting with paper in it,\" she explains. \"I have them all over my house.\"\nFloading uses a typewriter every day, she says, to make lists or write letters, and for office admin. \"There it is, you wrote three pages, boom, done. That's kind of lost on the laptop,\" she says. And she'll even bring a typewriter to her local coffee shop sometimes so she can work on it there. People regularly come up to her to ask about it, she says.\nIn June, Floading took part in an event in Milwaukee called Qwertyfest \u2013 intended to celebrate both the typewriter and the Qwerty keyboard layout, in memory of Christopher Latham Sholes. Among the attractions was a room full of typewriters where attendees could simply sit down and type. The sound of clacking keys and carriages returning filled the space. It was once a sound common in typing pools in businesses around the country.\nJim Riegert, now in his 70s, remembers what it used to be like. \"Back then, typewriters were pretty big. Typewriters and adding machines,\" he says, referring to desktop calculators. \"It got really difficult in the typewriter business about 25 years ago,\" he says. \"The internet was coming on and killing us, too.\" He runs Typewriters.com and, despite a decline in sales in recent decades, he still shifts four or five electric IBM typewriters every week. \"I just sold 12 to a prison that's putting them in the library because they don't let prisoners use computers,\" he says. Funeral homes, some of which use typewriters to compile death certificates, are also regular clients.\nRiegert's business is based in the city of Tucker, Georgia. His own office, inside a giant warehouse, is crammed witharound 70 or 80 IBM electric typewriters \u2013 second-hand units, which he services and sells. The build quality is top notch, he stresses. A prime model could set you back $749 (\u00a3594). When they were brand new in 1984 they would sell for around $1,000, but even accounting for inflation they have retained a surprising amount of value in the digital age.\u00a0 \"They're still the best typewriters you can buy,\" he says. These days, demand might be low \u2013 but somehow business remains steady, and profitable.\nIBM, nowadays arguably better known for supercomputers such as Watson, sold its typewriter business to Lexmark in the early 1990s. However, an IBM spokesperson says on very rare occasions, \"some people do ask for old manuals or service documents for typewriters, which we can provide if they're in the archives\". Lexmark, meanwhile, sold its last typewriter in 2002 and no longer has any typewriter-related services, though some of its former distributors still carry out maintenance on IBM Lexmark typewriters.\nIf, on the other hand, you want to buy a brand-new typewriter, that too remains possible. Many thousands are still manufactured every year. Todd Althoff is president of Royal, a US company that has been making typewriters since 1904. \"We're going to continue,\" he insists. \"Obviously [there is] not that much growth but it's sustainable and we keep the factory busy.\"\nThe factory is in Indonesia, he explains, and is run by a team from Nakajima, a typewriter manufacturing firm from Japan. Every year, Royal still sells around 20,000 new electric typewriters and more than double that amount of mechanical typewriters. The latter have become desirable partly as decoration \u2013 a librarian might buy one for a display at the front of their library, for instance, suggests Althoff. The mechanical and electric models Royal sells cost between $300 (\u00a3238) and $400 (\u00a3317).\nThankfully, there are still companies that make new typewriter ribbons, notes Paul Lundy, who runs Bremerton Office Machine Company, a typewriter repair business in Seattle. \"Those accessories are readily available,\" he says. \"As a person who repairs typewriters, that's always running at the back of my mind \u2013 why are businesses still using these things?\"\nBut he has some good examples, including workers in warehouses who must continually process the transfer of goods by filling out forms. It's hard to feed these complex forms into a computer printer so that information gets printed onto them in exactly the right places. So, says Lundy, the warehouse workers prefer to insert the form into a typewriter and type it up by sight instead.\nOver the years, he's noticed that some aging typewriter parts are becoming more fragile, in some cases possibly as a result of plastic fatigue. But overall, they remain \"incredibly durable\" machines, he says.\nAnd, best of all, when you sit down to use one, there are no distractions. You just type. One of Lundy's customers who appreciates this perhaps more than most is Anjali Banerjee, a novelist who lives in Seattle. She has published 15 books and she wrote the first drafts of the last three on a typewriter.\nSome years ago, Banerjee began getting increasingly frustrated when trying to type new material on her computer. Notifications kept popping up or her word processing software would repeatedly intervene on things like spelling and grammar. So she went out and bought a typewriter.\nBanerjee started with an electric model but then got interested in mechanical versions. Now, she claims that her first drafts emerge more fluidly when she sits down at a typewriter rather than a screen. \"I have to keep moving forward. The story moves faster, if that makes sense,\" she says. \"You have to put it out there, like clay.\" The further editing \u2013 or shaping of the clay \u2013 takes place after she scans the typewriter-produced drafts into her computer.\nBanerjee goes on to admit candidly: \"I developed what we call 'typewriter fever'.\"\nFollowing her first typewriter purchase in 2019, she built up an astonishing collection of no fewer than 120 machines. However, she has recently slimmed this down to about 80 typewriters and plans to sell off roughly half of those. In essence, it became an epic search to find her perfect typewriter. And Banerjee has definitely discovered some personal favourites, such as her Olivetti Studio 45, an Italian-made model. The author, who also plays piano, compares typing on a typewriter to playing a tune on the instrument. It's percussive. And it requires more effort from your hands and fingers than a computer keyboard. She has sought out typewriters that are just right \u2013 not too stiff, not too loose. But a good, deep \"throw\" (the depth of key press required) is satisfying, she adds.\nTypewriters engage the senses, says Banerjee. You hear the energetic clack-clack-clack of the keys as you work away. You might even detect the musty aroma of old offices or maybe long-faded cigarettes. In that atmosphere of industry distilled, you focus in on what you're doing. \"I lose time,\" she says. She'll look up and two hours may have gone by. Her thoughts are right there on the pages in front of her.\nAs long as there are writers like Banerjee, and office workers who prize well-practised convenience over modernity, typewriters will never be completely obsolete, it seems.\nThat ought to keep Mike Marr busy, at his shop in Rhode Island. \"I was born and bred to repair typewriters and office equipment,\" he says. \"It's all I know in life.\"\nMany of the ailing machines that customers bring to him are fundamentally in good condition, merely requiring a clean and a re-oiling of their moving parts. A smattering of decades-old grease in the machine's tightest nooks and crannies has simply dried up. But that's an easy fix. The typewriter itself is perfectly fine \u2013 and it has plenty more work to do.\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Patients are taking part in a trial that scientists hope could ultimately lead to a cure for rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe AuToDeCRA-2 study seeks to prove it is possible to train white blood cell commanders - dubbed the \"generals\" of the immune system - to order other \"soldier\" cells to stop attacking healthy tissues.\nProf John Isaacs, who has worked on the condition for 35 years and is leading the research, believes this could make it possible to \"switch off\" rheumatoid arthritis.\nTrial participant Carol Robson, from Jarrow in South Tyneside, says the worst part of living with the disease is the pain, but if the research helps ease suffering \"that would be wonderful\".\nThe study, funded by the charity Versus Arthritis and the European Commission, is being run by Newcastle University and Newcastle Hospitals.\n\"It's pioneering,\" Prof Isaacs claims. \"There are only one or two other groups around the world doing similar work.\"\n\nIn this latest research, now in its second phase, certain cells are isolated from a patient's blood.\nProf Isaacs explained there are different types of cells that come together, rather like an army of soldiers, to attack an infection or disease.\nThese take instructions from the white blood cells known as dendritic cells, which he refers to as the \"generals\" of the immune system.\nWhen these generals sense danger they become excited and send out the attack signal, but when there is no danger detected they remain calm and instruct the army to ignore healthy tissues. \nWhen this goes wrong it causes diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.\nOver the course of a week the patient's white blood cells are grown in the lab and trained to resemble the \"calm\" generals so that, when given back to the patient, they command the soldiers to stop attacking the patient's joints.\n\"In time, this treatment could provide significant benefits to people living with rheumatoid arthritis by 'switching off' the disease,\" Prof Isaacs explains.\nAmong the estimated 450,000 people in England who live with the condition is 70-year-old former nurse Ms Robson. She wakes up every morning to pain.\nBefore she was diagnosed she would put her hands in packets of frozen peas in an effort to find some relief.\nShe now takes immunosuppressants, which she says help a bit, but since being injected with the retrained white blood cells she believes she is in less pain.\n\"Is this just me hoping it is?

Born to Greek parents in Genk, Karetsas joined their academy and quickly accelerated through the ranks to make his first-team debut at the end of last season as a 16-year-old substitute against Cercle Brugge. He started for the first time in a win over Royal Antwerp two weeks later.\nThis season, he has been a first-team regular, starting 14 and coming on in another 11 games, mainly as an attacking midfielder and helping Genk to the top of the Jupiler Pro League.\nKaretsas represented Belgium at youth level, playing for their under-21s as recently as November.\nBut, as Greek journalist Stephen Kountourou explained on BBC Scotland's Daily Football Podcast, there was a wrangle going on behind the scenes.\n\"We had to fight tooth and nail with the Belgian FA to stop him representing them and that was seen as a big coup for Greek football, because Karetsas is rated not just as a potentially decent talented player but as one of the big players for the future in international football,\" he said.\nFor Karetsas, whose idols include Neymar and Ronaldinho, there seemed to be little doubt as to whom he would represent at senior level.\n\"My heart beats only for Greece - my homeland fulfils me completely,\" he was quoted as saying.\nHe was warmly welcomed into the fold by the Greek fans on Thursday and his performance was so impressive BBC Scotland's co-commentator James McFadden fully expects him to start at Hampden.\n\"I thought he looked really classy, composed, willing to take people on and, when he came on, he was their main outlet,\" he said. \"They were just desperate to get the ball to him, so I think he comes straight into the team.\"\nPat Nevin, working at the game for BBC Radio Scotland and Five Live, was similarly impressed.\n\"I thought he made a huge difference, probably the main reason the game changed massively in the second half,\" the former Scotland winger added.\n\"Chatting to Steve Clarke afterwards, he agreed the young lad is pretty special and somebody that needs to be kept a really close eye on.\"\nKaretsas himself clearly does not lack confidence.\n\"Already, I feel like I belong in the national team. I'm really happy I made the decision to be here,\" he said afterwards.\n\"I was up against Andy Robertson. He is a very good player, but when I go one on one, I don't see who's in front of me.\n\"We lost, but we played well in the second half and that is how we have to play on Sunday in Scotland. I think, if we play like that, we will win.\"\nTrying to ensure that does not happen will be Craig Gordon, who acknowledged the threat his young adversary posed.\n\"He looked fantastic when he came on,\" said the Hearts goalkeeper. \"He's someone we'll need to look out for in the second leg.\n\"I haven't seen many debuts like that from someone so young. It was an impressive first cap for him, but thankfully we managed to keep him out.\n\"We'll see what Sunday brings and he might get more minutes at Hampden. But I'm sure we'll have a plan to deal with that as well.\"\nMcFadden does not believe head coach Clarke will adapt his gameplan to deal with the teenager.\n\"I think you respect the fact he's a very good player, but it's Andy Robertson that's going to be playing against him,\" McFadden said. \n\"I think if you said to him, 'I'm going to get someone to help you with this young player', I don't think he'd be too happy.\"\nNevin added: \"I think he'll consider it, because if you don't consider it and he has a great game, you've made a mistake.\n\"I think it's more, don't change your entire attitude but be very aware, if it starts being a problem, you can adapt to it.\"",

        "article_text": "Saira Baloch was 15 when she stepped into a morgue for the first time.\nAll she heard in the dimly-lit room were sobs, whispered prayers and shuffling feet. The first body she saw was a man who appeared to have been tortured. \nHis eyes were missing, his teeth had been pulled out and there were burn marks on his chest.\n\"I couldn't look at the other bodies. I walked out,\" she recalled.\nBut she was relieved. It wasn't her brother - a police officer who had been missing for nearly a year since he was arrested in 2018 in a counter-terrorism operation in Balochistan, one of Pakistan's most restive regions.\nInside the morgue, others continued their desperate search, scanning rows of unclaimed corpses. Saira would soon adopt this grim routine, revisiting one morgue after another. They were all the same: tube lights flickering, the air thick with the stench of decay and antiseptic.\nOn every visit, she hoped she would not find what she was looking for - seven years on, she still hasn't. \nActivists say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared by Pakistan's security forces in the last two decades - allegedly detained without due legal process, or abducted, tortured and killed in operations against a decades-old separatist insurgency. \nThe Pakistan government denies the allegations, insisting that many of the missing have joined separatist groups or fled the country.\nSome return after years, traumatised and broken - but many never come back. Others are found in unmarked graves that have appeared across Balochistan, their bodies so disfigured they cannot be identified.\nAnd then there are the women across generations whose lives are being defined by waiting. \nYoung and old, they take part in protests, their faces lined with grief, holding up fading photographs of men no longer in their lives. When the BBC met them at their homes, they offered us black tea - Sulemani chai - in chipped cups as they spoke in voices worn down by sorrow. \nMany of them insist their fathers, brothers and sons are innocent and have been targeted for speaking out against state policies or were taken as a form of collective punishment.\nSaira is one of them. \nShe says she started going to protests after asking the police and pleading with politicians yielded no answers about her brother's whereabouts.\nMuhammad Asif Baloch was arrested in August 2018 along with 10 others in Nushki, a city along the border with Afghanistan. His family found out when they saw him on TV the next day, looking scared and dishevelled. \nAuthorities said the men were \"terrorists fleeing to Afghanistan\". Muhammad's family said he was having a picnic with friends.\nSaira says Muhammad was her \"best friend\", funny and always cheerful - \"My mother worries that she's forgetting his smile.\" \nThe day he went missing, Saira had aced a school exam and was excited to tell her brother, her \"biggest supporter\". Muhammad had encouraged her to attend universty in Quetta, the provincial capital. \n\"I didn't know back then that the first time I'd go to Quetta, it would be for a protest demanding his release,\" Saira says.  \nThree of the men who were detained along with her brother were released in 2021, but they have not spoken about what happened.\nMuhammad never came home.\nThe journey into Balochistan, in Pakistan's south-west, feels like you are stepping into another world. \nIt is vast - covering about 44% of the country, the largest of Pakistan's provinces - and the land is rich with gas, coal, copper and gold. It stretches along the Arabian Sea, across the water from places like Dubai, which has risen from the sands into glittering, monied skyscrapers.\nBut Balochistan remains stuck in time. Access to many parts is restricted for security reasons and foreign journalists are often denied access. \nIt's also difficult to travel around. The roads are long and lonely, cutting through barren hills and desert. As the infrastructure thins out the further you travel, roads are replaced by dirt tracks created by the few vehicles that pass. \nElectricity is sporadic, water even scarcer. Schools and hospitals are dismal.\nIn the markets, men sit outside mud shops waiting for customers who rarely come. Boys, who elsewhere in Pakistan may dream of a career, only talk of escape: fleeing to Karachi, to the Gulf, to anywhere that offers a way out of this slow suffocation.\nBalochistan became a part of Pakistan in 1948, in the upheaval that followed the partition of British India - and in spite of opposition from some influential tribal leaders, who sought an independent state. \nSome of the resistance turned militant and, over the years, it has been stoked by accusations that Pakistan has exploited the resource-rich region without investing in its development.\nMilitant groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), designated a terrorist group by Pakistan and other nations, have intensified their attacks: bombings, assassinations and ambushes against security forces have become more frequent.\nEarlier this month, the BLA hijacked a train in Bolan Pass, seizing hundreds of passengers. They demanded the release of missing people in Balochistan in return for freeing hostages. \nThe siege lasted over 30 hours. According to authorities, 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed. But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.\nThe disappearances in the province are widely believed to be part of Islamabad's strategy to crush the insurgency - but also to suppress dissent, weaken nationalist sentiment and support for an independent Balochistan.\nMany of the missing are suspected members or sympathisers of Baloch nationalist groups that demand more autonomy or independence. But a significant number are ordinary people with no known political affiliations.\nBalochistan's Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti told the BBC that enforced disappearances are an issue but dismissed the idea that they were happening on a large scale as \"systematic propaganda\".\n\"Every child in Balochistan has been made to hear 'missing persons, missing persons'. But who will determine who disappeared whom? \n\"Self-disappearances exist too. How can I prove if someone was taken by intelligence agencies, police, FC, or anyone else or me or you?\"\nPakistan's military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif recently said in a press conference that the \"state is solving the issue of missing persons in a systematic manner\". \nHe repeated the official statistic often shared by the government - of the more than 2,900 cases of enforced disappearances reported from Balochistan since 2011, 80% had been resolved. \nActivists put the figure higher - at around 7,000 \u2013 but there is no single reliable source of data and no way to verify either side's claims.\nWomen like Jannat Bibi refuse to accept the official number. \nShe continues to search for her son, Nazar Muhammad, who she claims was taken in 2012 while eating breakfast at a hotel. \n\"I went everywhere looking for him. I even went to Islamabad,\" she says. \"All I got were beatings and rejection.\"\nThe 70-year-old lives in a small mud house on the outskirts of Quetta, not far from a symbolic graveyard dedicated to the missing.\nJannat, who runs a tiny shop selling biscuits and milk cartons, often can't afford the bus fare to attend protests demanding information about the missing. But she borrows what she can so she can keep going.\n\"Silence is not an option,\" she says.\nMost of these men - including those whose families we spoke to - disappeared after 2006.\nThat was the year a key Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, was killed in a military operation, leading to a rise in anti-state protests and armed insurgent activities. \nThe government cracked down in response - enforced disappearances increased, as did the number of bodies found on the streets.\nIn 2014, mass graves of missing people were discovered in Tootak \u2013 a small town near the city of Khuzdar, where Saira lives, 275km (170 miles) south of Quetta. \nThe bodies were disfigured beyond identification. The images from Tootak shook the country - but the horror was no stranger to people in Balochistan.\nMahrang Baloch's father, a famous nationalist leader who fought for Baloch rights, had disappeared in early 2009. Abdul Gaffar Langove had worked for the Pakistani government but left the job to advocate for what he believed would be a safer Balochistan.\nThree years later Mahrang received a phone call that his body had been found in Lasbela district in the south of the province.\n\"When my father's body arrived, he was wearing the same clothes, now torn. He had been badly tortured,\" she says. For five years, she had nightmares about his final days. She visited his grave \"to convince myself that he was no longer alive and that he was not being tortured\". \nShe hugged his grave \"hoping to feel him, but it didn't happen\". \nWhen he was arrested, Mahrang used to write him letters -  \"lots of letters and I would draw greeting cards and send them to him on Eid\". But he returned the cards, saying his prison cell was no place for such \"beautiful\" cards. He wanted her to keep them at home. \n\"I still miss his hugs,\" she says. \nAfter her father's death, Mahrang says, her family's world \"collapsed\".\nAnd then in 2017,  her brother was picked up by security forces, according to the family, and detained for nearly three months.  \n\"It was terrifying. I made my mother believe that what happened to my father wouldn't happen to my brother. But it did,\" Mahrang says. \"I was scared of looking at my phone, because it might be news of my brother's body being found somewhere.\"\nShe says her mother and she found strength in each other: \"Our tiny house was our safest place, where we would sometimes sit and cry for hours. But outside, we were two strong women who couldn't be crushed.\"\nIt was then that Mahrang decided to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Today, the 32-year-old leads the protest movement despite death threats, legal cases and travel bans.\n\"We want the right to live on our own land without persecution. We want our resources, our rights. We want this rule of fear and violence to end.\"\nMahrang warns that enforced disappearances fuel more resistance, rather than silence it.\n\"They think dumping bodies will end this. But how can anyone forget losing their loved one this way? No human can endure this.\"\nShe demands institutional reforms, ensuring that no mother has to send her child away in fear. \"We don't want our children growing up in protest camps. Is that too much to ask?\"\nMahrang was arrested on Saturday morning, a few weeks after her interview with the BBC.\nShe was leading a protest in Quetta after 13 unclaimed bodies - feared to be missing persons - were buried in the city. Authorities claimed they were militants killed after the Bolan Pass train hijacking, though this could not be independently verified.\nEarlier Mahrang had said: \"I could be arrested anytime. But I don't fear it. This is nothing new for us.\"\nAnd even as she fights for the future she wants, a new generation is already on the streets.\nMasooma, 10, clutches her school bag tightly as she weaves through the crowd of protesters, her eyes scanning every face, searching for one that looks like her father's.\n\"Once, I saw a man and thought he was my father. I ran to him and then realised he was someone else,\" she says.\n\"Everyone's father comes home after work. I have never found mine.\"\nMasooma was just three months old when security forces allegedly took her father away during a late-night raid in Quetta. \nHer mother was told he would return in a few hours. He never did.\nToday, Masooma spends more time at protests than in the classroom. Her father's photograph is always with her, tucked safely in her school bag.\nBefore every lesson begins, she takes it out and looks at it.\n\"I always wonder if my father will come home today.\"\nShe stands outside the protest camp, chanting slogans with the others, her small frame lost in the crowd of grieving families.\nAs the protest comes to an end she sits cross-legged on a thin mat in a quiet corner. The noise of slogans and traffic fades as she pulls out her folded letters - letters she has written but could never send.\nHer fingers tremble as she smooths out the creases, and in a fumbling, uncertain voice, she begins to read them.\n\"Dear Baba Jan, when will you come back? Whenever I eat or drink water, I miss you. Baba, where are you? I miss you so much. I am alone. Without you, I cannot sleep. I just want to meet you and see your face.\"",

He's just got to keep playing well for Arsenal and in the senior team with England.\n\"But what I would say is you've got be careful with these young players - they're special and they're precious and you have to take your time sometimes.\"\nDespite the rapid rise, it hasn't all been plain sailing for the young full-back.\nHe has twice been sent off - in the win over Wolves in January and the home defeat by West Ham in February - although the first of those red cards was later rescinded on appeal.\nDebutants Dan Burn and Lewis-Skelly pose for a photograph after the win against Albania\nFormer Arsenal centre-back Per Mertesacker is now the club's academy manager and has known Lewis-Skelly since he was part of the under-12 squad, having first joined the Gunners aged nine.\nThe Islington-born youngster's rise is even more impressive when you consider left-back is not even his natural position.\nHe came through the academy as a central midfielder - but has gone from strength to strength in an 'inverted' full-back role.\n\"I don't think there's a particular moment where you see that he would have a good chance to make it to the first team,\" said Mertesacker earlier this year.\n\"I knew Myles from when he was an under-12 and going to youth tournaments with all the ups and downs. Sometimes you win and everyone is excited - and sometimes you lose and you start crying.\n\"It's just about understanding where everyone is on their journey.\n\"With Myles, whatever challenges we put in front of him he seems to be really comfortable and ready.\n\"That's probably for me his main trait.

The Red Roses started in clinical fashion, the returning Claudia MacDonald scoring the bonus-point try inside 30 minutes.\nBut the second half was more of a struggle for England, who came up against a much-improved Italy and were limited to Emma Sing's try in the closing minutes.\n\"It's a really good start. We had new combinations and built really good pressure,\" Mitchell told BBC Sport.\n\"What let the pressure off was a little bit of [lack of] urgency to the breakdown and then execution was probably the only thing that let us down in terms of building pressure in the second half.\n\"We wanted to build pressure and we have got started with that, but Italy threw a few punches at us as well and we had to deal with that.\n\"If we don't get punches, how do you learn to get better?

She looked a threat from her first touch, with her sharp footwork and lethal speed opening the scoring with a well-deserved try.\nCreating a dual playmaker system by shifting Holly Aitchison to inside centre and starting versatile back Helena Rowland at fly-half was another new combination which helped England get an advantage in the wider channels in the first 40 minutes.\nDebutant GB Sevens player Jade Shekells brought a physical presence off the bench to bounce off multiple Italian defenders, while replacement scrum-half Flo Robinson, through various snipes, also looked bright on her first cap.\n\"One of the challenges John's got is giving debuts and giving game time to young players, but trying to create synergy in the side,\" former England head coach Simon Middleton told BBC Sport.\n\"There were lots of changes and it's really hard to get cohesion.\"\nMitchell - Middleton's successor - believes it is likely to be during the middle of the tournament when England will start clicking \"connection-wise\".\nMaggie Alphonsi, a 2014 World Cup winner with England, added: \"John's thinking about the end [the World Cup] in mind. He's got to accept that there are going to be errors and there are learnings from it. We also knew that they weren't going to be perfect today.\n\"The key thing is about making sure they develop that cohesion and build those combinations.\n\"It's about peaking at the right time.

        "article_text": "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".\n\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.\nIts owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are \"the vital underbelly of everything\". \n\"It's where people find themselves,\" he says. \"It's where people find their tribe.\"\nMr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the \"rave generation\", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years. \nAnd according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are \"dropping like flies\".\nIn the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.\nIn London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.\n\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.\nThere are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices. \nBut the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did\nAnd if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?\nFor several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.\nA recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.\nPsychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".\nA YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.\nDr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"\nThere is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.\nWhen lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"\nOf course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".\nThis rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.\nBut Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\" \nThere might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".\n\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"\n\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".\nNot everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".\nEntry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.\nIn an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.\n\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"\nMr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.\nIf clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.\nIn 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.\nRussell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".\nThe company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.\nThe Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.\nBut its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.\nThe Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".\nThere are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success. \nGut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.\nCo-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"\nThen there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.\n\"It's about safety of members,\" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance. \nUltimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs. \n\"For some people it's almost the only place they've got where they can go and feel a sense of belonging and real community,\" he says.\nCat Rossi has spent years researching the creative significance of nightclubs, in her capacity as a design historian and professor of architecture at University for the Creative Arts Canterbury. \"Since the dawn of civilisation we've needed to go out and dance and be together at night,\" she says. \"Social gathering is a core part of our social fabric.\n\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"\nMany fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.\n\nIn 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.\nThe following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.\nIt is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"\nAnd the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg. \n\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"\nBut without that transformation, the UK risks losing more of them.\n\nAdditional reporting by: Laura Lea, Fran Whyte and Harriet Whitehead \nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "There are six regular-season rounds of the Premiership remaining with Jamie Benson (centre) and Will Muir (right) eyeing the play-offs with Harlequins and Bath, while Henry Pollock's Northampton look to be out of the running\nAfter an eight-week hiatus for the Six Nations, the Premiership returned with a roar this weekend, as a slate of derby matches delivered big names, big scores and big shifts in the race for the play-offs.\nFord landed six of his seven kicks at goal, as well as laying on two of Sale's tries in their win over Newcastle\nGeorge Ford does not want to rest. \nThe 32-year-old had played only 93 minutes of rugby in 2025 before Sale's meeting with Newcastle.\nHe has spent a whole lot longer holding tackle shields for England, with Marcus Smith and Fin Smith restricting him to only a second-half cameo against Wales during the Six Nations.\nFord came on at the Principality Stadium and produced some touches of 24-carat quality, setting up a pair of tries, the first with a bullwhip mispass and the second with a disguised inside pop.\nThere was plenty more for his highlight reel at Kingston Park. Ford snapped an inch-perfect cross-kick for Joe Carpenter to score out wide after putting Tom O'Flaherty in with blurringly quick hands.\nAfterwards, Sale boss Alex Sanderson was talking up Ford's potentially last shot at British and Irish Lions selection.\n\"If George plays like that in the next seven games, it would be very hard not to pick him,\" said Sanderson.\n\"You learn best from your peers and particularly in a Lions squad where you've got to bring people together, George is a brilliant character at doing that.\n\"He helps me out all the time with that. There are loads of factors that lead into him being a good option for the Lions.\"\nDoing it against Newcastle and Wales \u2013 both bottom of their tables \u2013 is one thing. \nHowever, if Ford can produce similar magic away to Toulouse in the Champions Cup on 6 April, then Lions coach Andy Farrell, who has known Ford since he was a boy, will find his case even harder to resist.\nPlayer of the match Benson also made 51 metres with ball in hand after coming on early in the second half\n4,739 days.\nHarlequins' wait for an away win over London rivals Saracens has been a long one, going back to March 2012 and a showpiece game under the Wembley arch.\nIn the shining surrounds of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, it seemed like Quins' losing streak at the neighbours might stretch even longer.\nSaracens, who included England captains past and present Maro Itoje and Jamie George, among a host of internationals in their line-up, led 12-0 at half-time.\nBut unheralded 22-year-old fly-half Jamie Benson, making only his fourth Premiership appearance, stole the show by the end, steering Quins home via five out of five successful kicks off the tee.\nHaving played for England Under-20s alongside Quins team-mates Fin Baxter and Chandler Cunningham-South, Benson's progress has been slowed by his completing a Natural Sciences degree at Cambridge University.\nDuring his time as a student he has also played in three Varsity Matches, a fixture which in its 1980s heyday featured future internationals Rob Andrew and Stuart Barnes facing off at fly-half.\nCould Benson revive that tradition?\nMeanwhile, Saracens are in danger of breaking their own tradition.\nYou have to go back 16 seasons to find one, unaffected by their 2020 points deduction and subsequent relegation, in which they have failed to make the Premiership play-offs.\nCurrently seventh, they play Leicester, Gloucester and Sale, all above them in the table, in their next three matches.\nBath made fewer metres, fewer line breaks and beat less defenders with ball in hand, but still managed to subdue local rivals Gloucester\n\"We'll just have to do it next year now.\"\nAt the end of last year's Premiership final, Finn Russell made a vow to head coach Johann van Graan that Bath would return and go one better than their defeat by Northampton.\nThey certainly are going the right way about it.\nEleven points clear of third, they surged on towards a home semi-final with a 42-26 win over Gloucester, in which flanker Guy Pepper was superb.\nIt wasn't as comfortable as that scoreline might suggest. After an hour, Bath's lead was just two points.\nFor that they had Will Muir to thank. The wing had produced an extraordinary charge-down of Santi Carreras' first-half conversion, flying off the line to block from bang in front.\nIt was an act that summed up the hunger of a team that has won eight of their past nine matches.\nJack Bates, who scored three of Bristol's eight tries against Exeter, joined the club as a 14-year-old\nEngland coach Steve Borthwick has said that the Premiership's stand-and-deliver slugfests are not ideal preparation for tighter Test rugby.\nHe could probably ignore much of Bristol's 52-38 win over Exeter. It was hard for anyone else to take their eyes off it though.\nThe first 18 minutes alone featured seven tries.\nBristol conceding a score before centre Benhard Janse van Rensburg caught Harry Byrne's restart and cantered straight in at the other end summed up a madcap opening.\nThe impressive Josh Hodge showed deft footwork to control the ball on the bounce before scorching in for the visitors.\nFeaturing 64 points, it was the highest-scoring first half in Premiership history. And it was always likely to happen at Ashton Gate.\nNo team has scored more tries than Bristol this season. But only one \u2013 Newcastle \u2013 has conceded more.\nAll a bit 'defence optional' as the critics say.\nBristol number eight Viliame Mata might beg to differ though.

The offensive to retake the capital began in earnest on 26 September when the army launched air strikes against RSF-held areas in Khartoum.Then in January, the beginning of the dry season saw fresh pushes by the army - bolstered by a new alliance with Islamists and ethnic militias - leading to a string of strategic victories.We've identified video and photographs from key moments in the retaking of the city.25 January - Breaking out of siege The army headquarters in central Khartoum had been encircled by RSF forces for 21 months, trapping soldiers unable to link up with other army units closing in on the city.Then in late January, following military advances further north, the army was able to send reinforcements to break through RSF lines and end the siege.Verified social media footage posted on 25 January shows soldiers celebrating in the grounds of the army HQ.Soldiers celebrate at the army HQThe following day, the army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, visited the army HQ saying his forces would \"eradicate\" the RSF and pursue them to the corners of the country.6 February - Blocking RSF escape route Many RSF fighters attempted to withdraw across the White Nile River to safer areas on the western side as pressure mounted on their positions.They found their escape route blocked following a reported air strike by the SAF on the main bridge across the river.Footage posted on 6 February shows this crossing point at Jebel Awliya dam about 40 km south of Khartoum, blocked by badly damaged vehicles, with black smoke visible in the distance.Burnt vehicles on the bridge across the Jebel Awliya damBBC Verify has been able to confirm the location of this footage using satellite imagery which also shows black smoke rising at that location on the bridge.3 March - Taking control of a key bridgeArmy forces approaching Khartoum attempted to take control of the Manshiya Bridge, the last major crossing under RSF control.On 3 March, the SAF posted drone footage from the battle for control of the bridge. In it we can see the army targeting RSF vehicles and fighters trying to flee.  A truck, carrying some men, and others running alongside, can  be seen going up in flames as it is hit on the bridge.RSF vehicles targeted on the Manshiya bridgeFurther drone footage shows more than a dozen men scampering through shrubs towards the bridge.In the following days the army was able to hold its position at the bridge and to close in on the remaining RSF fighters trapped in the area.16 March - Closing in on central Khartoum BBC Verify has identified dramatic footage, posted on 16 March, of what appears to be an RSF fighter caught in an army ambush as they flee the SAF advance towards the city centre.Along a tarmac street, a speeding motorcycle comes under a hail of bullets and suddenly flips over throwing off its rider.The men firing - identifiable as belonging to the army from their uniform and yellow headbands - can be heard in the footage congratulating themselves following the attack.An ambush on RSF fighters By matching the buildings and the trees we see in the videos to satellite imagery, we have established the incident took place at a location about 2 km (1.2 miles) south of the presidential palace.20 March - Taking the presidential palace We've identified video of the army striking a convoy of vehicles travelling along al-Qasr Avenue, moving away from the palace, posted online early on the morning of 20 March.The footage shows a huge fire erupting, with multiple explosions and projectiles emerging from within the fire, suggesting the detonation of munitions being carried on the vehicles.The video is accompanied by voices, speaking in Arabic, describing the attack on the RSF convoy vehicles containing weaponry.Fires erupt after an attack on an RSF convoyWe have managed to establish the location from two buildings seen in the footage which match buildings we see on Google Maps at a junction just over 1km from the presidential palace.Just a few hours later, jubilant Sudan army soldiers posed for pictures in front of the palace building, their arms raised in victory.The RSF still hold control over significant parts of the city as well as large areas of western Sudan.  But the taking of the palace by the army is hugely symbolic moment in the conflict.Additional reporting by Kumar Malhotra, Richard Irvine-Brown, Benedict Garman and Matt Murphy",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

There was no communication from them until 11:00 and even this it was only that they could take us back on Monday, which would involve an eight hour stay at Heathrow.\n \"If you didn't want the flight you had to phone a number that took forever to get through, but I suspect it was a minor inconvenience compared to some.\"\nLess fortunate was Liz Steele, who missed her youngest son Paddy's graduation in Stirling on Friday.\nShe told BBC News: \"It was devastating. \n\"I know that there are people that have been affected much worse than this, but I've been to every other graduation that my kids have had, Masters and undergrads, and I just always thought that I would be there.\"\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye denied the incident - caused by a transformer catching fire within the North Hyde electrical substation - had made the airport a \"laughing stock\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"We have other substations but to switch them in takes time.\n\"The situation was not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences.\" \nA spokesperson for British Airways said around 85% of its services would be able to fly today.\nOn social media Heathrow Airport advised all passengers to check flights in advance before travelling.",

More money has already been allocated to defence by reducing the aid budget.\n\"We can't tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That's not available in the world we live in today,\" she said.\nIn her autumn Budget, Reeves increased the levels of tax and public spending significantly \u2013 paid for largely through extra taxes on businesses which proved highly controversial.\nBut she is now under pressure on several fronts. It emerged on Friday that government borrowing \u2013 the difference between its spending and its income from taxes \u2013 was even higher than expected in February.\nThe official prediction for that month from the Office for Budget Responsibility was \u00a36.5 billion, but it hit \u00a310.7bn, leaving the chancellor with less fiscal headroom. \nAdding to the Treasury's in-tray, official growth forecasts for the economy are also likely to be cut.\nLast week, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030 and creating a more \"pro-work system\", though ministers have not set out the breakdown of forecast savings.\nThe changes will affect people claiming disability and health benefits, as well as those aged under 22 relying on top-up payments while on universal credit.\nThe chancellor will set out the impact of these changes in more detail in her Spring Statement, and is expected to announce further cuts \u2013 this time to some Whitehall departments \u2013 to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy.\nThe Treasury has reiterated that these rules \u2013 to not borrow for funding day-to-day public spending and to get debt falling as a share of the UK economy by 2029-30 - are \"non-negotiable\" .\n\"What I've done so far is put money into public services,\" Reeves insisted in her BBC interview.\nShe said there was \"real growth\" in spending for each of the next few years \"but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly\".\nBut Labour grandee Lord Blunkett wants Reeves to \"loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", calling them \"Treasury orthodoxy and monetarism at its worst\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster on Saturday, the former work and pensions secretary under Tony Blair said he would \"raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15bn\" to help fund \"a new deal for the unemployed, getting half a million of those young people who are out of work and training into a job or a training programme\".\nReeves spoke to me earlier this week amid unease among Labour MPs at the welfare changes.\nIn the interview, she opened up on how the job is going so far following a number of controversies not only over her decisions, but also over the accuracy of parts of her CV.\nAsked whether she had been treated fairly, and in the same way as her male predecessors, Reeves told me: \"I think that would be up to others to judge and people to judge over time.\n\"I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers' money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people is properly scrutinised. That's part of the job.\n\"One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed over these last 14 or so years, is some of the personal criticism because that's not the sort of politics that I do.\"\nResponding to Reeves' comments on the economy, shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"The Labour chancellor promised 'growth, growth, growth' but since the Budget, growth is down, inflation is up, and business confidence has collapsed.\n\"Labour are having to come forward with an emergency Budget on Wednesday - a situation entirely of their own making.\n\"Rachel Reeves must urgently rethink her anti-business Budget.\"",

Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.\nThese White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.\nThat an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.\nAnd that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.\n\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.\nDemocratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.\n\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.\nCriticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.\nDon Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"\nWith Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.\n\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"\nTrump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.\nThe White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \nBy Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.\nIn its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.\nJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.\nWhile the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.\nHe noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"\nThe vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".\n\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\nThis is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.\nDick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.\nThis is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.\nLike this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.\nTheir revelation also proved to be political damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.\n\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.\nOn Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Mark Carney, former two-time central banker, was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister earlier this month, after being elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. \nOn Sunday, he called a snap election. \nSeveral political leaders had called for a vote after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was resigning as leader of the Liberals in January.\nBut after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on the country, sparking a trade war, calls have grown for Canada to go to the polls as soon as possible.\nWith the snap election call, Carney is sending Canadians the polls in a matter of weeks. \nThe election will be held on Monday 28 April. \nBy law, the maximum time between federal elections in Canada is five years. The next vote was officially scheduled for 20 October 2025. \nHowever, there are a couple of scenarios in which an early election can be triggered: \nThe first scenario is what Carney did on Sunday. \nIn the Canadian federal election - as in the UK's general election - voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister. \nInstead, the leader of the party with the majority of members of parliament (MPs) becomes PM. \nThat means Carney will be in the running, along with Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, and Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party. \nFour main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois. \nThe Liberal Party has been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. At dissolution, it held 153 seats. \nThe Conservatives were the official opposition with 120 seats. \nThe Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, had 33 seats, and the NDP had 24. \nThe Green Party held two seats.\nDuring the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead. \nBut the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down. \nFollowing Trump's decision to introduce steep tariffs against Canada, they tightened further, suggesting a neck-and-neck race. \nWhen Trudeau resigned at the beginning of 2025, he did so under significant pressure from his own party. It was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the Liberals' hopes of winning the next election.\nNational polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), suggest how support for the Liberals weakened throughout 2023 and 2024.\nAt the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January 2025 - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%.\nSince then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that 37.5% of Canadians back the Liberals, while 37.1% support the Conservatives. \nThis marks the first time in three years the Liberals are leading in the polls, according to the CBC. \nHow to respond to President Trump's economic threats has overtaken the cost of living as the dominant issue for voters.\nThere are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons. \nAll the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election.\nMembers of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election.\nLike the UK, Canada has a \"first-past-the-post\" electoral system. \nThe candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area.\nThe leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs normally forms the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition. \nIf no party ends up with an overall majority of seats, the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government. \nPractically, it means the party with the most seats will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties.\nTo vote in a Canadian election you must:",

So Jon was almost the opposite, he's been quite slack about what the players can do both on and off the pitch.\n\"I think Edwards has the best of both. She has that balance of making sure players are accountable on and off the field, but also bringing in some fun and understanding that players are not robots. She can recognise the moments when they need that breathing space.\" \nWorld Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley also backed Edwards for the job and described her as a \"brilliant, outstanding coach\". \n\"She'll really get hold of this team and she'll know how to make the standards better so they can compete under pressure,\" Hartley said.\n\"She gives you free rein to work out things for yourself but doesn't take any nonsense and that is what England need right now.\"\nThe potential candidates are not as clear regarding England's next captain, though Nat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely option having been Knight's deputy with many, including both Greenway and Hartley, naming off-spinner Charlie Dean as a contender.\n\"It has been one of the biggest downfalls over the past five or six years that there isn't a standout candidate to take over,\" Hartley added.\n\"They need a coach who can get the culture right, control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room, and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

I am sorry, it's my decision, and I accept that decision,\" said Crisafulli.\nThe government had toyed with plans to redevelop the Gabba - which was built in 1895 and has staged 67 men's Test matches - but those plans were scrapped following a 100-day review into planning for 2032.\nCricket, which is being held in Los Angeles in 2028 and is likely to be retained in 2032, could be played at the Gabba before the arena is torn down. \n\"Wouldn't it be amazing to see the Australian cricket team win gold at an Olympic final? The Gabba's swansong,\" Crisafulli said. \n\"The Gabba is at its end of life. It hasn't been well maintained, and we do need a stadium to host this great show, and there is an opportunity for legacy play.\"\nQueensland Cricket backed the plans, with chief executive Terry Svenson saying the arena had been a \"wonderful venue\" but its challenges were \"well documented\". \nA new 25,000-seater national aquatic centre will be built in Spring Hill near the main stadium, while a new 20,000-seater arena is planned near the main athletes village. \nThe rowing will be held in Queensland's Fitzroy River, which is known to host saltwater crocodiles but the government says the waters are safe.\n\"If it's good enough for central Queensland kids, I reckon it's good enough for Pierre from Paris,\" said Crisafulli. \nThe Brisbane Queensland Tennis Centre will receive significant upgrades in order to host tennis events. \nThe Gabba first staged a Test match in 1931 \nSpeaking to BBC World Service, ABC reporter Arianna Levy said the plans to build a stadium in Victoria Park are controversial because the site holds \"cultural significance\" to aboriginal people. \n\"It really has come as a political backflip.\" said Levy on Tuesday.\n\"It's been really polarising for a lot of the community here in Queensland.\n\"The main stadium in Victoria Park, which will host 63,000 seats, it's one of the few green sites across Brisbane and it holds cultural significance to the indigenous people of Brisbane, the Turrbal people. They call the place the Barrambin. \n\"It was a native camping ground and food-gathering place. It had First Nations people from across Queensland gather all over the place for corroboree, which is the traditional dance for First Nations people. \n\"There were protests today. There were communities that were against the development of the park to turn it into a stadium. We do imagine in the days to come there will be fallout from community groups and stakeholders that feel like this plan is not the best plan going forward.\"\n",

        "article_text": "A promising footballer from south London says being told he would never be able to play the sport he loves again was \"one of the hardest things to deal with mentally\".\nCollin Skhoyimue was signed to a League One club's academy just before his 14th birthday and two months into his contract, he was selected to play a match above his age grade. \nBut that was short-lived as he suffered an injury to the cartilage in his knee during the game and was subsequently released. \nEight years on, Collin, now 21, says it was like \"somebody taking his dream away\".\nIt's a familiar story. There are an estimated 1.5 million players playing organised youth football in England at any one time - but only around 180 of those will make it as a Premier League professional.\nCollin's love for football started when he was five years old.\n\"I remember I used to fold up socks into a ball and put it on the floor and play,\" he says.\nHe would make football goals on both sides of his house using his mum's shoes and, as the only player, would try to score for both teams.\nWhen he got signed for the League One football club in December 2017, he went home to surprise his mum Sylvia.\nCollin says it was \"a good feeling that the hard work paid off\" and he \"proved the haters wrong\", referring to the people in his school who had  doubts about him and called him names.\nLeague One is the third tier of professional football in England, below the Premier League and the Championship. \n\"Collin is a very passionate boy, once he gets it in his mind 'I'm going to do this', he's so determined and he'll go for it and get it done,\" his mum says.\nCollin was one of three young boys who were chosen to go on trial for the football academy out of 300 trialists, which he describes as \"a dream\". He says he used his six-week summer holiday to prepare for the initial open trial.\nTwo months after being signed, the footballer was given the opportunity to play for the under-15s, despite being in the under-14 squad at the time.\nDuring this match, he was passing the ball from defence and was injured when his knee collided with an opponent's knee during a tackle.\n\"After that, my football career turned into a nightmare,\" the 21-year-old says.\nDespite doing rehab with his academy for six months, Collin decided to get a scan with the NHS, where doctors diagnosed him with a congenital discoid meniscus and told him he would need surgery on his knee. \nHe was then put on the NHS waiting list and nine months later had the operation.\nSix months afterwards, Collin's team was about to enter the under-16 season.\nHowever, the academy manager who initially signed him for the club had left the team, meaning the new coach had not seen him play and he was released.\n\"One of the hardest things about that is not that I got released because of my ability or if I'm always late to training... but the reason I got released was out of my hands so there was genuinely nothing I could have done to avoid myself from getting released,\" Collin says.\n\"Football is a business,\" he adds. \"Once you're playing and you're well, everyone loves you - but when you're on the sidelines and you're not playing and no longer useful, they'll just throw you out.\n\"As a footballer, you're just an asset and I think the earlier you realise that, the better.\"\nDespite the surgery, Collin's problems with his knee continued and he underwent another operation. Six months later, a scan revealed that the issue had not been solved.\nCollin says his surgeon then told him: \"You've now had two surgeries... the issue has not been solved and you will never ever be able to play football again.\"\nThose last 10 words were \"one of the most heartbreaking experiences\", says Collin. \nHe adds he did not go into school for a week because \"his dream was over\". \nDespite not playing football for four years, Collin did not give up hope for the game he loved.\nHaving finally made a recovery to his knee, he made his first appearance back on the pitch in August 2022, despite doctors saying he would never play again.\n\"That was one of the best days of my life,\" he says.\nHe then developed a love for coaching, began managing an under-7s team and started his own coaching business to \"be that person that [he] needed when [he] was younger\".\nAfter being signed to a new football team and playing for one year for the full-time National League, Collin suffered another injury to his other knee and has been in recovery since December 2023.\nHe now hosts a series on social media called Injured 2 Pro where he shares his journey. \nCollin hopes to use his story to inspire and motivate people around the world.\n\"I've been through a lot and when you've been through a lot you have a lot to give so I feel like I have a lot to give back,\" he says.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHighlights: Price on target as Northern Ireland draw at home to Switzerland\nMuch has been made of the youthful nature of Michael O'Neill's new generation Northern Ireland side.\nSo youthful, in fact, that the average age of the team that finished the game was only 22. \nBut that was just a figure, and at Windsor Park against Switzerland on Friday you could not tell who the battle-hardened, major tournament experts were, and who were the fearless youngsters.\nAfter earning promotion from Nations League C, this was billed as a step up for Northern Ireland against a pot one team.\nWhile Switzerland were without a win in seven matches, they were Euro 2024 quarter-finalists, only knocked out on penalties by England. \nIsaac Price's latest moment of magic gave the hosts the lead, but the Swiss soon levelled through a header from the unmarked Vincent Sierro. \nThey have a reputation as one of Europe's most consistent and efficient sides, but there was not a gulf in class in Belfast. \nIn fact, it was Northern Ireland who could have won the match as Price, Lee Bonis, Ethan Gabraith and debutant Jamie Donley all had efforts to find a winner.\n\"It was good, it was what we wanted from the game,\" said a satisfied O'Neill.\n\"We scored a goal goal but, we're disappointed with the goal that we lost.\n\"If you look at the age of our team, against a really strong team - yes, they are missing some important players, but so are we.\n\"I think it shows a lot of progress in the team. We weren't overawed by the opposition.\"\nPrice on target as Northern Ireland draw with Switzerland\n'Lots of positives' in Switzerland draw - O'Neill\nO'Neill was pleased with the work from his side off the ball, as they allowed Switzerland to dominate possession but chances for the visitors were few and far between.\nAfter a difficult Euro 2024 campaign, in which an injury-ridden NI fell short of qualification, O'Neill's side have now lost just twice in 11 matches - one of which was to European champions Spain and the other a narrow defeat on a heavy pitch in Bulgaria.\nFriday's draw shows that things are moving in the right direction ahead of the start of 2026 World Cup qualifying in September.\nFor O'Neill, continuing that momentum is key.\n\"The cycle for Euro 2024 was a difficult one, we were never going to be able to compensate for the players we lost,\" O'Neill added.\n\"We didn't have players ready made to come in. We're probably benefiting from that now because we had to play the younger players in that point in time. \n\"There is momentum and it's good for the players, because when they started to play international football, maybe they weren't winning a lot of games. \n\"It's not like they are coming from the culture of, 'Oh, we're used to winning', so to give them that and get that experience at international level is vital. \n\"We have a really good group of lads - how they work as a group and what they are like around the hotel, it's a really easy group to manage and I think they have a lot of growing still to do.\" \nWhile Isaac Price, who O'Neill says is a \"brilliant young player\", stole the headlines after another superb goal, Northern Ireland's player of the night was arguably Ethan Galbraith, who continues to grow in stature every time he pulls on the green shirt. \nThe Leyton Orient midfielder also caught the eye of O'Neill, who said the 23-year-old produced \"a really good performance\".\n\"He's another player who looks really comfortable playing international football,\" O'Neill added.\n\"Technically he's so good as well. I always hoped Ethan would come through and I'm delighted that he has.\"\nWhen on the books of Manchester United, it was almost assumed it was a case of when not if Galbraith would play for Northern Ireland's senior team.\nHowever, after electing to drop down the leagues upon leaving Old Trafford, Galbraith has taken the long road to the international stage and O'Neill feels it was worth the wait. \n\"Ethan was a terrific young player, and it's a difficult situation to come through and be a player at Manchester United. \n\"He's had to go back down the leagues and I think Leyton Orient and [manager] Richie Wellens has been brilliant for him.\" \nEthan Galbraith was impressive in Northern Ireland's midfield and even had a spell at right-back\nO'Neill added that \"everyone knew the talent was there\" with Galbraith, who also had a spell at Doncaster Rovers.\n\"It sometimes just takes a little bit longer for it to fall into place. \n\"His mentality is a lot stronger now, his physical attributes are stronger - but his ability on the ball was never in question.\" \nAfter Friday's solid performance, Northern Ireland will be tested again in Stockholm against Sweden on Tuesday evening, who are on a resurgent run after dropping into League C.\nO'Neill admits he does not have the depth to \"change the side dramatically and expect the team to be just as strong\", but says he will likely freshen things up.\n\"Sweden are a good side. I'm not sure whether [Newcastle United striker Alexander] Isak will play and I believe [Sporting Lisbon's Victor] Gyokeres is out, but they have good players and it will be a test for us.  \n\"The players should gain confidence from tonight's game and take that into Tuesday.\"",

        "article_text": "A mother in northern Nigeria is visibly upset as she clutches her two-year-old child, who has burns and discoloured skin on his face and legs.\nThe 32-year-old used skin-whitening products on all six of her children, under pressure from her family, with results that she now deeply regrets.\nFatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.\nAnother was left with darker skin than before - with a pale circle around her eyes, while a third has whitish scars on her lips and knees.\nHer toddler still has weeping wounds - his skin is taking a long time to heal.\n\"My sister gave birth to light-skinned children but my children are darker skinned. I noticed that my mother favours my sister's children over mine due to their skin tone and it hurt my feelings a lot,\" Fatima says.\nShe says she used creams she bought at her local supermarket in the city of Kano, without a doctor's prescription.\nAt first it seemed to work. The grandmother warmed towards Fatima's children, who were aged between two and 16 at the time. \nBut then the burns and scars appeared.\nSkin-whitening or lightening, also known as bleaching in Nigeria, is used in different parts of the world for cosmetic reasons, though these often have deep cultural roots.\nWomen in Nigeria use skin-whitening products more than in any other African country - 77% use them regularly, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO). \nIn Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.\nThe creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription. \nOther ingredients sometimes used are the poisonous metal, mercury, and kojic acid - a by-product from the manufacture of the Japanese alcoholic drink, sake.\nDermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.\nThe skin may become thinner, with the result that wounds take longer to heal, and are more likely to become infected, the WHO says.\nThe situation is so bad that Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) declared a state of emergency in 2023.\nIt is also becoming more common for women to bleach their children, like Fatima did.\n\"A lot of people link light skin to beauty or wealth. Women tend to shield, as they call it, their children from that discrimination by bleaching them from childbirth,\" Zainab Bashir Yau, the owner of a dermatology clinic in the capital, Abuja, tells the BBC.\nShe estimates that 80% of the women she has met have bleached their children, or plan to do so.\nSome were bleached themselves as babies, she says, so are just continuing the practice.\nOne of the most common ways to tell whether someone is using skin-whitening products in Nigeria is by the darkness of their knuckles. Other parts of people's hands or feet get lighter, but knuckles tend to remain dark.\nHowever, smokers and drug users also sometimes have dark patches on their hands, due to the smoke.\nSo users of skin-lightening products are sometimes mistakenly assumed to belong to this group.\nFatima says that is what happened to her daughters, aged 16 and 14.\n\"They faced discrimination from society - they all point fingers at them and call them drug addicts. This has affected them a lot,\" she says.\nThey have both lost potential fianc\u00e9s because men do not want to be associated with women who might be thought to take drugs.\nI visited a popular market in Kano, where people who call themselves \"mixologists\" create skin-whitening creams from scratch.\nThe market has a whole row of shops where thousands of these creams are sold. \nSome pre-mixed varieties are arranged on shelves, but customers can also select raw ingredients and ask for the cream to be mixed in front of them.\nI noticed that many bleaching creams, with labels saying they were for babies, contained regulated substances.\nOther sellers admitted using regulated ingredients such as kojic acid, hydroquinone and a powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which may cause rashes and other side-effects.\nI also witnessed teenage girls buying bleaching creams for themselves and in bulk so that they could sell them to their peers.\nOne woman, who had discoloured hands, insisted that a seller add a lightening agent to a cream that was being mixed for her children, even though it was a regulated substance for adults and illegal to use on children.\n\"Even though my hands are discoloured, I am here to buy creams for my kids so they can be light-skinned. I believe my hands are this way just because I used the wrong one. Nothing will happen to my children,\" she said.\nOne seller said most of his customers were buying creams to make their babies \"glow\", or to look \"radiant and shiny\".\nMost seemed to be unaware of the approved dosages.\nOne salesman said he used \"a lot of kojic\" - well over the prescribed limit - if someone wanted light skin and a smaller quantity if they wanted a subtler change.\nThe approved dosage of kojic acid in creams in Nigeria is 1%, according to Nafdac.\nI even saw salesmen giving women injections.\nDr Leonard Omokpariola, a director at Nafdac, says attempts are being made to educate people about the risks.\nHe also says markets are being raided, and there are efforts to seize skin-lightening ingredients at Nigeria's borders as they are brought into the country.\nBut he says it was sometimes hard for law-enforcement officials to identify these substances.\n\"Some of them are just being transported in unlabelled containers, so if you do not take them to the labs for evaluation, you can't tell what is inside.\"\nFatima says her actions will haunt her forever, especially if her children's scars do not fade.\n\"When I confided in my mum about what I did, due to her behaviour, and when she heard the dangers of the cream and what stigma her grandchildren are facing, she was sad that they had to go through that and apologised,\" she says.\nFatima is determined to help other parents avoid making the same mistake.\n\"Even though I have stopped... the side-effects are still here, I beg other parents to use my situation as an example.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "As an asteroid mining start-up's latest mission goes awry, Josh Sims looks at how close we really are to extracting rare minerals from the many celestial bodies above us.\nThirty years ago the seminal BBC science programme Tomorrow's World made a few predictions about how the world might be by 2025. It was a testament to how hard predicting the technological future is: we would, the programme suggested, have microchip implants to help us deal with ATMs, chat with holographic helpmates in our homes and there would be riots over internet access.\nThe episode\u00a0also suggested we would be mining asteroids\u00a0by now. And while we aren't there yet, it's something that some start-ups argue will happen sooner than many imagined.\nThe founder of the California-based company\u00a0AstroForge\u00a0believes it will be the first to get there, and the company has already taken the first tentative steps. On 27 February 2025 it\u00a0launched its first\u00a0$6.5m (\u00a35.1m) unmanned spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Around nine days later, AstroForge believes the spacecraft \u2013\u00a0named Odin \u2013 likely passed beyond the Moon and into deep space as planned.\nUnfortunately, however, AstroForge developed major communications problems with Odin, which it is still trying to rectify at the time of writing. The firm hopes Odin has now entered its nine-month long coast to its mission destination: a fly-by of the carefully pre-selected asteroid 2022 OB5, some eight million km (five million miles) from Earth, which Odin will assess the composition of using its sensors.\n\"Move fast and break rocks\" might be the mantra of Matt Gialich, AstroForge's ebullient founder with a penchant for swear words, who is not dissuaded by the perhaps unresolvable technical trouble. AstroForge expected nothing less than many hurdles and has, he says, learned much even if contact isn't made with this spacecraft again. \"Yes, there are a lot more baby steps to take,\" he concedes. \"But we're going to start to actually do it. You have to try.\"\nFollowing a further launch next year, the company plans to develop ways to mine near-Earth asteroids for the valuable, concentrated metals some contain \u2013 particularly the platinum-group metals essential to much of our fuel cell and renewable technology. Scientists have highlighted that these are increasingly costly to mine on Earth \u2013 financially, environmentally, socially and even geopolitically.\nBut others question whether mining these metals in space and bringing them back to Earth is really feasible, especially in the near term \u2013 and whether it could have its own unique, but just as impactful, environmental costs.\nGialich hopes that over subsequent test launches over the next decade, AstroForge will recover small quantities of metal \u2013 initially a few grams, working up to kilograms as its programme advances \u2013 from target asteroids of a few metres to half a kilometre in diameter. Early hauls would likely not be commercial but, Gialich says, depending on the metals extracted, could take them on the way to commercialisation. Just one kilogram of rhodium, for example, is\u00a0currently priced at\u00a0$183,000 (\u00a3141,000).\nIt certainly sounds optimistic. But Victor Vescovo \u2013 one of the firm's main investors and the explorer who built a submersible that in 2019 made him\u00a0the first person to visit the bottom of all five oceans\u00a0\u2013 feels that the technical challenges are \"just a question of developing the tools\".\n\"Bring back a few micrograms to show it can be done and then scaling the process up is relatively straightforward,\" he says. \"To fully realise asteroid mining may be a multi-decade project. But it's just a mathematical problem.\" While it's no doubt a major engineering feat to pull off, he adds, taking samples of material direct from asteroids has already been done by state space agencies, including Japan's\u00a0Jaxa with Hayabusa 1\u00a0and\u00a02\u00a0back in 2005 and 2014, and NASA with its\u00a0Osiris-Rex mission\u00a0in 2020.\nAnd if the idea of mining asteroid seems outlandish, Vescovo argues, many technological breakthroughs \u2013\u00a0the Wright brothers' first manned flight, for example\u00a0\u2013 have likewise carried the same burden. Until, that is, they actually happen.\nIan Lange, associate professor at the Colorado School of Mines, an engineering research institution with a space resource programme, stresses that we can currently only estimate the technological hurdles of asteroid mining. A spacecraft rendezvousing with an asteroid may be only marginally more complicated than doing so with another spacecraft, he notes. But how, for example, might resources be extracted without the stabilising force of gravity?\n\"Mining \u2013 separating ore from dirt \u2013 is relatively straightforward, but then some kind of chemical or heat process, and gravity, is required to separate what we want from what we don't,\" Lange says. \"Reproducing that in space is going to be much harder. At this stage it's hard to say whether [established] techniques can be employed or whether [the asteroid mining industry] will have to develop entirely new ones.\"\nThe idea of asteroid mining was largely the stuff of academic interest until the 1980s, when Nasa began to formulate ideas of just how space resources might be gathered, says Lange. These ideas gathered pace with growing environmental concerns during the 1990s, he adds. Indeed, since then several private companies the likes of Moon Express, Planetary Resources or Deep Space Industries struggled against the high development costs. By the end of the 2010s, the latter two were acquired and directed towards other projects. Small wonder Lange believes the combination of business and technological challenges means that asteroid mining is still another 30 years away.\nThe real game-changer, argues Vescovo, has been the technological pace of change over the last 10 years. New observatories, such as the nearly complete Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile, will soon offer better tracking of asteroids. Optics and spectrographic analysis are affording easier identification of those that look to be candidates for mining \u2013 even if quite how many of these there are remains open to debate. Powerful computing has become more widely available. And there are more, and more affordable, off-the-shelf components with which spacecraft can be built.\n\"It wasn't long ago that only governments could do this kind of thing or had access to the technology, and they never used it with much efficiency,\" says Joel Sercel, founder of TransAstra, a Los-Angeles-based company developing various technologies for the fledgling asteroid mining sector. TransAstra will be running a demonstration of its inflatable \"capture bag\" tech for the collection of orbital debris on the International Space Station later this year. \"Now we have a vibrant private space business that's going to make asteroid mining happen vastly sooner than people predict.\"\nThe most crucial development for asteroid mining is that it has become far easier and cheaper than ever to get a payload into orbit, due to the privatisation of the space industry and its development of reusable rockets.\n\"We've gone from it costing $10,000 (\u00a37,850) to put 1lb (450g) into space 15 years ago, to a few thousand now,\" says Vescovo. \"And with the likes of Space X's Starship the prospect of it costing hundreds of dollars in the near future.\"\nThe astrophysicist and science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson has said that the first trillionaire will come through asteroid mining, \"I do hope he's not wrong,\" laughs Vescovo. Either way, he believes asteroid mining will prove essential to stop metal mining's ongoing despoliation of the Earth.\nLange, however, is sceptical of AstroForge's plans: yes, asteroid mining will likely prove technologically possible, he reckons, but he is much less certain about Astroforge's platinum group-focussed business model. \"While Earth remains rich in [these resources], even if at the bottom of the sea, that still means a tonne of possibilities [to attain them] that are certainly easier than collecting them from space,\" he says. \"If, that is, we allow ourselves to take them.\"\nBut Kathryn Miller, an environmental scientist at the University of Lancaster argues that asteroid mining could make for an environmentally more attractive option than, say,\u00a0deep-sea mining\u00a0\u2013 the still theoretical but\u00a0soon to be regulated\u00a0proposal to scrape the seabed for resources. While terrestrial mining is also \"[not] exactly good\u2026given the habitat destruction, the social justice issues and so on\u2026 gathering the nodules of cobalt and copper from the seafloor isn't just a matter of removing the substrate, but destroying the seabed,\" Miller says.\nOf course, getting rockets into space and back is\u00a0highly polluting and energy intensive\u00a0but then so is mining. A 2018 study from researchers at the University of Paris\u2013Saclay compared\u00a0mining platinum on Earth to a\u00a0projection\u00a0of mining it from asteroids. The researchers estimated that 150kg of CO2 would be emitted into the Earth's atmosphere for each kilogram of platinum mined from an asteroid. Producing 1kg of platinum on Earth using current practices, meanwhile, generates 40,000kg. This is essentially down to their\u00a0rarity on Earth: the Earth's upper crust is only 0.0005 parts per million platinum, with even the most productive mines currently operating at around five to 15 parts per million.\nDaynan Crull, the founder of asteroid mining company Karman+, thinks the future of asteroid mining lies more realistically in the search for resources to build an economy\u00a0in\u00a0space. The\u00a0World Economic Forum predicts\u00a0the space economy will be worth a staggering $1.8 trillion (\u00a31.4 trillion) by 2035.\nMining in space could shift the balance of power between often developing nations naturally rich in minerals and developed ones able to harness the technology required to harvest them in space, argues Deganit Paikowsky, a scholar at George Washington University Space Policy Institute who researches the politics of space mining. Deganit is wary of the potential disruption to the status quo that asteroid mining might bring.\n\"It's one thing to mine resources in space for use in space\u00a0\u2013 look at the leading space-faring nations now and they're more about creating an enduring human presence in space, so exploiting materials to that end is logical,\" she says. \"But it's another thing to bring those resources back to Earth for use in an [established] Earth economy. That's going to impact many different stakeholders in many ways.\"\nWhen it comes to asteroid mining, says Crull, the headline grabbers tend to be platinum group metals, along with other resources that might be mined, such as rare earths and the helium-3 required for nuclear fusion. But, he says, consider mining of water for its life-sustaining oxygen and rocket propellant hydrogen, or of clay for the 3D printing of ceramics that can be used to make, say, space habitats or solar collectors. Mining would circumvent much of the costs of getting these into space from Earth entirely.\n\"We looked at bringing asteroid resources back to Earth but the feasibility and economics seem fuzzy to us,\" says Crull. Instead, Karman+ is looking to mine resources in space to then be used in space, for making space habitats or in the maintenance of satellites, for example. Karman+ has recently raised $20m (\u00a315.4m) institutional investment and has a launch for its first spacecraft \u2013 to test sampling capabilities \u2013 booked for February 2027.\nIt still leaves many unanswered questions. Is this just swapping one kind of environmental damage for another? Some have expressed concern about the creation of space tailings \u2013 the rubble left over from asteroids once they're mined. They worry about the problem of how to dispose of this waste and, like other space debris, that it otherwise might eventually fall to Earth. Scientists such as Monica Grady, a professor of planetary and space sciences at The Open University in the UK, have argued that space's pristine environment should not be tarnished, with humans instead learning \"to clean up as we go along\".\nGialich, however, argues that the resources in space should instead be viewed as a way to protect those on Earth. \"There's infinite space out there and countless asteroids but only one Earth,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 What does spending a long time in space do to the human body?\n\u2022 Where did asteroid 2024 YR4 come from?\n\u2022 The satellites that will skim the sky\nThere's one more question that needs answered, though, before we start buying asteroid resources mined by these companies here Earth: are they really theirs to sell? That is some way off being decided, says Rosanna Deplano, a professor of international space law at the University of Leicester in the UK and an advisor to the Asteroid Mining Corporation, a London-based space mining company.\nThe 1967 Outer Space Treaty, the oldest but most widely ratified agreement on international space law \u2013 signed by 115 countries \u2013 says we should treat space as a commons but makes no reference to its resources. \"So that implies [mining is] not forbidden,\" says Deplano.\nThe 1979 Moon Agreement, meanwhile, says that the Moon's natural resources shouldn't become anyone's property \u2013 but that has only been ratified by seven states, including Chile, the Netherlands and Morocco, and none of which to date have their own manned spaceflight programmes. A United Nations special committee is set to convene in 2027 to discuss the utilisation of space resources, but any pronouncement won't be legally-binding.\nIndeed, as indicated by discussions between the US and Ukraine on a potential deal over Ukraine's mineral resources, it may be that national interests could take precedence. \"If the extraction from asteroids is for scientific research I don't think it will be terribly problematic,\" says Deplano. \"But the problem arises on the political level when it's commercial.\"\nCountries are already giving interpretations on this issue from their own national perspectives, she adds. \"That's only incentivising commercialisation. It's going to happen.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, Xand Instagram.\u00a0",

This is essentially down to their\u00a0rarity on Earth: the Earth's upper crust is only 0.0005 parts per million platinum, with even the most productive mines currently operating at around five to 15 parts per million.Daynan Crull, the founder of asteroid mining company Karman+, thinks the future of asteroid mining lies more realistically in the search for resources to build an economy\u00a0in\u00a0space. Mining would circumvent much of the costs of getting these into space from Earth entirely. But the problem arises on the political level when it's commercial \u2013 Rosanna DeplanoMining in space could shift the balance of power between often developing nations naturally rich in minerals and developed ones able to harness the technology required to harvest them in space, argues Deganit Paikowsky, a scholar at George Washington University Space Policy Institute who researches the politics of space mining.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump revoked security clearances from his previously defeated Democratic election rivals, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, as well as a number of other former officials and critics.\nTrump said in February he was revoking security clearance for his predecessor Joe Biden. His order confirmed that decision, adding that he was also revoking the security clearance of \"any other member\" of the Biden family. \n\"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump's memorandum read. \nFormer US presidents and top security officials usually keep their security clearance as a courtesy. \nTrump ordered department and agency leaders to \"revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities for these individuals.\"\n\"This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress,\" the order stated.\nFor several named figures, the loss of access to classified material and spaces will have a more symbolic impact. \nIt may limit the materials they are able to review, or restrict access to some government buildings or secure facilities.\nThe lawyers and prosecutors named by Trump, however, could potentially face roadblocks in accessing or reviewing information for their cases or clients.\nTrump's revocations focus on top Biden administration officials, as well as prominent political critics and attorneys who have challenged Trump or his allies in court.\nBiden's secretary of state Antony Blinken, national security advisor Jake Sullivan, and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco all lost their clearances.\nTrump also targeted two of his own former officials from his first term: Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman, who testified during his first impeachment trial that began in 2019.\nTrump also revoked access for high-profile Republican critics, former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\nThey were the only two Republican lawmakers who joined a US House investigation into Trump's role in the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress.\nBoth also voted to charge Trump in his second impeachment, which a Democratic-led US House of Representatives instigated after the riot. Trump was acquitted by the Senate on the charge of inciting the 6 January riot.\nTrump has also singled out top legal opponents in his latest decision on security access. His order revoked clearance for New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought multiple lawsuits against Trump and his businesses. \nIn a civil fraud lawsuit that concluded in 2024, a judge found Trump liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. Trump is appealing the decision.\nManhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who prosecuted and won Trump's criminal hush money case last year, also lost his clearance.\nTrump's legal targets went beyond elected prosecutors. He withdrew security clearance for Norm Eisen, an attorney leading multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. \nAndrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who joined an investigation of Trump during his first term and later provided media commentary about the hush money trial, also lost his clearance.\nPrevious media reports had indicated that the administration had pulled the security clearance for a top whistleblower attorney in Washington, Mark Zaid.\nFriday's order listed him among the individuals who would lose access. \nHowever, Mr Zaid told the BBC that \"despite being told three times that my clearance has been revoked, I still have not received anything formally.\"\nHe claimed losing his security clearance would harm \"the federal employees, including Trump supporters, who count on me to handle cases few other lawyers could.\"\nSeveral of the individuals chosen by Trump derided his order in social media statements.\n\"I don't care what noises Donald Trump makes about a security clearance that hasn't been active for five years,\" Mr Vindman wrote on X.\nMr Eisen wrote on X that being targeted by Trump's order \"just makes me file even more lawsuits!\" \nTrump had earlier pulled security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials whom he accused of meddling in the 2020 election in Joe Biden's favour. He provided no evidence for these claims.\nIn February, Trump announced he was revoking Biden's security access. In a social media post, Trump said Biden \"set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents\".\nIn 2021, Biden - serving as president at the time - barred his defeated rival Trump from having access to intelligence briefings citing his \"erratic behaviour\".\nA 2024 Justice Department special counsel report found Biden had improperly retained classified documents from his time as vice president. The report noted that Biden had cooperated with federal investigators and returned the discovered documents.\nIn 2023, Justice Department special prosecutor Jack Smith indicted Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents following his first term in office and obstructing their return to the government.\nTrump pleaded not guilty and a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. Smith officially dropped the case that December after Trump won re-election.",

As of 07:00 GMT the majority of departures had left as expected but of arrivals nine of the first 20 flights scheduled to land were cancelled. \nMore than 1,300 flights were affected on Friday, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers were told not to travel to the airport unless their airline advised them to. \nThe National Grid said that an \"interim solution\" had been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nFirefighters worked throughout the day to bring the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London, under control.\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added that when the power outage happened the back-up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening, with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nHeathrow said the airport was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, however a number of flights were cancelled and disruptions were expected to last days.\nThe closure had knock-on effects at many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nThe National Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.",

        "article_text": "Thomas Tuchel praised goalscoring debutant Myles Lewis-Skelly's performance\nEngland started the Thomas Tuchel era with a 2-0 victory over Albania in World Cup qualifying.\nTeenager Myles Lewis-Skelly scored on his senior international debut before captain Harry Kane netted his 70th England goal to seal the win.\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the talking points from the game.\nFirst impressions of 'low-key' Tuchel & his England team\nWho 'didn't show enough' against Albania? How England's players rated\n'He does everything right' - the remarkable rise of Lewis-Skelly\nThis average positions graphic shows how high England played against a defensive opponent (England are black and Albania are purple)\nBefore the game Tuchel created plenty of headlines when he said England looked like they had played with fear at Euro 2024 under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.\nHe also suggested he wanted them to play Premier League-style physical football.\nKnown for his tactical flexibility, nobody was quite certain what formation Tuchel would opt for - but he sent England out in a 4-2-3-1.\nWhile Tuchel's teams are normally known for their intensity and pressing, it was hard for England to show either against a team who set up as defensively as Albania, especially in the first half.\nAnd the German is also still in the early stages of his reign - having only met his players four days ago for the first time since officially taking over in January.\n\"Thomas Tuchel's had the squad for three days - you can't expect to see a different England team,\" said former Three Lions midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"We won the football match. Once we got ahead there was no urgency. \n\"We want to be entertained. There is a certain element of control which is good in tournament football.\n\"At the minute we're not in a tournament, we want to be entertained.\"\nEngland had 74% of the ball and 12 shots to Albania's three - with the hosts recording all six efforts on target in the game.\nIn the opening 45 minutes they completed 437 passes, the most on Opta's records of any England first half.\nThe visitors did try to play more after the break, but England's backline were only tested a few times by substitute Armando Broja. \nThe result itself was routine - new England manager or not. The Three Lions are unbeaten in 38 home qualifiers for World Cups or Euros since November 2007, with 34 wins. \n\"It was a difficult game from a spectating perspective,\" said former England defender Matt Upson on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Once we got into the rhythm, it was very much an England game at Wembley against inferior opposition where they struggled to break them down.\n\"We are all wanting to see how Thomas Tuchel's plan is going to happen.\n\"There are so many questions, but ultimately they have to manage the game itself and England did that well.\"\nUpson added that Tuchel probably learned to \"understand what it feels like and looks like tactically\" to play against a team in a low block like Albania's.\nJust a few months ago, Arsenal left-back Lewis-Skelly, 18, would barely have been on England's radar. He had not played a senior professional game until after the September international break.\nBut he has broken into Arsenal's first team, scored against Manchester City and been sent off twice (although one was overturned) in 26 games - and now firmly established himself as a Gunners regular.\n\"It doesn't get much better,\" said former Arsenal centre-back Upson.\n\"The opportunity has fallen to him, the timing has been great. The amount of injuries Arsenal had got him in the team.\n\"Those doors have opened, but he has had to grab those opportunities. He looks to be a top player.\"\nTuchel gave him a chance for England and he took it with both hands.\nIn a prime example of the modern full-back role, Lewis-Skelly was front-footed, cutting into central midfield and popping up in the box.\nAnd he got the opening goal when he appeared in the Albania area to score through Thomas Strakosha's legs from Jude Bellingham's fantastic through ball.\nThat made him the third-youngest England goalscorer ever - and youngest to net on his debut.\nMyles Lewis-Skelly had more touches in Albania's half than his own\n\"In the second half he played as a number eight or a number 10,\" said Tuchel. \n\"His very best position is where he plays for Arsenal in the double six. \n\"We tried to play a bit more conventional today as it's easier to learn because we have many players from many different clubs, but he understands very quickly.\"\nLewis-Skelly left the pitch to an ovation in the final minute.\nEngland tried three different left-backs in their final three Nations League games - Lewis Hall, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Rico Lewis - but Lewis-Skelly will hope to make the position his own.\nUpson said: \"He was absolutely superb. To manage and handle that occasion in the manner he did with the very limited senior football he has had... really speaks volumes about how good a player he is and how far he can go. It was a brilliant evening for him.\n\"When you look at the competition for that position, Lewis Hall is probably the closest. You can see a little battle between the two of them for the left-back slot. That was a big moment for Lewis-Skelly tonight to try to cement himself in Thomas Tuchel's mind for that role.\"\nEx-Everton player Osman added: \"He was dead relaxed, but he wasn't tested defensively.\n\"To secure the position he will have to show he can stand up defensively.\"\nDan Burn went close to his second Wembley headed goal in a week\nCentre-back Burn is at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to England debuts.\nThis was the 32-year-old's first appearance for England at any age level. In fact he was the oldest Three Lions debutant since Kevin Davies in 2010.\nIt came in what is undoubtedly the best week of the 6ft 7in defender's career.\nOn Sunday, also at Wembley, he headed his boyhood club Newcastle ahead against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final as they won 2-1 to lift a first trophy in 56 years.\nThe following day he joined up with England.\nHe was given an immediate debut by Tuchel - and did well.\nBurn became the first England debutant to make 100 or more passes on Opta's record - and ended up completing 135 from 137.\nHe made more clearances (seven), won more tackles (two) and won more aerial duels (four) than any other Three Lions player.\nPlus he managed to hit both crossbars, turning a clearance against his own woodwork before later heading Declan Rice's corner on to the bar.\nUpson said: \"He was excellent in the first half, looked very good but didn't have much to deal with defensively. He showed his threat from set-pieces.\"\nHowever, there were a few moments where he was caught out, especially when Broja came on.\nMarc Guehi, who was one of England's best players at Euro 2024, watched on from the bench with Ezri Konsa starting alongside Burn.\n\"There were a couple of moments in the second half where Burn got hurt in behind, got a bit tight and spun,\" said Upson. \"His partnership with Konsa was excellent.\n\"Konsa's performance was very assured and showed he's really developed in the last six months. Playing in the Champions League with Aston Villa has brought him on to the next level. \n\"Burn has moments of impact but I thought Konsa is probably best placed to keep his spot.\"\nRejection, non-league and pushing trolleys: Burn's rise to England\n'I don't want to go to sleep because I feel like I'm dreaming'\nEngland wingers Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford both failed to set the game alight.\nManchester United forward Rashford, on loan at Villa, was given his first England chance in a year after rediscovering his form under Unai Emery.\nHe showed a few good touches, especially early on, but failed to create much.\nManchester City's Foden had a similar experience on the right-hand side. \nThey were both replaced, along with Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones, in the 74th minute.\n\"Both of our wingers that started were not as impactful as they can be or as they are in club football,\" said Tuchel.\n\"At the moment I'm not so sure why we struggled to bring the ball quicker to them.\n\"They trained very well, they were decisive in training which is why they deserved it. They were very good in the last weeks in their clubs. \n\"We will keep encouraging them and give them a structure so they can show their potential.\"\nUpson said: \"Foden wants to come inside. He's not the type of out-and-out winger which Tuchel wants to play.\n\"He wants a fast-paced aggressive style - to go at teams. Foden is more of a footballer who likes to come to feet and open things up that way. \n\"Rashford showed willingness and he has that speed but didn't quite find the end product tonight. \n\"He was looking not to lose the ball instead of taking a risk. It's an area that will be tinkered with in games to come.\"\nHarry Kane is now 17 goals clear of Wayne Rooney's previous England goalscoring record\nCaptain Kane is England's all-time leading scorer by some way - and he netted his 70th international goal on Friday.\nIt came after a fine bit of control to take down Rice's cross before he passed the ball into the bottom corner.\nKane is the first England player to score on his first appearance under three different managers - Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate and Tuchel.\n\"Typical Kane,\" said Upson. \"He didn't get much action for quite long periods but a couple of his passes were superb. He drops deeps and clips those balls over the top. \n\"His finish was really high level. The first touch and movement and to find that bottom corner was excellent. Very much a Kane-type performance. \n\"He would probably want to be involved in the game a bit more in the build-up.

        "article_text": "Tomar has won nine of her 13 professional bouts\nPuja Tomar laughs nervously as she reveals her parents did not want her initially because she was a girl.\nIt surprises some of the journalists in the room, but for Tomar - the only Indian woman to ever fight in the UFC - it is the cornerstone of why she is doing this interview.\nHer start in life helped to forge her extraordinary resilience and character, her career, and everything she stands for today.\n\"My family and this society doesn't allow girls, they like only boys,\" Tomar tells BBC Sport. \n\"Before I was born, they wanted a boy. Even when I was a newborn, my mum told me my father didn't want a third girl.\"\nTomar, 31, was born in a small village called Budhana in Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India.\nHistorically, Indian families wanting boys over girls is common, particularly among poor communities, leading to a skewed sex ratio in favour of men.\nThere have been instances where unwanted baby girls have been buried alive and left to die in clay pots in the country.\nThe reasoning is rooted in widely held cultural beliefs that a male child would carry the family name, look after the parents in their old age, and perform the rituals on their death - while daughters would cost them dowries and leave them for their matrimonial homes.\nNo home, food or phone: Blachowicz's 'detox' from life\nI owe the UK fans after last performance - Edwards\nIn 2022, the United Nations estimated that nearly 400,000 female births - or 3% of all female births - are missed annually as a result of gender biased sex selection.\nTomar was the third of three sisters, which led to ridicule from other families because her dad had not fathered a boy. \nBut she did not let the misogyny she faced affect her.\nAfter losing her father at the age of seven, Tomar -  supported by her mum - was instead fuelled by the experience.\n\"After that, I wanted to beat boys. So I learned Jackie Chan movies and kung-fu and how to beat the boys,\" said Tomar.\n\"Even in the road I would go up to boys and say 'hey' \u2013 I tried to fight with boys. I wanted to prove myself.\n\"After that I realised I could be in sports, but nobody told me how to do it. My cousins, my family - nobody allows girls to go outside in India. But my mum, she fought for this day.\"\nTomar has a professional MMA record of nine wins and four losses\nTomar made a winning start on her UFC debut in June and on Saturday at UFC London at the O2 Arena, takes on Irish strawweight Shauna Bannon.\nUsing the platform she has in the UFC, Tomar wants parents in India to see the potential in daughters and treat them as equals to their sons.\n\"I just want to tell every parent to be proud you have a girl. Give confidence to your girls, give belief to them,\" said Tomar.\n\"Because if I can do it, many more can. Just open the gate. Don't think a girl is only there to make food, a girl can do anything, just give them opportunities.\"\nSince her UFC debut, Tomar says parents in her village have asked how their girls can start in mixed martial arts (MMA) - a movement which makes her \"proud\".\nThe success Tomar is experiencing would seem unimaginable from the moment she started her MMA journey.\nAlongside sex ratio discrimination, Indian sportswomen face multiple other challenges,, external including under-funded sport and sexual harassment and assault.\nTomar says she was around 24 years old when she first started training in MMA, but had difficulties finding gyms in India.\n\"I was in MMA with no experience, no coach. Just sometime I'd get help, but I had no coach,\" says Tomar.\n\"MMA sport training is very hard in India. In my society, you have to be fully clothed when you train with men. It's very hard.\"\nEventually Tomar would move to Soma Fight Club, which is a gym in Bali, Indonesia, where she still trains today.\nShe was signed by the UFC in 2023 after a four-fight winning streak.\n\"I kept going and kept going and one day I can show the world girls don't [belong only] in the kitchen,\" said Tomar.\n\"I just want to work hard and keep going and win and win.

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri converted pole position to win the Chinese Grand Prix, as McLaren made it two wins from two races at the start of the season.\nLando Norris finished second to make it a McLaren one-two, with George Russell's Mercedes completing the top three.\nFerrari's Lewis Hamilton won the sprint race on Saturday but he and team-mate Charles Leclerc were both disqualified from the main grand prix.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Shanghai.\nHow long do you think Red Bull will give Liam Lawson to get up to speed before contemplating a switch? - Jon\nIt rather looks as if their patience has already run out. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.\nIf they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.\nTo understand why, let's rewind.\nIn May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.\nThis was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.\nHorner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. But he remembered the tension between the Sainz and Verstappen camps when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso in 2015 and decided he did not want go there again.\nRe-signing Perez, Horner's theory went, would give him the confidence to recover his form.\nThe strategy failed spectacularly. Perez's performances fell off a cliff, and the team slumped to third in the constructors' championship despite Verstappen winning a fourth world title by 63 points.\nVerstappen only won twice in the final 14 races of the year because the car lost competitiveness and became difficult to drive. Hence Perez's struggles.\nBut Horner and Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko decided that Perez had had his day and they needed to make a change.\nThey paid him off - to the tune of many millions of dollars - and signed Lawson.\nThey picked the New Zealander over his much more experienced team-mate at the junior Racing Bulls team, Yuki Tsunoda, because they believed he had a mental toughness the Japanese lacked.\nLawson has had a dire start to the season. He qualified 18th at the season-opener in Melbourne, where he crashed out of the race, and last in both the sprint and grand prix in China, failing to make much progress in either event.\nBut Verstappen is also struggling - at least relatively. He is not hiding his belief that the car is the slowest of the top four teams - indeed he implied pretty strongly in China that he believed it may not be as fast as the Racing Bull.\nThe Red Bull is nervous on corner entry, has mid-corner understeer and is snappy on exits. And the team don't seem to know how to fix it.\nVerstappen likes a sharp front end, but he doesn't want the car to behave like this. But he can cope, and get a lap time out of it. Lawson cannot, at least not yet.\nLawson was talking in China as if he already knew the writing was on the wall.\n\"It's just (got) a very small window,\" he said. \"It's hard, you know \u2013 it's hard to drive, to get it in that window. I'd like to say that with time that'll come \u2013 I just don't have time to do that. It's something I need to get on top of.\"\nIf Red Bull drop him after two races, the management will have some serious explaining to do.\nIf signing him was the right decision in December, why is it the wrong decision now, they will be asked. If Tsunoda is the driver replacing him, the question becomes even starker.\nAnd if instead they choose Frenchman Isack Hadjar, who has impressed as Tsunoda's rookie team-mate in the first two grands prix, well, that's surely too early.\nEqually, if the first-order problem is the car - as it seems to be - why blame the driver?\nFor many in F1 there is an aphorism that sums up Red Bull's approach to their second seat: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\nLiam Lawson finished 12th in the Chinese Grand Prix, eight positions and nearly 55 seconds behind Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen\nAre Ferrari at fault for the double disqualification, or was it just unlucky and out of their control? \u2013 Ozan\nFormula 1 lives on the edge. To win, teams have to push their cars as close to the limit of the technical regulations as possible - because that is what everyone is doing.\nThe line between success and failure is so fine. And weight and ride height are two of the key performance differentiators.\nOne kilogram of extra weight in F1 costs approximately 0.035secs a lap. Multiply that by the 56 laps of the Chinese Grand Prix, for example, and it's two seconds of race time. Not a lot, but it could be the difference between winning and not, or one place higher or lower.\nThat's just to explain why cars are run to the edge. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.\nIn the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.\nFerrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.\nOf course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight. But exactly the same thing happened to Mercedes with George Russell in Belgium last year when he was disqualified from victory.\nAs for Lewis Hamilton, his skid blocks had worn too much. Again, it's the sort of thing that can happen - indeed, it happened to Hamilton when he was at Mercedes in the 2023 US Grand Prix, and Leclerc in the same race.\nAgain, it's about pushing the margins. Generally with these current cars, the lower they can be run, the more downforce they can create, as long as teams can keep the aerodynamics stable.\nBut run them too low, and they risk wearing the floor excessively - and that's what happened.\nThese things are generally not deliberate. They are just what can happen when pushing performance to the edge.\nAside from the McLaren, who has impressed you the most at this very early stage? \u2013 SJM\nRacing Bulls have had a very strong start to the season. Tsunoda qualified fifth in Australia, and his team-mate Hadjar was seventh on the grid and Tsunoda ninth in China.\nThe races have gone a bit wrong so far, but the car looks strong - in China, Verstappen was even implying it was better than the Red Bull.\nRacing Bulls use a fair few Red Bull parts but since Red Bull have started struggling that is not necessarily the boost it was in theory a year or two ago, when the close relationship between the two teams was causing concern among rivals.\nIn the cockpit, Hadjar, notwithstanding his crash on the formation lap in Australia, has made a strong first impression.\nOverall, a very positive start to the year by the second Red Bull team.\nRacing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda both finished the Chinese Grand Prix but outside of the points\nHow was there such a big gap between Lewis Hamilton's sprint pace and qualifying pace? Or how did the other drivers close the gap in such a short space of time? \u2013 Ash\nThere is a combination of reasons. Ferrari hit the ground running in China and landed on a decent set-up for sprint qualifying in the single practice session before it.\nOn top of that, Hamilton put in a brilliant performance on a track where he has always excelled to take pole.\nBut there was an element of underachievement from other teams involved.\nThe McLaren was the fastest car in China and Oscar Piastri was more comfortable in it than Lando Norris. Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.\nHamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.\nHe drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.\nThe teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.\nAs Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race.\"\nAmong those changes seems to have been lifting the car slightly, which Hamilton more or less confirmed after the race: \"I don't know who said we lifted the car, but we made some other changes, mostly, as well as that, but not massively, just small amounts.\"\nThey did not work - team-mate Leclerc was faster than Hamilton in the grand prix even though he had a damaged front wing. And the changes were not enough to stop Hamilton's car wearing the skid blocks too much. Hence his disqualification.\nThrow in Leclerc's disqualification for his car being underweight and it was a bad day at the office for Ferrari.\nWhy do teams put a board out from the pit wall as the drivers go through; surely all information is passed by the radio or telemetry? \u2013 Phil\nPit boards are there to give non-essential information relating to the drivers - primarily laps remaining. The gap to the drivers in front and behind are often also included.\nThey're also there as a back-up in case the radio fails.\nIt is, to a degree, a hangover from the past. But it's also simple and effective and there is no reason to stop doing it and plenty of reasons to continue.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\n'McLaren the class of the field but have hard tightrope to walk'\nObituary: Eddie Jordan, the flamboyant deal-maker of Formula 1\nChinese Grand Prix Review\nEddie Jordan Tribute",

Tsunoda qualified fifth in Australia, and his team-mate Hadjar was seventh on the grid and Tsunoda ninth in China.The races have gone a bit wrong so far, but the car looks strong - in China, Verstappen was even implying it was better than the Red Bull.Racing Bulls use a fair few Red Bull parts but since Red Bull have started struggling that is not necessarily the boost it was in theory a year or two ago, when the close relationship between the two teams was causing concern among rivals.In the cockpit, Hadjar, notwithstanding his crash on the formation lap in Australia, has made a strong first impression.Overall, a very positive start to the year by the second Red Bull team.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda both finished the Chinese Grand Prix but outside of the pointsHow was there such a big gap between Lewis Hamilton's sprint pace and qualifying pace? Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.Hamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.He drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.The teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.As Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.If they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.To understand why, let's rewind.In May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.This was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.Horner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.In the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.Ferrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.Of course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight.",

But what role will he have in the country's next government?\nSingh is running his third federal election campaign - and one where his party faces an uphill battle as recent polls show some of the lowest levels of support for Canada's left-wing New Democratic Party in years. \nThe NDP faces tough competition in Canada's 2025 election which is being held on 28 April. Prime Minister Mark Carney called it shortly after he was sworn in to replace former leader Justin Trudeau. \nLaunching his party's campaign, Singh attacked both Carney and US President Donald Trump, promising that only the New Democrats could be trusted to look out for ordinary Canadians.\nA practising Sikh, Singh is a former provincial Ontario legislator and lawyer by training. The 46-year-old took the helm of the party in 2017 despite no previous experience in federal politics.\nIn 2022, Singh's NDP agreed to help prop up Trudeau's minority Liberal government in exchange for support on their shared political priorities, in particular in developing a national dental care programme for low-income Canadians and a national prescription drug programme.\nBut last September, the NDP became the last of Canada's three main opposition parties to turn on Trudeau, with Singh accusing him of \"caving\" to corporate greed. \nThe NDP leader has also made headlines for confronting hecklers. He once approached a man who was heckling him with insults on Parliament Hill, asking him to \"say it to my face\" in a clip that later went viral. \nHe has faced other confrontations in the past, including a voter who told him to \"cut  your turban off\" during the 2019 election campaign - though he handled that situation cordially, replying that Canadians \"look like all sorts of people\" before walking away. \nSingh was born in Scarborough, Ontario, a city in the Greater Toronto Area, to Indian immigrants from the state of Punjab. \nSingh has said he was sexually abused by a taekwondo teacher as a child, revealing in a memoir later in life that he suffered the abuse while growing up in Windsor. \nAs a child, he also spent time in St Johns, and attended school across the border in Michigan for several years. He later got a degree in biology from the University of Western Ontario and a Bachelor of Laws from York University's Osgoode Hall Law School.\nSingh worked as a criminal defence attorney for years before pursuing provincial politics, eventually running provincially for a seat in the Ontario legislature in 2011.\nIn 2019, he won his first seat in Canada's parliament in by-election - or special election -  in Burnaby, British Columbia, east of Vancouver.\nThe former human rights activist ran on pledges to forgive student loan debt, to drastically reduce Canada's carbon emissions and to ensure universal prescription drug coverage. \nHe has found a large audience on TikTok and is also known for his style and well-tailored suits, with BuzzFeed once calling him the \"most stylish politician in Canada by like a million kilometres\".\nHe is married to fashion designer Gurkiran Kaur Sidhu, with whom he has two children.

In New Mexico, cases have risen to 42, with one measles-related death. \nWhile there are more cases of the virus, there is some good news: More people are getting the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination this year than last year.\nAccording to the CDC, a federal public health agency, the last time measles numbers were this high in the US was 2019 when the annual total was 1,274. But the number of cases each year from 2020 through 2023 were all lower than the number of cases in the first three months of 2025. \nThe MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.\nSince the outbreak began, more people are reportedly getting the vaccine.\nBetween 1 February and 18 March last year, the New Mexico Department of Health registered 6,500 measles vaccines, the Associated Press reported. In the same time period this year, more than 11,600 measles vaccines were administered in the state.\nBetween 1 January and 16 March, Texas gave at least 173, 000 measles doses compared to last year's 158,000 in the same time period, state health department data shows. \nBesides the outbreak spreading in Texas and New Mexico, measles cases were reported in other states and across Canada, as well. \nSo far this year in Canada there have been 224 measles cases, 173 confirmed and 51 probable, the government said. \nBut the epicentre remains in western Texas and neighbouring New Mexico, where two unvaccinated people have died from the virus this year.\nWhile the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago, the US still sees outbreaks, which are defined as three or more related cases.\nThe two deaths were jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded a measles death since 2015. The 2015 death was the first attributed to virus in the US since 2003.\nIn mid-April, CDC officials are expected to discuss the growing outbreak at a public meeting of its independent vaccine advisory panel.

        "article_text": "Tomar has won nine of her 13 professional bouts\nPuja Tomar laughs nervously as she reveals her parents did not want her initially because she was a girl.\nIt surprises some of the journalists in the room, but for Tomar - the only Indian woman to ever fight in the UFC - it is the cornerstone of why she is doing this interview.\nHer start in life helped to forge her extraordinary resilience and character, her career, and everything she stands for today.\n\"My family and this society doesn't allow girls, they like only boys,\" Tomar tells BBC Sport. \n\"Before I was born, they wanted a boy. Even when I was a newborn, my mum told me my father didn't want a third girl.\"\nTomar, 31, was born in a small village called Budhana in Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India.\nHistorically, Indian families wanting boys over girls is common, particularly among poor communities, leading to a skewed sex ratio in favour of men.\nThere have been instances where unwanted baby girls have been buried alive and left to die in clay pots in the country.\nThe reasoning is rooted in widely held cultural beliefs that a male child would carry the family name, look after the parents in their old age, and perform the rituals on their death - while daughters would cost them dowries and leave them for their matrimonial homes.\nNo home, food or phone: Blachowicz's 'detox' from life\nI owe the UK fans after last performance - Edwards\nIn 2022, the United Nations estimated that nearly 400,000 female births - or 3% of all female births - are missed annually as a result of gender biased sex selection.\nTomar was the third of three sisters, which led to ridicule from other families because her dad had not fathered a boy. \nBut she did not let the misogyny she faced affect her.\nAfter losing her father at the age of seven, Tomar -  supported by her mum - was instead fuelled by the experience.\n\"After that, I wanted to beat boys. So I learned Jackie Chan movies and kung-fu and how to beat the boys,\" said Tomar.\n\"Even in the road I would go up to boys and say 'hey' \u2013 I tried to fight with boys. I wanted to prove myself.\n\"After that I realised I could be in sports, but nobody told me how to do it. My cousins, my family - nobody allows girls to go outside in India. But my mum, she fought for this day.\"\nTomar has a professional MMA record of nine wins and four losses\nTomar made a winning start on her UFC debut in June and on Saturday at UFC London at the O2 Arena, takes on Irish strawweight Shauna Bannon.\nUsing the platform she has in the UFC, Tomar wants parents in India to see the potential in daughters and treat them as equals to their sons.\n\"I just want to tell every parent to be proud you have a girl. Give confidence to your girls, give belief to them,\" said Tomar.\n\"Because if I can do it, many more can. Just open the gate. Don't think a girl is only there to make food, a girl can do anything, just give them opportunities.\"\nSince her UFC debut, Tomar says parents in her village have asked how their girls can start in mixed martial arts (MMA) - a movement which makes her \"proud\".\nThe success Tomar is experiencing would seem unimaginable from the moment she started her MMA journey.\nAlongside sex ratio discrimination, Indian sportswomen face multiple other challenges,, external including under-funded sport and sexual harassment and assault.\nTomar says she was around 24 years old when she first started training in MMA, but had difficulties finding gyms in India.\n\"I was in MMA with no experience, no coach. Just sometime I'd get help, but I had no coach,\" says Tomar.\n\"MMA sport training is very hard in India. In my society, you have to be fully clothed when you train with men. It's very hard.\"\nEventually Tomar would move to Soma Fight Club, which is a gym in Bali, Indonesia, where she still trains today.\nShe was signed by the UFC in 2023 after a four-fight winning streak.\n\"I kept going and kept going and one day I can show the world girls don't [belong only] in the kitchen,\" said Tomar.\n\"I just want to work hard and keep going and win and win. One day I want to be on top.\"\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, there is information and support available on BBC Action Line.\nMMA schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.\nThose discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.\n\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.\n\"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds.\n\"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\"\nThorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.\nChief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.\nBut the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.\n\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"\nHis parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.\nBut Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.\n\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.\n\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"\nThe writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.\nHe found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.\n\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.\n\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.\n\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"\nThese issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.\nOn Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".\n\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.\nThorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.\n\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.\n\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.\n\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"\nSo what could more radical solutions be?\nThis week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.\nViolence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.\nThorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".\n\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.\nHe urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.\nThe writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.\n\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.\nA ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though.\nThorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21.\nWhen asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings.\nOne said it was \"a great idea, within reason\", another said it would be \"quite unfair\", while the third was against the idea, arguing that \"social media has brought a lot of good to young generations as well\".\nFor Thorne, the question about how to police smartphones and social media is about to come very close to home.\nHis son is eight, and Thorne says he wants to make sure he establishes \"a method of communicating with him\" as he grows up. Soon, he will want his own phone.\nWhile working on the series, he has been thinking about how to handle his son's future use of technology. \"And I'm still processing how to do it.\"\nResearching and writing Adolescence has opened his eyes about the challenges facing young people and parents, he says. But how to tackle them? That's the hardest part.",

So Jon was almost the opposite, he's been quite slack about what the players can do both on and off the pitch.\n\"I think Edwards has the best of both. She has that balance of making sure players are accountable on and off the field, but also bringing in some fun and understanding that players are not robots. She can recognise the moments when they need that breathing space.\" \nWorld Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley also backed Edwards for the job and described her as a \"brilliant, outstanding coach\". \n\"She'll really get hold of this team and she'll know how to make the standards better so they can compete under pressure,\" Hartley said.\n\"She gives you free rein to work out things for yourself but doesn't take any nonsense and that is what England need right now.\"\nThe potential candidates are not as clear regarding England's next captain, though Nat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely option having been Knight's deputy with many, including both Greenway and Hartley, naming off-spinner Charlie Dean as a contender.\n\"It has been one of the biggest downfalls over the past five or six years that there isn't a standout candidate to take over,\" Hartley added.\n\"They need a coach who can get the culture right, control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room, and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

I'm that foul-mouthed [person] that you've come to dredge up some grudging affection for, but I may yet do the wrong thing.\"\nFor someone who has always gone against the grain, and occasionally off the rails, it is hard to imagine what he could do now to diminish his status, however.\nOne honour the Salford-born wordsmith has agreed to accept is the 2025 Northern Music Award, which he will receive at a ceremony in Liverpool on Thursday.\nAlthough not strictly a musician, Clarke is closely associated with the music scene - from punk to the Arctic Monkeys, who turned his 1982 poem I Wanna Be Yours into a song that was the closing track on their 2013 album AM. \nIt was never officially released as a single but has since gone on to be streamed nearly three billion times by music fans and ranks among Spotify's all-time Top 40. \nMany of Clarke's poems were originally released with musical backings masterminded by producer Martin Hannett, who was known for his work with Joy Division.\nClarke has mixed feelings about the results.\n\"It was never my idea to put my poetry to music but I couldn't think of an argument against it,\" he says.\n\"So it was a new adventure for me, but I think the results were patchy. When it was good, it was great. But I'm hyper-critical of my own stuff.\n\"It wasn't my idea, that's all I'm saying, but I'm glad I did it now. It's put me in line for this award, for a start.\"\nTwo days after that ceremony, Clarke will achieve another landmark moment when he headlines Manchester's Co-op Live arena, albeit with a scaled-back set-up compared with its full 23,500 capacity.\nHas he ever performed in an arena? \"I've done outdoor shows that I suppose qualify as an arena,\" he says. \"But I've never done an arena with a lid on it like this one before.\"\nIt will be a far cry from the cabaret clubs where he started out in the city in the 60s, and the punk nights where he made his name in the 70s, after winning over hostile fans who initially aimed spit and bottles in his direction.\nSo what's more intimidating - playing to a small room of punks, or an arena with thousands of people?\n\"The more the merrier,\" he replies. \"If you're selling tickets for a living, the more the merrier.\"\nHe performed live with Joy Division, the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, The Fall and Elvis Costello, achieving cult status with social-realist poems like Beasley Street and Evidently Chickentown, the antisocial I Don't Wanna Be Nice, and the more surrealist (I Married A) Monster From Outer Space and Valley of the Lost Women.\nHowever, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.\n\"Well, I died four times. I came back but medical action was called for. I'm the luckiest guy alive. Somebody up there likes me.\"\nClarke eventually got clean after meeting his wife Evie, and his professional revival really began when Evidently Chickentown was used over the end credits of an episode in the final season of The Sopranos in 2007.\nFellow poets, comedians and musicians lined up to hail his influence in a 2012 BBC documentary, with Steve Coogan speaking about his \"spirit of dissent\", and Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner, calling him \"my hero\".\nTurner turned him into Britain's most listened-to poet by using his words in the Arctic Monkeys' 2013 song I Wanna Be Yours.\nThe original I Wanna Be Yours is a rare example in Clarke's catalogue of an unabashed love poem, albeit an unconventional one. \"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust,\" it begins.\nClarke originally released the poem on record with a kitsch musical backing in 1982.\n\"It should have been done like Alex does it from the start,\" he says. \"I mean, that is the definitive version. I love it.\"\nThe Arctics' version continues to strike a chord with a new generation and last year it had more streams around the world than any other track over a decade old.\nMeanwhile, the poem has also become a popular choice as a wedding reading.\n\"I'd be a billionaire if I had a quid for every person that recited that poem at their wedding,\" Clarke remarks.\nHe may not have that income stream, but he will have got a fraction of a penny for each of the song's three billion streams.\n\"It adds up, and then there's the PRS [royalties],\" he says.\n\"So I'm not complaining. For a change.\" He lets out another loud cackle.\nJohn Cooper Clarke plays Manchester's Co-op Live arena on Saturday, 29 March.",

It comes before football.\"\nAs Ramadan draws to a close, Bournemouth's Dango Ouattara is clear where his priorities lie.\nThe forward from Burkina Faso is a devout Muslim who prays five times a day, as well as before and after each game he plays, saying it helps him to \"stay humble\".\n\"It allows us to refocus on ourselves, to see what we've done well and what we haven't been able to do well,\" the 23-year-old tells BBC Sport Africa when we meet at his local mosque in Poole.\n\"It also allows us to correct ourselves in society too. It allows us to stay on the right path.\"\nDuring our conversation, Ouattara regularly uses words such as \"calm\" and \"stable\" to describe the benefits of Islam.\nA quiet and thoughtful character, verging on shy, there is nothing bling about him. He arrives early for our interview, dressed head-to-toe in white, asking to pray before we settle down to chat.\n\"Faith allows me to overcome many challenges, to respect others, to respect choices and religions too,\" he explains.\n\"Whether it's on the pitch, off it with friends or even with my family, it allows me to be calm in my daily life.\n\"You have to believe before you can do something.\"\n'Fans are living through Bournemouth's best period - enjoy the ride'\nBournemouth's Semenyo motivated by trial rejections\nThis season, Ouattara seems full of belief in his own abilities.\nDespite not being a consistent starter, he has nine goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for the Cherries, including a hat-trick against Nottingham Forest in January.\nThose numbers are a vast improvement on last season, when he only scored once.\nWith Andoni Iraola's side potentially challenging for European football, Ouattara says the team is \"great fun\" to play in.\n\"The secret this year is that we've had the same squad, virtually the same players and the same coach. It's important to have a group that continues to develop together,\" he added.\n\"You can see every time that the players enjoy it.\n\"We're going to do everything we can to go further.\"\nBorn in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital, Ouattara himself has been on a journey, having arrived on England's south coast via French side Lorient.\nSigned for \u00a320m ($26m), when he made his debut in January 2023 he became only the second Burkinabe to appear in the Premier League, following on from his national team captain and former Aston Villa forward Bertrand Traore.\nStill uncomfortable speaking in English for prolonged periods, he confirms language was the main problem when he arrived, but says religion played its part there too.\n\"My agent and I were able to find the mosque, so I started to get back into my routine,\" he explains.\n\"And as I came to the mosque, everything went well for me with the football. So I found myself back in the environment I'd left behind in Lorient.\n\"It helps because when you find yourself in another town, having the community shows that you're not alone. You have the opportunity to pray with other people, to meet new people.\n\"It keeps us focused on religion.\"\nOuattara tries to visit his local mosque in Poole as often as his training schedule allows\nThis year, Ramadan began on Friday 28 February and will finish on Sunday 30 March.\nThe month is considered holy as Muslims believe it marks when the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.\nFor adherents, fasting plays a key role, foregoing food and drink between sunrise and sunset.\n\"I wouldn't say that Ramadan is difficult, it's more mental, because personally I'm used to doing it,\" says Ouattara.\n\"It's more the lack of water. And given that you have to wake up at unusual times to eat, that's more tiring.\"\nBut he has a cunning plan to combat the fatigue: naps.\n\"I wake up at 4.30am, I do my ablutions and I've already got the food which has already been prepared by the club chef.\n\"I eat, and after prayers I have time to go back to bed for an hour or so before training.\n\"Then after the sessions I say my prayers and sleep for another hour. So the fact that I rest each time means I recover better.\"\n'Faith before work' - Doucoure's life as a Muslim player\n'Ramadan is a time to enjoy what you have' Video, 00:03:50'Ramadan is a time to enjoy what you have'\nDespite his fast, and when he is not napping, Ouattara's training plan remains pretty much the same.\n\"It's even easier when you have the support of the whole team, whether it's the players or the staff,\" he said.\n\"Everyone asks me 'How are you feeling? Is it going well? Is it not too difficult?'\n\"They understand me and they encourage me.\"\nAlthough he is the only Muslim in Bournemouth's squad, Ouattara is far from alone as a Premier League player fasting during Ramadan.\nIndeed, the month has become so high profile that in 2021 the league introduced a new agreement that allows officials to call a halt to games in progress at sunset to allow players to break their fast.\nIt is something for which Ouattara is grateful.\n\"The initiative of the Premier League is to be congratulated because it's not easy to play while fasting,\" he added.\n\"We hope that it will continue.\"\nDango Ouattara is someone who hears the call to prayer strongly, something that has helped turn him into a player Bournemouth fans can have faith in.\nBournemouth",

        "article_text": "Computers and smartphones might be where most writing is done these days, but typewriters still have work to do in the US.\nPretty much every day, another customer clutching an old typewriter will walk into Mike Marr's shop in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Marr carefully looks the machine over. Invariably, it will be a total mess. Made decades ago, the hunk of heavy metal bristling with moving parts is now laced with years of grime. The keys are too stiff. Or maybe the paper that's supposed to glide through it keeps getting stuck.\n\"Do you think you can get it going again?\" the customer will ask, a touch of anxiety in their voice. Marr, who has been repairing typewriters for more than 20 years, will say he'll give it his best shot.\n\"When they come in and pick that typewriter up, just seeing their smile is everything to us,\" he says. Even in the year 2025, a century and a half after the first commercially successful typewriter was introduced to the American public, surprising numbers of people in the US are still using these machines. And not just for fun \u2013 many of Marr's customers are businesses. \"We're still servicing probably 20 to 25 typewriters a week,\" he says. He employs three other people in his shop to keep up with the demand. \"Isn't that crazy?\"\nIn today's world, internet-connected computers and smartphones are king. They're used for the vast majority of business tasks and transactions. But here and there, in little offices and warehouses, you can still find a well-worn typewriter lingering in the corner. A machine whose keys have been pressed many thousands, if not millions, of times. To this day, typewriters print names on forms. They put addresses on envelopes. They fill out cheques. And the people who use them, generally speaking, have no intention of switching to a computer any time soon \u2013 at least for those particular tasks.\nIt was back in 1953 that Marr's grandfather founded the business he now runs: Marr Office Equipment. Decades ago, a call came through from IBM. The tech giant was looking for a new typewriter distributor in the northeast of the US. Marr's father and uncle, in charge at the time, were over the moon. \"That was the biggest thing that could ever happen to them,\" says Marr. \"Trailer trucks would just pull up and unload IBM after IBM. They'd already be sold. We couldn't keep up with it.\"\nMarr Office Equipment's heyday may be long gone but Marr still knows typewriter users all over his local area. He mentions one that is about a 10 minute drive away, in south Providence \u2013 a law firm named Tomasso & Tomasso, co-owned by brothers John and Ray, both attorneys. \"We sound exactly alike,\" says John, laughing as he introduces himself over the phone. Do they actually still rely on typewriters? Absolutely. \"There's not a day that goes by that we don't use them,\" says Tomasso. \"This is really still the best way.\"\nThe firm's office has three typewriters, John says and his colleagues still use them to type up cheques and fill in legal forms to ensure the details on those documents are legible. Plus, there's a security angle. It's very hard to hack a typewriter since they are not connected to the internet. In 2013, jaw-dropping details emerged about the extent of US intelligence agency surveillance programmes. This prompted the Russian Federal Guard Service (FSO) to revert to typewriters in an attempt to evade eavesdropping. German officials were also reported to be considering a similar move in 2014. (During the Cold War, Soviet spies actually developed techniques for snooping on electric typewriter activity, a form of \"keylogging\" technology \u2013 where the keystrokes inputted on a keyboard are captured. US operatives also reconstructed text from typewriter ribbons \u2013 meaning that even typewriters aren't completely safe.)\nI ask Tomasso whether there are downsides to using the typewriter \u2013 isn't it harder to correct mistakes? No, he replies, he has a model with an \"eraser ribbon\" that seamlessly covers up a mistype. Plus, the typewriters are inexpensive to run. Replacement ink ribbons cost around $5 (\u00a34), he estimates. Replacement printer ink cartridges can cost several times that.\nBesides, Tomasso loves to see his writing materialise instantly on the page in front of him. \"There's more of a sense of accomplishment than just letters that appear on a screen,\" he explains. \"It's one of those amazing devices that just makes our life better \u2013 I think that's the purpose of technology.\"\nFurther west, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a real estate agency called Jarvis Realty, owned and run by Woody Jarvis. \"I'm real old school,\" he says. Jarvis, too, regularly uses a typewriter for office work. He gives the example of putting together an offer of purchase for a client. It'll start on the computer but he'll then print the document out and, should he need to make any modifications, he prefers to use correction fluid and his typewriter rather than re-printing the contract and wasting a lot of paper. \"Our contracts are very legible and easy to understand,\" he says. He'll also occasionally type up a name and address on an envelope for a colleague. \"For me, it works because I know how to make it all work.\"\nTypewriters have had a long and colourful history. Centuries ago, tinkerers came up with early, experimental typing machines but they didn't really catch on. Then, in 1868, the first device actually called a typewriter emerged: the Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer, which was patented that year by four inventors in Milwaukee. One of the group, Christopher Latham Sholes, also invented the Qwerty keyboard. Without him, typing \u2013 even on computers \u2013 might be very different today. By the 20th Century, typewriters were everywhere. Millions of the machines were sold in the first few decades of the 1900s and by the mid-1980s, the typewriter industry was worth more than $1.1bn (\u00a3764m) in the US alone, according to press reports from the time.\nIn the 21st Century, typewriters have remained popular in certain corners of the world, despite the rise of computers. In India, for example, typewriters have found a flourishing market among enthusiasts and are still a common \u2013 albeit steadily vanishing \u2013 sight in courts and government offices.\nJarvis's cousin, Lisa Floading, who works at the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, is a big fan of typewriters. She has 62 of them. \"There's something very inviting about a typewriter waiting with paper in it,\" she explains. \"I have them all over my house.\"\nFloading uses a typewriter every day, she says, to make lists or write letters, and for office admin. \"There it is, you wrote three pages, boom, done. That's kind of lost on the laptop,\" she says. And she'll even bring a typewriter to her local coffee shop sometimes so she can work on it there. People regularly come up to her to ask about it, she says.\nIn June, Floading took part in an event in Milwaukee called Qwertyfest \u2013 intended to celebrate both the typewriter and the Qwerty keyboard layout, in memory of Christopher Latham Sholes. Among the attractions was a room full of typewriters where attendees could simply sit down and type. The sound of clacking keys and carriages returning filled the space. It was once a sound common in typing pools in businesses around the country.\nJim Riegert, now in his 70s, remembers what it used to be like. \"Back then, typewriters were pretty big. Typewriters and adding machines,\" he says, referring to desktop calculators. \"It got really difficult in the typewriter business about 25 years ago,\" he says. \"The internet was coming on and killing us, too.\" He runs Typewriters.com and, despite a decline in sales in recent decades, he still shifts four or five electric IBM typewriters every week. \"I just sold 12 to a prison that's putting them in the library because they don't let prisoners use computers,\" he says. Funeral homes, some of which use typewriters to compile death certificates, are also regular clients.\nRiegert's business is based in the city of Tucker, Georgia. His own office, inside a giant warehouse, is crammed witharound 70 or 80 IBM electric typewriters \u2013 second-hand units, which he services and sells. The build quality is top notch, he stresses. A prime model could set you back $749 (\u00a3594). When they were brand new in 1984 they would sell for around $1,000, but even accounting for inflation they have retained a surprising amount of value in the digital age.\u00a0 \"They're still the best typewriters you can buy,\" he says. These days, demand might be low \u2013 but somehow business remains steady, and profitable.\nIBM, nowadays arguably better known for supercomputers such as Watson, sold its typewriter business to Lexmark in the early 1990s. However, an IBM spokesperson says on very rare occasions, \"some people do ask for old manuals or service documents for typewriters, which we can provide if they're in the archives\". Lexmark, meanwhile, sold its last typewriter in 2002 and no longer has any typewriter-related services, though some of its former distributors still carry out maintenance on IBM Lexmark typewriters.\nIf, on the other hand, you want to buy a brand-new typewriter, that too remains possible. Many thousands are still manufactured every year. Todd Althoff is president of Royal, a US company that has been making typewriters since 1904. \"We're going to continue,\" he insists. \"Obviously [there is] not that much growth but it's sustainable and we keep the factory busy.\"\nThe factory is in Indonesia, he explains, and is run by a team from Nakajima, a typewriter manufacturing firm from Japan. Every year, Royal still sells around 20,000 new electric typewriters and more than double that amount of mechanical typewriters. The latter have become desirable partly as decoration \u2013 a librarian might buy one for a display at the front of their library, for instance, suggests Althoff. The mechanical and electric models Royal sells cost between $300 (\u00a3238) and $400 (\u00a3317).\nThankfully, there are still companies that make new typewriter ribbons, notes Paul Lundy, who runs Bremerton Office Machine Company, a typewriter repair business in Seattle. \"Those accessories are readily available,\" he says. \"As a person who repairs typewriters, that's always running at the back of my mind \u2013 why are businesses still using these things?\"\nBut he has some good examples, including workers in warehouses who must continually process the transfer of goods by filling out forms. It's hard to feed these complex forms into a computer printer so that information gets printed onto them in exactly the right places. So, says Lundy, the warehouse workers prefer to insert the form into a typewriter and type it up by sight instead.\nOver the years, he's noticed that some aging typewriter parts are becoming more fragile, in some cases possibly as a result of plastic fatigue. But overall, they remain \"incredibly durable\" machines, he says.\nAnd, best of all, when you sit down to use one, there are no distractions. You just type. One of Lundy's customers who appreciates this perhaps more than most is Anjali Banerjee, a novelist who lives in Seattle. She has published 15 books and she wrote the first drafts of the last three on a typewriter.\nSome years ago, Banerjee began getting increasingly frustrated when trying to type new material on her computer. Notifications kept popping up or her word processing software would repeatedly intervene on things like spelling and grammar. So she went out and bought a typewriter.\nBanerjee started with an electric model but then got interested in mechanical versions. Now, she claims that her first drafts emerge more fluidly when she sits down at a typewriter rather than a screen. \"I have to keep moving forward. The story moves faster, if that makes sense,\" she says. \"You have to put it out there, like clay.\" The further editing \u2013 or shaping of the clay \u2013 takes place after she scans the typewriter-produced drafts into her computer.\nBanerjee goes on to admit candidly: \"I developed what we call 'typewriter fever'.\"\nFollowing her first typewriter purchase in 2019, she built up an astonishing collection of no fewer than 120 machines. However, she has recently slimmed this down to about 80 typewriters and plans to sell off roughly half of those. In essence, it became an epic search to find her perfect typewriter. And Banerjee has definitely discovered some personal favourites, such as her Olivetti Studio 45, an Italian-made model. The author, who also plays piano, compares typing on a typewriter to playing a tune on the instrument. It's percussive. And it requires more effort from your hands and fingers than a computer keyboard. She has sought out typewriters that are just right \u2013 not too stiff, not too loose. But a good, deep \"throw\" (the depth of key press required) is satisfying, she adds.\nTypewriters engage the senses, says Banerjee. You hear the energetic clack-clack-clack of the keys as you work away. You might even detect the musty aroma of old offices or maybe long-faded cigarettes. In that atmosphere of industry distilled, you focus in on what you're doing. \"I lose time,\" she says. She'll look up and two hours may have gone by. Her thoughts are right there on the pages in front of her.\nAs long as there are writers like Banerjee, and office workers who prize well-practised convenience over modernity, typewriters will never be completely obsolete, it seems.\nThat ought to keep Mike Marr busy, at his shop in Rhode Island. \"I was born and bred to repair typewriters and office equipment,\" he says. \"It's all I know in life.\"\nMany of the ailing machines that customers bring to him are fundamentally in good condition, merely requiring a clean and a re-oiling of their moving parts. A smattering of decades-old grease in the machine's tightest nooks and crannies has simply dried up. But that's an easy fix. The typewriter itself is perfectly fine \u2013 and it has plenty more work to do.\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister and Liberal leader Mark Carney has called an election in Canada, kickstarting five weeks of campaigning before Canadians head to the polls.\nVoting day will officially be on Monday 28 April.\nIt will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the two major parties in Canada - the Conservatives and the Liberals - are neck-and-neck in the polls, making it a race to watch.\nWhile Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.\nHere is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major parties.\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few days.\nHis party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.\nFor many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.\nHe was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. \nCarney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.\nBut Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. His French is also weak, which could be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec. \nRecent polls show his party is slightly trailing behind the Conservatives, but more Canadians say they think Carney would be a better prime minister than his opponent Pierre Poilievre.\nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.\nSince then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.\nHe is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government.\nIt is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.\nBut the Liberal Party has since caught up to him in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader.\nPoilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".\nPoilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first.\"\nTrump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.\nStill, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.\nBlanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, calling Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nHe has also dismissed Trump's tariffs, saying: \"I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.\"\nOn domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs.\nBlanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.\nPolling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.\nIn 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.\nThe NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\nBut in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.\nAt the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\nBut his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls show that only 9% of Canadians intend to vote for them as of mid-March, with their ground shrinking while support for the Liberals has risen.\nA big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. \nIn the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.\nAs Canada gears up for an election this year, the BBC wants to hear from voters across the country.

There was no communication from them until 11:00 and even this it was only that they could take us back on Monday, which would involve an eight hour stay at Heathrow.\n \"If you didn't want the flight you had to phone a number that took forever to get through, but I suspect it was a minor inconvenience compared to some.\"\nLess fortunate was Liz Steele, who missed her youngest son Paddy's graduation in Stirling on Friday.\nShe told BBC News: \"It was devastating. \n\"I know that there are people that have been affected much worse than this, but I've been to every other graduation that my kids have had, Masters and undergrads, and I just always thought that I would be there.\"\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye denied the incident - caused by a transformer catching fire within the North Hyde electrical substation - had made the airport a \"laughing stock\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"We have other substations but to switch them in takes time.\n\"The situation was not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences.\" \nA spokesperson for British Airways said around 85% of its services would be able to fly today.\nOn social media Heathrow Airport advised all passengers to check flights in advance before travelling.",

Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website & app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra\nWales will start their World Cup qualifying campaign on Saturday looking to right the wrongs of history.\nThis is not the familiar tale of the many near misses that littered their painful distant past, but rather a recent triumph that turned into dismal failure.\nBy reaching the 2022 World Cup, Wales realised a dream; glorious catharsis after 64 barren years without playing on football's biggest stage.\nBut once they got to Qatar, that dream became a nightmare.\nAs one Football Association of Wales official in Doha put it: \"We'd waited a lifetime, and then it was a disaster.\"\nIt was not simply Wales' first-round exit that was so dispiriting, but the manner of it. This was the opportunity of a generation, squandered - and it still rankles.\nThat is why this team view the 2026 World Cup as \"unfinished business\" according to midfielder Joe Allen, a chance to make amends for Qatar.\nWales not only want to secure their place at next year's tournament but make a meaningful impact when they get there, having failed so miserably to do so last time.\n\"It is something that sticks with me and I'm sure it sticks with a lot of the guys,\" says captain Ben Davies.\n\"The best moment of Qatar for us was probably just the Ukraine [play-off] game in getting there. It was disappointing out there and it was something that was tough to get over for a while.\n\"We didn't really show how good we can be on the world stage and that hunger to go and do it again is definitely there.\"\n'For him, for them' - Williams' family inspiration\nQuiz: How well do you know Bellamy's career?\n'That'll hurt forever' - World Cup pain drives Bellamy\nThe significance of qualifying transcended football for Wales, a country which had never enjoyed the global attention that comes with a modern-day World Cup.\nThey had less time to prepare than other teams in Qatar, having only sealed qualification five months earlier with a play-off win over Ukraine - but the FAW understood the logistics of major tournaments having been to the previous two European Championships.\nEuro 2016 in particular had been a transformative success for Wales, though a World Cup was on a different level.\nThe nation grasped the cultural and political value of this opportunity but, in terms of the football, there were reservations.\nManager Rob Page had performed admirably after stepping into the role in difficult circumstances following Ryan Giggs' abrupt departure in 2020.\nHaving led the team to the knockout stages of Euro 2020, Page etched his name into Welsh football history by becoming the first man to take Wales to a World Cup since 1958.\nThat can never be taken away from the former captain but, even by his own admission, this was a job he never thought he would have, considering his only previous managerial experience had come at Port Vale and Northampton Town.\nPage was popular with the Wales squad but some performances during World Cup qualifying, such as a goalless home draw with Estonia \u2013 as well as the 4-0 thrashing by Denmark at Euro 2020 \u2013 had prompted criticism, with some questioning his credentials at this level.\n\"The players all liked Rob as a person but some were unsure about him as a coach,\" another FAW source tells BBC Sport Wales.\n\"When the squad met up in Cardiff before travelling to Qatar, the feeling seemed to be that they weren't as well prepared as they could have been.\"\nMatters did not improve when they got to Qatar. The timing and location of training sessions had to be changed at the last minute because of the searing heat, while some staff felt team meetings were disorganised.\nSome players were also unimpressed by the content of training sessions and, with the likes of Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Allen already lacking match sharpness due to limited game time at their clubs, there was a pervading sense that Wales were entering this tournament undercooked.\n\"Could we have gone with fresher legs from the start? It's easy to say now, in hindsight,\" Page said after returning home.\nPage only realised in hindsight what many felt was obvious before and during the event; his lack of foresight would prove costly.\nThis video can not be played\nWales begin World Cup journey live on BBC Wales\nRob Page is the only man to have managed Wales at two major tournaments\nWales' World Cup campaign started to unravel at the very moment it began in earnest.\nThey were fortunate to draw against the United States in their opening game, Page admitting he got his selection and tactics wrong as his side were outplayed by dynamic, athletically superior opposition.\nBale's late penalty rescued Wales on that occasion but, with their all-time leading scorer's influence waning as retirement loomed, Page's side would have no such luck in their remaining two fixtures.\nThe manager said there were \"lessons learned\" against the USA but he proceeded to repeat the same mistakes against Iran as Wales were overwhelmed physically once again, hopelessly overrun as Iran won 2-0.\nMore than effectively extinguishing Welsh hopes of reaching the second round, this felt like the beginning of the end of their golden generation.\nBale, Ramsey and Allen were all key figures in Wales' dizzying ascent to the Euro 2016 semi-finals but, in the baking desert heat of Qatar, they had been reduced to shrivelled imitations of their former selves.\nThe final ignominy was a 3-0 defeat against England which could have been a far more severe drubbing had Gareth Southgate's men felt the urge.\nJust a week after their first World Cup game for 64 years, Wales were heading home.\n\"Hopefully, next time we qualify it won't just be about being there,\" says defender Neco Williams, who started all three matches.\n\"Last time, we were just there.\"\nPlenty wanted Page gone while others felt World Cup qualification had made him close to unsackable, or at least had earned him another chance.\nHowever, he was soon under pressure after a humiliating 4-2 home defeat against Armenia derailed their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign.\nAlthough he held on to his job despite missing out on qualification, Page was eventually dismissed last summer and replaced by Craig Bellamy.\nBellamy has started superbly, unbeaten in six games having led Wales to the Nations League's top division and instilled a bold new playing style in the process.\nHis ultimate aim, as he stated on his first day in the job, is to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.\nAnd more than that, having seen how Wales fared in Qatar and how that disappointment still burns in his players, Bellamy wants his team to do themselves justice if they get to next year's competition in the USA, Canada and Mexico.\n\"These boys have got to a World Cup. I understand the motivation to move that again because of what happened last time,\" he says.\n\"We always talk about 'us against the world' but we're not an underdog. I don't believe in that, and I won't have it. Now, at times you use it, but you can't live on it because it only lasts so long.\n\"For me, it's always 'no, we are more'.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHighlights: Scotland 0-3 Greece\nWith 17 minutes left to play at Hampden, Greece manager Ivan Jovanovic added insult to Scottish injury when calling ashore two of his best players, the duo who had done more than anybody else to put his team into an unassailable lead.\nThe game was long done by then; 3-0 going on more. Scotland had been as wretched as Greece had been classy. Part of Hampden was exasperated, part of it was angry, another part was on its way home, fed up.\nGiannis Konstantelias had scored Greece's first and assisted the second.  No need to exert him any more, not when there was not a scintilla of a threat of a comeback from Scotland.\nKonstantinos Karetsas, the teenage sensation, had scored that brilliant second goal. He came off, too. Job done. Another mortifying reflection of Greece's dominance.\nWas 'embarrassing night' just a 'bump in road' for Scotland?\nScotland relegated from Nations League A after dismal loss to Greece\nScotland didn't have a whole load of composure from the start, but at a painfully early stage they lost the bit they had. Lewis Ferguson clothes-lined an opponent and got a yellow card. George Hirst went yapping to the referee and he got booked as well.\nAs the savage reality of their own inadequacies was hitting them right between the eyes, Kieran Tierney had possession 20 yards into the Greek half. In front of him, a barren landscape. No movement, no options. He turned and booted it back to Craig Gordon and Hampden let him have it.\nBoos rang around the national stadium and it was fair enough. A few moments later, Grant Hanley played an agricultural hoof down the park, the ball careering out of play with no Scotsman in sight. Cue another visceral response from the home fans.\nShortly after that Gordon knocked a clearance straight to Greek substitute Giorgos Masouras. Slapstick stuff. \"Embarrassing\" as John McGinn described the performance, later on. And it was. Embarrassing and unsettling.\nRyan Christie expressed his frustration, \"especially with how well the first leg went\". We could revisit that now. The bottom line of Athens last Thursday was, indeed, amazing, but there were warning signs.\nScotland won the game through a penalty they should never have got and a defensive display that was always going to be hard to repeat.\nJovanovic learned a lot about how to attack this Scotland team. They tore them apart with their speed of thought and speed of movement, the accuracy in their passing and the ruthlessness in their finishing.\nWe could go on and on in highlighting Scotland's failings. We could document their shocking lack of accuracy and their dismal habit of affording Greece all the time and space they needed to build their lead, but it would take too long.\nWhat you were left with at the end was a feeling of despondency at how poor Scotland actually were. If there was hope, and belief, that this type of performance was maybe behind them, then this was the rudest of rude awakenings.\nIt was a return to the worst of times under Steve Clarke - the World Cup exit to Ukraine, the horrible loss in Dublin that followed it, the soul-destroyer against Hungary in Germany. It was only one bad day amid a recent upturn, yes, but it felt worse than that.\nSeeing practically all of Scotland's go-to men fail was quite something. Just when you had trust in them again after three excellent victories in a row, they go and do this.\nThis video can not be played\nClarke will 'look at what I could have done better'\nClarke has shown a fantastic capacity to recover from setbacks and there's reason to believe in his ability to do the same again now, but there was a weariness at Hampden. \"It was a kick up the backside,\" said McGinn. But why was it needed?\nThere were more boos at full-time but a fair number of supporters had vanished by then. It would be too dramatic to say their optimism of making the World Cup also disappeared, but the fact is Greece are in Scotland's group and they have now done a proper psychological number on Scotland before those games in the autumn. Clarke said as much in the aftermath.\nHe has some months to ponder things now, a window in which to consider his next move. He suggested he regretted not changing his team a little more from Thursday to Sunday. He spoke about freshness, or lack of it. \"I'll go away and look at myself,\" he said.\nWhat might he be thinking about? The safe return of Ben Doak to add width and pace, for sure. The desperately needed reintroduction of Aaron Hickey after his awful injury woes, without question.\nClarke is deeply loyal to the players who have delivered for him, but Scott McKenna is playing in La Liga every week.  The composition of his midfield, too. Kenny McLean has been a tremendous servant but the time has surely come for Ferguson to take over.\nRelegation to League B is, in itself, no great disaster. Scotland will win more games down there. They'll have a better chance of grabbing a play-off place in the next Euros while operating in less rarefied air.\nThe thing that made Sunday stunning was the complete disintegration of a team we thought had more about them. That was the takeaway. Clarke has been here before, but the hope was he would never be back here again.",

Characters such as Viktor Hovland, who dragged himself from apparent golfing oblivion to become the latest winner on the PGA Tour.\nThis out of the blue success was an astonishing turnaround of form and fortune.\n\"It's like you keep drowning and you're running out of air,\" the 27-year-old Norwegian said of his recent travails after beating Justin Thomas in the Valspar Championship last Sunday to land yet another European victory on American soil this year.\nHovland's late surge secures Valspar Championship victory\nEngland's Mansell wins maiden DP Tour title\nEngland's Rhodes holds nerve to claim maiden LET victory\nIt is fair to say Hovland's success was among the least expected in a series of 2025 wins that will surely cheer European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald. This was the Oslo born star's first win since the 2023 Tour Championship.\nThen he was ranked the fourth best player on the world, someone who possessed an unorthodox but highly effective swing and who had solved his problems around the green, seemingly the only aspect holding him back.\nIn short, he looked a complete player, one ready to start winning majors and capable of becoming a dominant figure. The finished article.\nYet, there is no such thing in this game. The pursuit for better never ends and capriciously it brings no guarantees of improvement.\nThere are those who say \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  Rory McIlroy used that very phrase talking about aspects of his own game in the wake of his recent play-off win at the Players Championship.\nBut Hovland most certainly does not fall into that category.\n\"I find it kind of weird that we're professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, 'oh he's a perfectionist, he's out on the perimeter searching too much',\" he commented.\n\"That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments. So if you're not going to try to get better, what are you doing?\"\nThis from a player who had the world at his feet, only to then make a string of swing changes while emulating the Watford FC approach to hiring and firing coaches.\nIn the 574 days that followed his Tour Championship victory, Hovland slumped from first to 137th on the tour's FedEx Cup standings. He had missed the cut in his previous three outings, including starting the Players with a ruinous 80.\nBut the golfer believed the constant tinkering, the pursuit of perfection, to be entirely justified. \"It's not like I'm inventing stuff,\" he said.\nBut what he did realise was that he needed to go back to feels and methods that had previously worked. \"I have data that can show that what I used to do was objectively better than what I'm doing now.\n\"So why shouldn't I try to go back to what I used to do?\"\nHe reconnected with former coach Grant Waite while still pondering whether it was worth heading to Tampa for the tournament he ultimately won. \"I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week,\" Hovland admitted.\nBetween them they found an old feel on the range last Tuesday. It had been lost in pursuit for more speed and its rediscovery was a vital building block.\n\"He's really hard on himself,\" Hovland's caddie Shay Knight told PGATour.com. \"But as soon as he finds some little swing cue or thought, he tends to take it on board, and it happens really fast.\n\"And it just seemed to click; I knew something special was going to happen this week with the swing thought.\"\nHovland was far from perfect and still fearful of losing long shots high and right, but he had a foundation to make him competitive. \"Incredibly, I did make it work and was able to win and I think that is something that I'm extremely proud of,\" he smiled.\nThe game remains \"more stressful than it should be\" but he feels reuniting with Waite, a former tour player, will lead to more success.\n\"He's definitely put his heart and soul into looking at all the different golf swings that I've sent him,\" Hovland said.\n\"It's challenging because I have a very unique pattern and it's unconventional and I would say most coaches probably would like to make my swing more conventional and hopefully try to fix the problem.\n\"But that's not really how my golf swing works. And I really trust Grant, because he he sees it and knows what kind of matchups need to be there for it to work.\"\nHovland's win follows two PGA Tour victories for Northern Ireland's McIlroy already this year as well as big wins for Swede Ludvig Aberg, Austria's Sepp Straka and Belgium's Thomas Detry.\nThese results fuel optimism for a successful Ryder Cup defence for Europe at Bethpage in September. But do not get carried away.\nBack in 2023 Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Sam Burns were posting victories at this time of year, while Brooks Koepka, Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman landed majors. But the US team were soundly beaten in Rome.\nThere are no guarantees in the sport that Rotella, who has advised a string of major winners, insists is not \"a game of perfect\".  So it should not be a surprise that even Hovland's short-term hopes for next month's Masters are tempered.\n\"Some of the shots that I'm hitting, it's going to make it really difficult for me to be in contention at Augusta,\" he admitted.\n\"You're going to hit so many long irons into par-four holes and you've got to drive it pretty far because the fairways are pretty wide.\n\"It's more of a bomber's paradise versus this place (Copperhead in Tampa) where it's more just about being precise off the tee.\n\"So there's still some things that I need to improve, but luckily we've got two weeks and this is certainly nice to have in the back of my mind leading up to Augusta.\"",

Another was winning Olympic gold aged 19. Another was committing muggings at 15.\nThe 20-something version of Foreman was one-third of heavyweight boxing's \"holy trinity\", with Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. The 45-year-old version would become boxing's oldest heavyweight world champion.\nHe was once marked to be another poor kid from Texas, lost to America's wasteland, but instead rose to be one of the most recognisable faces on the planet.\nForeman's powers of transformation served him well in a sporting career brimming with prestige and drama.\n'Big' George Foreman, who has died aged 76, leaves behind a professional legacy that many boxers today could only dream of replicating. He had 81 fights, 76 wins and just five losses.\nHe was twice the heavyweight champion of the world. He fought Frazier, Ken Norton and Ali. His longevity was such that he even faced a 28-year-old Evander Holyfield.\nHis legacy was forged in the Rumble in the Jungle, his haunting of Frazier and his impossible achievement aged 45.\nForeman secured his spot in the halls of heavyweight greatness many times over.\n\"I am sure he is in every argument for the greatest heavyweights of all time,\" 5 Live Boxing analyst Steve Bunce said.\n\"He had 76 wins and I don't often do stats and facts but 68 ended by knockout.\n\"I haven't done the research to tell you how many times he dropped men, but I will say of his 76 wins he probably dropped his opponent about 200 times in total.\n\"If Big George hit you, you stayed hit. It was as simple as that.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'A larger than life star' - Foreman dies age 76\nHeavyweight boxing legend Foreman dies aged 76\nForeman's life in pictures\nThe Rumble in the Jungle - 50 years on\nForeman was born in Marshall, Texas, 10 January 1949. He was one of six siblings and took the name of his stepfather, JD Foreman, rather than his birth father.\nBy his own admission, Foreman was a troubled kid struggling in an environment designed to keep him disenfranchised and angry.\nHe started mugging people by the age of 15.\n\"I've always been motivated by food, because I was always hungry,\" he said. \"There never was enough food to eat for me, for various reasons.\"\nHis mother, Nancy, convinced him to join the Job Corps aged 16. He earned his GED,, external and learned to be a carpenter and bricklayer, but in a pivotal moment for his life, he was introduced to boxing by a coach called Doc Broadus.\nForeman arrived at the 1968 Olympics aged 19 and with just 25 amateur fights under his belt. He bulldozed the competition, winning gold.\n\"Less than two years prior to the date that I'd stood on that platform receiving gold and listening to the national anthem, I was under a house, hiding from the police,\" he said later.\n\"I climbed from underneath that house, in mud and slop, and said to myself: 'I'm going to do something in my life, I'm not a thief.'\"\nRemembering George Foreman: The Rumble in the Jungle\nTributes pour in for heavyweight icon Foreman\nHear Foreman on This Sporting Life in 2020\nFrazier (left) was 29-0 when he met Foreman, who was 37-0\nForeman's Olympic triumph cleared a path into the pro ranks. He had 13 fights in his first year as a pro, with 11 knockouts. By 1972, he was 37-0 and the clear contender to the heavyweight champion Frazier.\nFrazier had beaten Ali. He was the top dog in the division. Foreman was a 4-1 underdog when they met in Kingston, Jamaica in January 1973.\nForeman knocked Frazier down six times in two rounds to become the WBA, WBC and lineal heavyweight champion.\nThe win completely altered the heavyweight landscape at the time. Foreman was only 24.\n\"That is the fight where he famously lifts Joe Frazier off the ground with an uppercut. That is George Foreman,\" Bunce said.\nForeman would say later Frazier was the only man he ever \"feared\" and how the victory changed his life overnight.\n\"One day you're no-one and the next day everyone wants to take advantage of you,\" he said.\nForeman was a big favourite against Muhammad Ali\nIt is hard to explain just how iconic the 'Rumble in the Jungle' is. If there was a room of statues representing the greatest fights, it would be there in the centre, along with the two seminal bouts between Ali and Frazier.\nIt was a fight that encapsulated everything boxing was, and still is. The sublime and the downright grime.\nIt was staged in Zaire on 30 October 1974, funded by the brutal dictatorship in control there at the time.\nAli, a massive underdog, had cast himself as the charismatic good guy and Foreman the brutish villain. It would be staged at 04:00 local time so some 50 million people could tune in across the world.\nA suspected 26 million people watched in the UK, out of a population of 56 million.\nForeman was expected to crush Ali. Instead Ali produced a classic performance, soaking up pressure for seven rounds. Debuting his 'rope-a-dope' style on the ropes, he slowly drained Foreman of his powers.\nIn the eighth round, Ali pounced. He dropped Foreman, who was not allowed to beat the count by the referee, thus bringing to a close one of the biggest upsets in world championship boxing.\nAfter his first loss in 41 fights, Foreman took two years out of the ring.\n\"From pride to pity, that was devastating,\" Foreman said of the loss.\nForeman complained the ropes had been loosened, that his trainer had even drugged him. He campaigned for a rematch but never got it. But once Ali called time on his career, he and Foreman became close friends.\nForeman famously helped a Parkinson-afflicted Ali climb the steps to receive an Oscar for the When We Were Kings documentary in 1996, which told the story of their showdown 22 years previously.\n\"Foreman was part of that holy trinity of heavyweight boxers, with Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier,\" boxing promoter Frank Warren said.\n\"The great fights they had between them were special times for boxing and world sport. \n\"They're events that have gone down not just in boxing, but significant moments in the world of sport.\"\nThis video can not be played\n Foreman relives the Rumble in the Jungle\nForeman had two impressive wins over fellow great Joe Frazier\nAt 27, Foreman got back in the ring to fight Frazier for a second time. They each received a $1m fight purse.\nOn 15 June 1976, Foreman crushed a 32-year-old Frazier for a second time, stopping him in the fifth.\nDuring the US TV broadcast, commentator Howard Cosell summed up the performance: \"George Foreman: Too big. Too strong. In perfect shape. The punches crisp from the very beginning.\"\nForeman was seemingly on top of the world again, though three fights later he would lose to Jimmy Young on points in a sluggish performance in Puerto Rico.\nAfter the fight, Foreman said he had a \"near-death experience\" in the dressing as he struggled with exhaustion and heatstroke. \nForeman said in that moment he became a believer in God. He retired from boxing aged 28 and became an ordained minister.\nForeman's famed punching power helped him achieve history at the age of 45\nTen years later, Foreman shocked the boxing world by announcing his comeback.\nHe returned initially because his George Foreman youth centre was in financial crisis but would rack up 24 wins between 1987 and 1991.\n\"Everybody laughed, and I listened to them laugh,\" Foreman told the BBC later. He faced Holyfield in April 1991 for the WBA, WBC and IBF heavyweight world titles.\nHolyfield would beat a 42-year-old Foreman, seemingly ending an impossible mission to become world champion again. \nHe tried again, losing on points to Tommy Morrison in 1993 - but was given the chance to fight WBA and IBF champion Michael Moorer next.\nWhen Foreman became world champion\nFellow American Moorer was cruising through the encounter before eating a right hand from Foreman in the 10th round.\nThe punch made Foreman the oldest heavyweight champion in history at 45. He narrowly retained the title against Axel Schulz in his next bout.\nHe would fight three more times in non-world title fights, before finally bringing the curtain down on his professional career in 1997 at the age of 48 following a points loss to Shannon Briggs.\n\"It was a great challenge for me to fight and fight, and when the time was up, I was happy about it.\" \nIn 2022, two women filed lawsuits in the United States accusing him of sexual abuse in the 1970s.\nOne accused Foreman of grooming her when she was eight and having sex with her when she was 15.\nThe other accused him of sexually abusing and raping her when she was 15 and 16-years-old.\nIn March 2024, Foreman launched a countersuit, asking one of the lawsuits be thrown out.\nForeman \"adamantly and categorically\" denied the allegations.\nHe remained a household name in retirement.

        "article_text": "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered an urgent investigation into the power outage caused by a substation fire that shut Heathrow Airport on Friday.\nThe investigation, led by the National Energy System Operator (NESO), would build a \"clear picture\" of the incident and UK's energy resilience more broadly to prevent it \"from ever happening again\", the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said.\n\"We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned,\" Miliband said.\nThe fire at the North Hyde substation in west London that supplies power to the airport led to thousands of cancelled flights on Friday and stranded passengers across the world.\nOn Sunday Heathrow said it would be operating \"another full schedule\" with more than 1,300 flights after more than 250,000 passengers passed through the airport on Saturday. \n\"We have welcomed the Government's announcement of an investigation into the cause and response to the off-airport power outage and have launched a review, to be chaired by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly, of Heathrow's response,\" a statement from the airport added. \nMore than 63,000 homes lost power in the outage caused by the fire, according to energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. About 150 people were evacuated from surrounding properties.\nThe Met Police has said that counter-terrorism officers were \"leading inquiries\" but are not treating the incident as suspicious.\nMiliband said he has commissioned the investigation to \"understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future\".\nNESO, which operates Britain's electricity grid, is expected to report to the power regulator Ofgem and the government in six weeks with its initial findings.\nNearly 1,400 flights were disrupted by the airport's closure, according to air traffic website flightradar24.com. Around 120 flights were diverted elsewhere.\nSeparately, Heathrow has announced a review of the airport's response to the power outage and its crisis management plans will be undertaken by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly.\nThe airport said it was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, but the chaos has raised questions about the resilience of the major transport hub.\nFifty slots were added to Saturday's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through it, the airport said.\nOn Saturday, more than 30 flights due to depart from the airport were cancelled and more than 15 were delayed, according to Heathrow's live departure board.\nIt also showed that more than 70 flights expected to arrive at the airport had been cancelled, including from Doha, Riyadh, Dubai, Manchester, and Newcastle Upon Tyne.\nFarah Rafeeq was due to travel with a friend from Heathrow to Cambodia on Friday to attend a friend's wedding but the mass cancellation of flights has meant she will miss part of the ceremony.\nThe 24-year-old found an alternative flight from Gatwick Airport that will get them to Cambodia for Sunday afternoon in time for the wedding reception but said they had to pay \"double the amount\" for a the new flight.\nIn Miami, Charlotte and her family were heading to Heathrow on Thursday night when their American Airlines plane was \"turned around mid-flight\", she said.\n\"I have been stranded in Miami with my infant one year-old and three year-old son since then,\" she told the BBC.\nShe said the family had been \"passed around from hotel to hotel\", but now hopes to be booked on a flight on Sunday.\nAn American Airlines spokesperson said it has been \"working around the clock to get customers on their way\" to Heathrow \"as quickly and efficiently as possible\", adding that it was providing overnight accommodation to passengers affected by the airport's closure.\nSubstations, operated by National Grid, are designed to produce, convert, and distribute electricity at suitable voltage levels. Heathrow uses three electricity substations, each with a backup.\nThere are also backup diesel generators, and uninterruptible battery-powered supplies which provide enough power to keep safety critical systems such as aircraft landing systems running.\nHowever, when the fire broke out the substation, it was out of action, along with its backup.\nHeathrow's main fall-back was the two remaining substations, but the airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, told the BBC that it \"takes time\" to \"switch them\".\nHe said the incident was \"not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences\".\nIn a statement released on Saturday evening, Mr Woldbye welcomed the investigation, saying that \"we will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident\".\nHeathrow's chairman Lord Paul Deighton said the airport regrets the disruption caused and hopes people affected \"understand that the decision was made in order to prioritise the safety of our passengers and colleagues\".\nHe added that the airport is \"committed to finding any potential learnings from this unprecedented incident\" when its review is conducted.\nAdditional reporting by Kris Bramwell.

The airport said it hoped \"to run a full operation\" on Saturday,\nMore than 1,300 flights were affected, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers have been told not to travel to the airport unless their airline has advised them to. \nThe National Grid said earlier that an \"interim solution\" has been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network has been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added when the power outage happened the back up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nPassengers were urged not to travel to the airport unless their airline had advised them to do so on Friday.\nThe airport is hoping to run a normal service on Saturday, Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye said.\nThe travel disruption affected many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nThe National Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.\nIn the meantime, customers have been told not to go to the airport unless their airline has advised them to.\nBut Mr Woldbye said the airport would be \"back in full operation\" on Saturday.",

        "article_text": "Scenes playing out in Nigeria during holiday periods could be in a movie: emotional reunions at airport terminals, champagne flowing like water in high-end clubs and A-list Afrobeats performers dominating stages to packed audiences nationwide.\nThis is when Nigerians abroad return for a visit to the home country. They are nicknamed I Just Got Back (IJGB) and bring with them more than full suitcases.\nTheir Western accents dip in and out of Pidgin, their wallets are boosted by the exchange rate, and their presence fuels the economy.\nBut it also highlights an uncomfortable truth.\nThose who live in Nigeria, earning in the local naira currency, feel shut out of their own cities, especially in the economic hub of Lagos and the capital, Abuja, as prices go up during festive periods.\nResidents say this is particularly the case for \"Detty December\", a term used to refer the celebrations around Christmas and New Year.\nDetty December makes Lagos almost unliveable for locals - traffic is horrible, prices inflate and businesses stop prioritising their regular customers, a radio presenter based in Lagos tells the BBC.\nThe popular media personality asked not to be named for voicing what some might consider controversial opinions.\nBut he is not the only one to hold these views and has some are pondering, with Easter and the diaspora summer holiday season approaching, whether the IJGBs are helping bridge Nigeria's class divide or are making it even wider.\n\"Nigeria is very classist. Ironically, we're a poor country, so it's a bit silly,\" the radio presenter adds.\n\"The wealth gap is massive. It's almost like we're worlds apart.\"\nIt is true that despite oil-rich Nigeria being one of Africa's biggest economies and the continent's most populous country, its more than 230 million citizens face huge challenges and limited opportunities.\nAt the beginning of the year, the charity Oxfam warned the wealth gap in Nigeria was reaching a \"crisis level\".\nStatistics from 2023 are startling. \nAccording to the World Inequality Database more than 10% of the population owned more than 60% of Nigeria's wealth. For those with jobs, 10% of the population took home 42% of the income.\nThe World Bank says the figure of those living below the poverty line is 87 million - \"the world's second-largest poor population after India\". \nMartins Ifeanacho, professor of sociology at the University of Port Harcourt, says this gap and resulting class divide has grown since Nigeria's independence from the UK in 1960.\n\"We've gone through so much economic hardship,\" the academic, who returned to Nigeria after studying in Ireland in the 1990s, tells the BBC.\nHe points the finger at the greed of those who are in position of political power - be it at a federal or state level.\n\"We have a political elite that bases its calculations on how to acquire power, amass wealth for the purpose of capturing more power.\n\"The ordinary people are left out of the equation, and that's why there is a lot of hardship.\"\nBut it is not just about money in the bank account.\nWealth, real or perceived, can dictate access, status and opportunity - and the presence of the diaspora can magnify the class divide.\n\"Nigeria's class system is hard to pinpoint. It's not just about money, it's about perception,\" explains the radio presenter.\nHe gives the example of going out for a meal in Lagos and how peacocking is so important.\nAt restaurants, those arriving in a Range Rover are quickly attended to, while those in a Kia may be ignored, says the radio presenter.\nSocial mobility is difficult when the nation's wealth remains within a small elite.\nWith odds stacked against those trying to climb the ladder, for many Nigerians the only realistic path to a better life is to leave.\nThe World Bank blames \"weak job creation and entrepreneurial prospects\" that stifle the absorption of \"the 3.5 million Nigerians entering the labour force every year\".\n\"Many workers choose to emigrate in search of better opportunities,\" it says.\nSince the 1980s, middle-class Nigerians have sought opportunities abroad, but in recent years, the urgency has intensified, especially among Gen Z and millennials.\nThis mass exodus has been dubbed \"japa\", a Yoruba word meaning \"to escape\".\nA 2022 survey found that at least 70% of young Nigerians would relocate if they could.\nBut for many, leaving is not simple. Studying abroad, the most common route, can cost tens of thousands of dollars, not including travel, accommodation and visa expenses.\n\"Japa creates this aspirational culture where people now want to leave the country,\" says Lulu Okwara, a 28-year-old recruitment officer.\nShe went the UK to study finance in 2021 - and is one of the IJGBs, having returned to Nigeria at least three times since moving.\nMs Okwara notes that in Nigeria there is a pressure to succeed. A culture where achievement is expected.\n\"It's success or nothing,\" she tells the BBC. \"There is no room for failure.\"\nThis deeply embedded sentiment makes people feel they must do anything to succeed.\nEspecially for those who come from more working-class backgrounds. The IJGBs have a point to prove.\n\"When people go out there, their dream is always to come back as heroes, mostly during Christmas or other festivities,\" says Prof Ifeanacho.\n\"You come back home and you mix with your people that you've missed for a long time.\n\"The type of welcome they will give to you, the children that will be running to you, is something that you love and cherish.\"\nSuccess is chased at any cost and putting on a foreign accent can help you climb Nigeria's social ladder - even if you have not been abroad.\n\"People fake accents to get access. The more you sound British, the higher your social status,\" says Prof Ifeanacho.\nHe recalls a story about a pastor who preached every Sunday on the radio.\n\"When they told me that this man had not left Nigeria, I said, 'No, that's not possible.' Because when you hear him speak, everything is American,\" he says in disbelief.\nAmerican and British accents, especially, act as a different kind of currency, smoothing paths in both professional and social settings.\nPushback on social media suggests some IJGBs are all front - they may lap up the returning hero adulation but in fact lack financial clout.\nBizzle Osikoya, the owner at The Plug Entertainment, a business that hosts live music events in West Africa, says he has encountered some issues that reflect this.\nHe tells the BBC about how several IJGBs have attended his events - but who have gone on to try and get their money back.\n\"They went back to the US and Canada and put a dispute on their payments,\" he says.\nThis may reflect the desperate effort to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of success in a society where every display of wealth is scrutinised.\nIn Nigeria, it seems, performance is key - and the IJGBs who are able to show off will certainly be able to climb the class ladder.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "\"If you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox\": with that advice in an exclusive BBC interview, the hugely popular gaming platform's CEO Dave Baszucki ignited a fierce debate among parents.\nMr Baszucki also stressed the company took protecting its users extremely seriously  and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on what is the UK's most popular gaming site for children aged eight to 12.\nHundreds of people got in touch with the BBC after reading his comments: many said parents needed to take more responsibility, or highlighted how safe and enjoyable Roblox was for their children.\nOthers painted a much darker picture - accusations of grooming, addiction and a company that failed to respond to their concerns.\nHere are some of their stories. The BBC has changed some names to protect the identities of young people.\nFor Amir, from Leeds, Mr Baszucki's comments were \"ridiculous\", and the course of action he suggested was \"much easier said than done\". \n\"Roblox is ruining my son\", he told the BBC - and he feels powerless to stop it.\nA user since he was eight or nine, he says the 15-year-old is \"addicted\" and can now use the site for up to 14 hours a day.\n\"He is a single child and both parents are so busy working. I feel guilty we haven't been able to give him quality time. That's been robbed by Roblox,\" Amir told the BBC.\nThe son's account is linked to the father's email address, and Amir has received \"hundreds\" of emails over the years from Roblox about the violation of the 'terms of use'.\nHe says his son has been given temporary bans, but finds a way to play on - using multiple accounts and the accounts of others. \nAmir hopes he can reduce his son's time on the platform by \"playing cards, talking and watching YouTube together\" rather than forcing him off the platform completely.\nIn response, Roblox highlighted to BBC News the screen time limit feature on the platform that gives parents the ability to restrict the amount of time children are allowed to spend on Roblox each day.\nSally, from the north of Scotland, told the BBC she \"fully takes responsibility\" as a parent - but questioned whether Roblox was doing the same.\nShe told the BBC her nine-year-old daughter was being groomed on Roblox and - despite reporting it to the platform - did not get a response, leaving her \"enraged\".\nThe mother said last December her child was chatting to someone in a game where you can \"mimic real life\". This user coerced her child to role play \"marriage\". They told the girl they were touching themselves, and asked Sally's daughter to touch herself and take a photo.\nThey offered Roblox's in-game currency in exchange for the picture. The child didn't do it, and told her mother days later.\n\"When she approached me, it was with a lot of tears, and feeling very, very shameful with what had happened. I assured my child that it's not their fault that they have done everything correct - to tell me.\n\"This is unacceptable for a platform that's advertised towards young children. It seems like the company isn't taking any responsibility and clearly their filters are not working.\"\nSally said companies that created platforms should be liable for any issues with them, rather than telling its users \"'well, don't use it'.\"\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Baszucki said building a \"trust and safety system\" had been an important part of Roblox ever since it launched. \nHe added: \"We do, in the company, take the attitude that any bad - even one bad incident - is one too many.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nHe said he remained confident in Roblox's safety tools and insisted the firm went above and beyond to keep its users safe.\nRoblox also says it analyses all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so - and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIt stressed to BBC News that users cannot share images with each other on the platform. \nConcerns about children being exposed to sexual content on Roblox have been aired before.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned on the platform from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players. Other parental controls were also introduced.\nMany people have also contacted the BBC to endorse what the Roblox CEO said.\nKathryn Foley said she was \"impressed\" with Mr Baszuki's \"honesty\" in his interview, and highlighted ongoing conversations she has with her nine-year-old daughter, Helene, about the platform.\nHelene is a big fan of the animal game Adopt Me.\n\"I would say on the whole the Roblox experience has been a very positive one with Adopt Me being a very kind and safe place for her to have fun with her friends,\" Kathryn said.\nMeanwhile, Kirsty Solman spoke to the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2 about her 13-year-old son Kyle, who has ADHD, autism and severe anxiety. \n\"He really struggles with social interactions and small talk. Being on Roblox and other gaming platforms, he is then able to play with his classmates.\n\"That stress and anxiety is taken away, and he has ended up with a really good group of friends.\"\nKirsty said she spoke to her son about online safety and checks his devices every day.\nPhil from London agreed parents needed to take the initiative when it came to online safety.\n\"There is a danger in thinking the internet is a cr\u00e8che,\" he commented on the BBC website.",

Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.\n\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"\nThe impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.\nAnd Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.\nPatrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".\n\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.\nFormer subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.\nMr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.\nSpence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.\nSpence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.\nFigures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for \u00a3598m, down 22% on the previous year.\nKosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.\nBut with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?\nIn February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\".\nOn Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was \"at risk of losing the very stories that define us\".\n\"We are in the 45th minute of the pilot episode, and we've got five minutes left to stop the bomb from going off,\" she said.\nShe recently told a House of Commons committee she would like to see an uplift in tax relief for high end television, similar to the one already given to the film sector.",

If they're not looked after they will fall down and parts of them have fallen down in the past. \n\"They are resting on clay and the clay settles. So if you don't attend to the settling and make sure the cracks are addressed, they will tumble down.\"\nHe believes donations from other attractions can raise between \u00a35,000 and \u00a350,000 a year depending on the footfall. \nA successful example is the Diocese of York, which raises 80% of its donations from such points.\n\"It's worth trying to see how it goes,\" Bill adds.\nOfficers at York City Council have recommended approving the proposal at a cost of \u00a35,000 and it will be discussed by councillors at a meeting on 25 March.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

        "article_text": "Flights around the world have been disrupted after Heathrow Airport closed due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation.\nHeathrow, the UK's busiest airport, said on Friday afternoon that they will \"restart\" some flights later after the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London. The airport said it hoped \"to run a full operation\" on Saturday,\nMore than 1,300 flights were affected, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers have been told not to travel to the airport unless their airline has advised them to. \nThe National Grid said earlier that an \"interim solution\" has been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network has been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added when the power outage happened the back up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nPassengers were urged not to travel to the airport unless their airline had advised them to do so on Friday.\nThe airport is hoping to run a normal service on Saturday, Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye said.\nThe travel disruption affected many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening.

        "article_text": "Thomas Tuchel's England reign is off to a winning start\nEngland's new head coach Thomas Tuchel slid into his technical area almost unnoticed after the deafening fanfare that greeted the start of his reign at Wembley.\nHe missed fireworks, pyrotechnics, a deafening drum-and-bass track commissioned in his honour by the Football Association entitled \"Thomas Tuchel's Army\", plus a giant banner stretching across one end of the stadium welcoming him to \"The Home of Football\".\nTuchel's own entrance was a low-key affair, setting the tone for a low-key occasion for Gareth Southgate's successor. The excitement and intensity the German promised will have to wait for another day after this scrappy 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Albania.\nIn an unflattering review of England's Euro 2024 campaign - widely interpreted as criticism of Southgate and the team beaten by Spain in the final - Tuchel claimed it was missing \"intensity, clarity, identity, repetition of patterns, expression of players and hunger\".\nIn this game, at least, there was little to distinguish Tuchel's England from Southgate's, his search for thrills thwarted by Albania's lack of ambition, a reluctance to leave their own half and his own team's lack of fluency and rhythm.\nA win is a win, however, and this is what Tuchel has been appointed to do, in the short-term against Albania and Latvia here on Monday - and in the long-term at next year's World Cup.\nFive talking points from Tuchel's first game as England boss\n'He does everything right' - the remarkable rise of Lewis-Skelly\nWho 'didn't show enough' against Albania? How England's players rated\nTuchel went for a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Manchester City's Phil Foden on the right and on-loan Aston Villa attacker Marcus Rashford on the left, which did not prove a roaring success.\nAfter the game England's new boss said \"we hope for more impact in these positions\" and that \"they were not as decisive as they can be\".\nBut the decision to give Arsenal left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly a debut was a masterstroke as he became the youngest player to score on his senior England debut, aged 18 years and 176 days.\nDan Burn, another making his first appearance at 32, almost repeated his goalscoring feats for Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool when he headed against the bar in the first half, but looked laboured and vulnerable when Albania substitute Armando Broja ran at him late on.\nTuchel laid down his template by insisting he wants more intensity, more touches in the opponents' box and more ball recoveries in the opponents' half. By this measure there is work to do, but this is early days.\nEngland had 34 touches in Albania's box compared to 44 in interim manager Lee Carsley's last game against the Republic of Ireland in November, winning back possession in the final third four times as opposed to six, enjoying 74.2% possession against 73.6%.\nThis should all be placed in the context of an Albanian strategy which effectively consisted of building the lowest of blocks to frustrate England.\nIt is too early to detect any sort of identity as, in many ways, this was more of the same that went before, but it was easy to detect what Tuchel likes and wants from his body language.\nThis video can not be played\nTuchel happy with start but England must be 'more dangerous'\nIn the opening stages, he twice broke into animated applause when England pressurised Albania into errors - the first occasion when they stole possession and on another when intensity forced the visitors to pass the ball into touch.\nTuchel was equally enthusiastic when England pounced to pinch the ball back. This was the intensity he wanted and will expect more of in the future. \nIt was all accompanied by tic-tac arm-waving, but mostly he was a calm, measured figure, although there was little to get excited about for long spells.\nTuchel was not a permanent presence on the touchline, taking his seat after 14 minutes, remaining there for three minutes, occasionally in discussion with his staff, before returning pitch-side.\nHe greeted the first goal of his reign, slipped home by Lewis-Skelly from Jude Bellingham's incisive pass, with a pump of his fist and a big smile - but it was quickly down to business as he delivered some lengthy instructions to goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\nTuchel also soon became acquainted with one of Wembley's more recent traditions, the paper aeroplanes that fly during periods of inactivity. The first one landed near him after 33 minutes.\nTuchel has shown he is not too proud to use the physical presence and set-piece prowess he believes bring the strengths of the Premier League to England, selecting the physicality and aerial power of 6ft 7in Burn ahead of the more technically gifted Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi, who was arguably England's best performer at the Euros.\nWhen the Three Lions won three successive corners in the first half, a line of players formed - a ploy known variously as \"the bus stop\" or \"the love train\" - but there was only one target for Declan Rice's delivery - the giant figure of Burn.\nIt was the most obvious of plans, but almost worked as he rose above Albania's defenders to crash a header against the bar.\nTuchel only lost his composure once, when he berated the officials for not awarding a foul when Rashford was barged to the ground in front of him, but this was an uneventful night and a routine win.\nNo serious clues were offered about any revolutionary moves Tuchel might have up his sleeve, although he will yearn for a swift return to fitness for Bukayo Saka given Foden's disappointing performance in the position the Arsenal winger would normally occupy.\nOne area Tuchel is keen to develop is the \"interactions\" between England's players on the field, effectively moments where they encourage each other, showing a bond of togetherness.\nWhen he addressed the players at St George's Park on Monday, he presented them with data that showed there were 60 such interactions in the first half of the Euros final against Spain in Berlin, but only 35 after half-time when they conceded the goals that saw them slip to a 2-1 defeat.\nThis was not a night when interactions or high-fives were the order of the day. It was more a simple case of 'job done'. Although Pickford did celebrate - and at great length with much enthusiasm - when defender Ezri Konsa pulled off a superb covering tackle as Albania's Jasir Asani raced through with the chance of an unlikely equaliser.\nTuchel's plain speaking is already a contrast to the measured, almost diplomatic, words of Southgate and he made his feelings clear once more when he said: \"We can do better, we have to do better.\"\nWhen it was all over, the first three points secured, Tuchel made a swift exit down Wembley's tunnel, leaving his players to conduct a lap of appreciation - although thousands of fans had drifted away well before the end.\nThis was not a night that carried the air of a glorious new era, but Tuchel has been brought to England with a simple brief - win.",

        "article_text": "Like most of us, guitarist Raymond Meade had a slow and quiet summer in 2021.\nThe pandemic had put a stop to live touring with Ocean Colour Scene, with whom he had played since 2016.\nAnd without recording studios, he was unable to continue with his successful solo career.\nBut there was a further barrier for the bassist, who has been playing since he was in school.\n\"I'd started to get these really intense pins and needles in my hands. It was like throwing a snowball and then running your hands under hot water afterwards. It's really painful and hot.\"\n\"And then it spread to my feet.\"\nIn August that year, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) which affects the central nervous system.\n\"It was almost a relief to have the diagnosis because it allowed me to make the necessary adjustments and get on with my life.\"\nBut he was also concerned that his professional career might be over.\n\"The day they told me I had MS, I thought I was done. I wasn't even 40 at that point and I thought I'd have to sell my guitars and find some other way to make a living.\n\"But the neurologist said, 'Give it time'.\"\nWithin two months, he was on a new treatment, and ready to leave hospital.\nOcean Colour Scene had just announced their first tour in almost two years \u2013 and Meade was keen to be part of it.\n\"My hands didn't work. I couldn't tie my laces. I couldn't do a zip up - I was dropping everything. \n\"To have something to aim for was important.\"\nHe called the other band members - Simon Fowler, Steve Cradock and Oscar Harrison - and told them what had happened.\n\"I said I was aware that I might not get back to the level of being able to perform live, but they just said 'Get fit, see you in December'.\"\nThe gig in the band's home city of Birmingham was an emotional one, for them and the audience.\nBut Meade was just focused on getting through the set.\n\"I had a stool hidden behind an amp and I thought if I can get through this without sitting down, I'll be doing ok.\nIn the end I didn't need it. And there was this outpouring of emotion. It was such a terrible time and it was a release to get back to playing live music.\"\n\"We all had a hug when we came off stage.\"\nHaving returned to live touring, Meade had another challenge to face. Making his own music.\n\"I couldn't hold a pen \u2013 which means I can't do my crossword either. My head was just scrambled with too much information. I made the mistake of googling MS and I was just swamped with information. \n\"The thing to remember is that no one - with my brain - has ever had this before so I needed to find out what's right for me.\"\nHe started to train his brain with games like chess, and slowly the songwriting abilities returned.\nThe result is his first new single since his diagnosis, Holy Water, which has been released on Alan McGee's new label Creation Youth.\nFor a boy who grew up in the southside of Glasgow, idolising Oasis, and later ran Liam Gallagher's clothes label Pretty Green, it was a dream moment.\n\"I used to send him demo cassettes. It's a full circle moment. And to be writing again and to have that music released by Alan McGee meant everything.\"\n\"I'd never thought I'd get back to playing with the band and writing my own music, being able to record it and being at a level that Alan McGee finds it worthy of releasing.\"\nThis week he and the rest of Ocean Colour Scene kick off their latest tour in Leeds. The band whose hits include The Riverboat Song and The Day We Caught the Train will play two dates at Glasgow's 02 Academy on 15 and 16 April.\nAnother dream come true for the boy who saw the band as a teenager at the Glasgow Barrowlands.\nAnd he's planning it carefully.\n\"My neurologist said you need to think when you wake up that you have an allocation of energy tokens and be careful how you use them. I'm an expert napper. If I'm doing something in the evening, I lay off in the day to balance the fatigue. It's manageable.\"\n\"I found out that the actress Jamie Linn Sigler from the Sopranos had MS all the way through the show. It didn't stop her. I get fans coming up all the time to say their mum, or their uncle has MS.\n\"I want to be an example that it's not the end if you get it. It's manageable. Lean on the MS nurses. You can carry on with your life. You can still be you.\"",
