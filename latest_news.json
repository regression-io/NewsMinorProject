        "article_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma joined Paris St-Germain in 2021\nIt is the life of a goalkeeper. \nOne day you are the villain. The next, you are the hero.\nGianluigi Donnarumma was blamed by some for Paris St-Germain's defeat by Liverpool last week, allowing Harvey Elliot's 88th-minute effort - the Reds' only shot on target - to slip in. \nAt the other end, the Italian's opposite number Alisson produced the \"performance of his career\" as he single-handedly kept the French side at bay in Paris. \nOn Tuesday night, the tables turned.\nItaly's Donnarumma was the hero, saving two of Liverpool's three penalties in a shootout to send his side through to the Champions League quarter-finals. \n\"The first game belonged to Alisson, the second game belonged to Donnarumma,\" said PSG boss Luis Enrique.\nDonnarumma has now won six of the seven penalty shootouts he has taken part in for club and country.\nSince making his debut aged 16 for boyhood club AC Milan, Donnarumma has faced 60 penalties across his club and international career. \nHe has saved 14 of those, giving him a save percentage of 23.3%.\nRemarkably, the Italian's penalty shootout record is identical.\nThe 26-year-old has saved 10 of the 43 spot-kicks he has faced during shootouts - a save percentage of 23.3%.  \nDonnarumma, who was player of the tournament after Italy's 2021 Euros triumph, saved penalties from Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho in the final against England at Wembley. \nHis full record for penalties faced during matches and in shootouts is 24 saves from 103 penalties. \nDonnarumma missed Luis Enrique's pre-shootout team talk as he headed down the tunnel, choosing instead to retrieve some pre-prepared notes from the dressing room about Liverpool's spot-kicks.\n\"I had prepared something with my trainer, it was right to take something back to try to save some penalties,\" said Donnarumma. \n\"I see a lot of criticism from journalists without knowing what the goalkeeper's job is.\n\"In the first leg we conceded a shot and a goal, it seemed like it was my fault but I always think about smiling, giving my best and working for the team.\"\nAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma cuts an imposing figure.\nBut unlike many of his peers, he has a slightly different tactic for penalties.\nMany goalkeepers use the moments before a penalty is taken to attempt to 'get into the head' of the taker - slowing down the taking of the penalty, retrieving the ball for the taker or moving along their line. \nDonnarumma is different.\nLaidback and calm, the Italian barely moves until the player puts the ball on the spot. \nJust as they are readying their run-up, he expands his arms to make the goal look as small as possible. \n\"The idea behind that is to stand as slim as you can to start with,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told Football Daily.\n\"The ball goes on the spot, now you're putting doubt in their mind, you spread yourself, make yourself big and awkward, making the goal look smaller. \n\"You don't do that when they're walking forward. You do it when the ball is on the spot to put doubt in their mind in the last seconds.\" \nDonnarumma remained level-headed after both of his penalty saves, barely celebrating as he prepared for the next. \n\"I'm sat here watching Donnarumma and thinking, 'Wow, look at the size of him!'\" Warnock added.\n\"How imposing is he in that goal? If he dives the right way he stands a great chance of getting it. The guy's a monster.\" \nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "It is a world cut off from our own by thick blankets of floating ice, but some scientists are taking the plunge to learn how these frozen depths are changing.\nThere is a 70cm-thick (28in) layer of ice capping the surface of this lake, in a remote corner of Lapland, northern Finland. Gathered around a hole cut into the ice is a group of around 20 people, peering down into the inky depths with some trepidation. The seemingly lifeless water below the ice has a temperature only slightly above 0C (32F). Some of them are about to jump down there to venture under the ice.\u00a0\nSophie Kalkowski-Pope is one of the divers preparing to visit this strange, upside-down world where she will swim below a ceiling of smooth ice. The marine biology graduate from the University of Queensland, Australia, is part of an ice-diving training party that has gathered here. She is wearing a dry suit and anticipating the initial cold shock when that frigid water will hit the exposed skin on her face.\nIt's so numbing in these Arctic waters that, even with thermal clothing and special insulating gloves, divers find it hard to use their hands after just 30 minutes underwater. There are other dangers, too, so strict safety protocols are in place. Divers are tethered to the surface using a safety rope, with a handler on the surface communicating with the diver via rope signals. One tug for \"ok\", two tugs for \"stop\", three for \"come back\".\nA standby diver waits nearby in full gear, ready to enter the water if there's an emergency. And there are two holes cut in the ice next to each other so there are two exit points.\nThe lines of rope linking divers back to the surface could become entangled in submerged branches or logs, other debris, or even the diver's own equipment such as fins or tanks.\nThe training here on a frozen lake is practice for work that will be done out on the sea ice of the Arctic and Antarctic, where there are added dangers \u2013 large seals sometimes gather at the dive holes, preventing divers from leaving the water.\nWith one final check of her equipment, Kalkowski-Pope puts her breathing apparatus in her mouth \u2013 and flings herself in.\nToday, ice is still a key feature of the Arctic but it is becoming less and less common. Because of climate change, the Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world. Satellite data reveals the area of sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean has declined by around 13.2% per decade, on average, since monitoring began in 1979.\nScientists, driven to understand the changes unfolding here, are going to extremes to carry out their fieldwork. Some are learning ice diving techniques, so that they may observe underwater Arctic ecosystems and document the hastening retreat of the ice. Their short, and sometimes dangerous, expeditions are revealing the secrets of a rapidly thawing world.\u00a0\n\"Once you get in the water, you realise what a beautiful environment you're in and you calm down a bit,\" says Kalkowski-Pope as she describes the natural trepidation that people have ahead of an ice dive.\u00a0\nShe has come to Kilpisj\u00e4rvi in Lapland, over 248 miles (400km) north of the Arctic Circle, to join other divers from all over the world on an ice diving training course. The trainees plod gingerly around two rectangular entry holes that they've cut in the lake's ice.\u00a0\nIt may be the middle of March but it still feels very much like winter here. The lake is frozen over and surrounded by Finland's highest fells, still draped in thick snow.\nPerry Brandes, a commercial diver from Florida, where he is used to a far warmer climate, has just completed his first ice dive. \"It's very peaceful,\" he says. \"You look up and see light coming through. It's like looking at a city from afar.\" This, he explains, is the sun peeking through holes in the ice above. Those twinkling lights are like beacons that guide the divers back to the surface. (You can read more about what it is like under the ice in Antarctica in Katherine Latham's fascinating article about this upside down ice-scape.)\nKalkowski-Pope and Brandes are two of 12 participants on the week-long polar research diving course, which has been organised by the University of Helsinki.\nAll of those taking part are already seasoned divers who have honed their skills in temperate and tropical waters. This is the next level. Should they master ice diving here, it could enable them to join scientific diving expeditions in the Arctic or Antarctic.\u00a0\n\"There's probably only a few hundred people in the world who can do polar base diving work at the moment,\" says Edd Stockdale, coordinator of the Finnish Scientific Diving Academy, who leads the course. \"The polar areas are melting. We need scientists who are able to monitor what's happening,\" he explains.\nScientific research in the polar regions is critically important for climate change monitoring. The melting of polar ice contributes to rising sea levels around the world. By studying changes in sea ice, scientists are able to gain a better understanding of how quickly climate change is unfolding.\nIce diving, in particular, allows researchers to collect first-hand data on ice thickness, density and movement as well as water temperatures and salinity. The polar regions also have unique flora and fauna adapted to living in extremely cold conditions, and some of these organisms are visible during ice dives.\nIn 2017, Alf Norkko, a professor of marine research at the University of Helsinki, and his team discovered\u00a0big changes on the seafloor under Antarctic sea ice since their previous diving expedition in the same area in 2009.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There was a remarkable increase in the abundance of life,\" he says. Levels of chlorophyll and other plant compounds deposited in the sediment on the sea floor had risen dramatically, indicating that the amount of plankton and algae in the water had increased. \"In just a few years, the sea ice had got thinner, which allowed more light to get through so there was more food supply for starfish, worms, sponges and sea spiders on the seafloor.\"\nA recently published study of kelp forests off the coast of the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard saw divers make repeated trips to the same site over a 25 year period to examine how warming temperatures were affecting these important ecosystem by changing the mix of seaweed growing there.\nData collected by research divers from the British Antarctic Survey's Rothera Research Station also recently helped to show that the coastal seabed off the West Antarctic Peninsula is more frequently being struck by icebergs due to reductions in sea ice. These collisions cause catastrophic damage, killing almost everything in their path and scouring enormous scars along the seabed.\nNorkko adds that it is helpful for scientists from many different fields to take part in the ice dives. \"It's not enough for a marine biologist to go down and count the starfish on the sea floor,\" he says. \"We need multidisciplinary teams with a chemist and a physicist to go down and connect the dots.\" This enables researchers to more comprehensively describe the range of physical and biological processes that occur in these waters.\nHowever, such fieldwork is risky. \"It's dangerous. You can't make any mistakes,\" warns Finnish explorer Pata Degerman, who also teaches on the course. \"It's like diving in a cave in a sense that the ice is a roof above your head. You can't just go up anywhere you need to find an exit hole.\"\nPre-dive, the trainees don special clothing to protect themselves from the extreme cold: thermal underwear beneath a dry suit, gloves, and a neoprene hood that covers their head and neck. Even so, they can't stay in the water for long. Their hands lose dexterity quickly in the freezing conditions. Instructors say most divers can't use their hands properly after about 30 minutes beneath the ice.\nDivers on the training course descend into the water in pairs to a depth of 12m (39ft) while tethered to a safety line, which is standard procedure for ice diving. This safety line takes the form of a sturdy rope that physically connects divers to the surface. On the training course at Kilpisj\u00e4rvi, each line is tended by one of the trainees, who is tasked with managing slack and making sure the line doesn't get entangled.\n\"Your guideline is like a baby's umbilical cord. You can see you're connected and you feel safe,\" says Brandes.\u00a0\nThe safety line is also the only means of communication that divers have with their colleagues at the surface. Five minutes after entering the water, a diver will pull hard on the rope to signal that they are OK and that things are progressing as planned. The tender on the surface pulls their end of the cord to acknowledge the message. \"This gets repeated every five minutes during the dive,\" explains Degerman. \"It's very simple but it works.\"\nIf there's no reply, or the tenders feel that something is wrong, emergency procedures kick in. A diver is always waiting on standby at the surface, ready to attach themselves to the line and jump in to find out what's going on. Once they reach the silent diver, they might need to give them air or even push them upwards and back out of the hole, adds Degerman.\u00a0\nAmong the things that can go wrong are problems with regulators, the devices divers use to breathe while underwater. The moisture in a diver's breath can actually freeze and cause the regulator to malfunction, says Degerman.\nDuring the week-long course, there were a number of \"free flows\",\u00a0 situations in which the regulator delivered air continuously at full flow, rather than in a controlled manner synchronized with a diver's inhalations. These free flow events are more likely when diving in cold water as regulators can freeze more easily. When a diver inhales, the regulator reduces high-pressure air from the tank to ambient pressure. In freezing water, this can cause moisture in the regulator to form ice that can jam the valve open, leading to a continuous flow of air making it hard to breathe properly.\u00a0\nTo remedy the problem, divers can switch over to their backup system. If that doesn't work, they have to get the attention of their diving buddy so that they can begin sharing their air supply and return to the surface.\nIce divers don't wear a full face mask because that would make it difficult to remove during a free flow incident. But this means they experience a significant cold shock upon entering the water.\u00a0\n\"I'd never dived in cold water before,\" says Kalkowski-Pope. \"Going beneath the ice layer for the first time and feeling the cold water on my face was really unique.\"\nDespite the challenges of ice diving, Norkko says he's never had an accident on any of his polar expeditions. He puts that down to preparedness, training, and assessing and managing risks carefully.\n\"People worry about different things but I think the biggest risk is dry suit flooding, especially in Antarctica,\" he says. \"We have salt water there that freezes less easily: it's -2C (28F), which gives you a bad cold shock.\"\nSeals sometimes sit over dive holes, blocking a diver's exit from the water. \"You can't get past a 300kg (47st) seal,\" laughs Norkko. \"That's why we always have two holes.\"\nWhile there are clearly risks in doing this work, the chance to gather crucial data makes them worth taking, says Anni Makinen, who works as a scientific diver for an environmental consultancy in Finland: \"I'd like to help to get some scientific knowledge that will influence politicians.\"\nIce diving research projects still need willing humans like Makinen. While robots and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are increasingly important for scientific fieldwork, including in the Arctic, there are things that machines will never be able to do, stresses Rodd Budd from New Zealand's National Institute of Atmospheric Research and coordinator of Antarctica New Zealand's dive operations.\n\"An ROV can only see what's directly in front of it, so it may go past something interesting,\" he explains. In some cases wild animals such as seals or white whales have been used to collect data from under the ice by attaching sensors to them, but they can't be controlled to go where researchers might want. Human divers, on the other hand, naturally take in a wider field of view and can adjust their explorations depending on what they deem most important to investigate.\nPlus, humans are less intrusive, says Perry Brandes, the Floridian diver, who notes that ROVs create a lot of noise and shine powerful lights ahead of them. Human divers can be much less disruptive. \"Many of the animals actually look at us divers,\" adds Brandes. \"There's an interaction between us.\"\nNorkko says that he and his fellow scientists are so dedicated to this work because they are aware of the urgency of climate change. At present, there is a race afoot to understand it, and to respond to it.\n\"Climate change is progressing at such a rate that decisions are sometimes not made with the best available scientific knowledge. This is a problem. We need to keep science at the front,\" says Norkko.\nBut there is also the alluring thrill of fieldwork like this. Going to places where few humans can, in order to document our planet a little better. That, too, says Norkko, keeps researchers like him returning to the dark world under the ice. \"There is, of course, also an element of adventure that drives us.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Native Americans, English sailors and pirates all came together on Ocracoke Island in North Carolina to create the only American dialect that is not identified as American.\nI'd never been called a \"dingbatter\" until I went to Ocracoke, North Carolina for the first time. I've spent a good part of my life in the state, but I'm still learning how to speak the\u00a0Hoi Toider\u00a0brogue. The people here just have their own way of speaking: it's like someone took Elizabethan English, sprinkled in some Irish tones and 1700s Scottish accents, then mixed it all up with pirate slang. But the Hoi Toider dialect is more than a dialect. It's also a culture, one that's slowly fading away. With each generation, fewer people play meehonkey, cook the traditional foods or know what it is to be \"mommucked\".\nIn an effort to put his \"America first\" stamp on the nation's speech, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order making English the country's official language. It marks the first time in the US's nearly 250-year history that the nation has had an official language. Yet, on this small 9.6-square-mile island surrounded by the swirling waters of the Atlantic, residents still speak what is arguably the most English version of English in the country \u2013 and many Americans don't understand it.\nAs the island's official website proudly proclaims: \"With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets.\"\nLocated 20 miles from the North Carolina mainland, Ocracoke Island is fairly isolated. You can't drive there as there are no bridges, and most people can\u2019t fly either as there are no commercial flights. If you want to go there, it has to be by boat. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, that meant Ocracoke was a perfect spot for pirates to hide, as no soldiers were going to search 16 miles of remote beaches and forests for wanted men.\nWilliam Howard was one of those outlaws, serving as quartermaster on Blackbeard\u2019s ship Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge. Leaving before Blackbeard\u2019s final battle in 1718, Howard made his way to Virginia, eventually taking the general pardon offered by King George I to all pirates. But unlike some, Howard had a plan. For several decades, he dropped out of sight, only to reappear in 1759 when he bought Ocracoke Island for \u00a3105 from a man named Richard Sanderson, a justice and later a General Assembly member in mainland North Carolina.\nHoward settled down along with some other ex-pirates and started building a community with boat pilots who had been stationed on the island to help guide merchant ships around sandbars in the area. A mainland North Carolina Native American tribe also interacted with the early settlers. The Woccon tribe had set up fishing and hunting outposts on the island, which they called Woccocock. Through misspellings and mispronunciations, it became Wokokon, Oakacock and Okercock, before finally arriving at the current version of Ocracoke in the mid-1700s. So at this point, there were Native Americans, English sailors and pirates from a variety of places all in one location. And that isolated community of just under 200 started blending words and dialects, and eventually building its own way of speaking. \u00a0\n\"It's the only American dialect that is not identified as American,\" said Dr Walt Wolfram, a North Carolina State University professor who studied the Ocracoke dialect for more than 20 years and currently works as the director of NC State\u2019s Language and Life Project. \"That's fascinating to me. You can find pronunciation, grammar structures and vocabulary on Ocracoke that are not found anywhere else in North America.\"\nHoward's community lived in near-isolation for almost two centuries. Electricity didn't arrive at the island until 1938 and a ferry service didn't start until 1957, leaving the islanders cut off except for the occasional supply trip to the mainland. Even today, things are a bit different for the island's 676 residents than on mainland North Carolina.\n\"You have to be a certain type of individual to enjoy living here,\" said Chip Stevens, an island resident directly descended from Howard and the former owner of the local hotel Blackbeard's Lodge. \"There isn't a Lowes or a Harris Teeter or any [supermarkets]. Rarely does anyone go off the island without a cooler [to bring back supplies]. You have to be almost a holistic person, capable of dealing with less of a hectic nightlife lifestyle.\"\nYes, mobile phones and laptops still work here, and if you want to sit down and watch some Major League Baseball in a pub, there are plenty of options. But in many other ways, the island is a throwback to a time before internet and television. Instead of cinemas, there are outdoor theatre groups. Local teashops, spice markets and other family-owned stores take the place of chain supermarkets. Cars are allowed on the 16 mile-long island, but most people just park them and walk everywhere. The island's children all attend one school, while residents work as everything from fishermen to brewery owners to woodworkers.\n\"It's amazing how coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country,\" Stevens said, sitting on the hotel's front porch. \"You feel that separation. It's a really nice feeling, being able to give your kids some freedom. When I was a kid, we'd leave [home] after breakfast, eat lunch at somebody else's house, walk to the beach, take a rowboat out in the water, and our parents never had to worry about us. We've maintained a lot of that.\"\nAnd they've still \u2013 just \u2013 maintained their unique way of speaking.\nWhen older Ocracoke natives, or \"O'cockers\" as they call themselves, speak, the \"I\" sound is an \"oi\", so they say \"hoi\" instead of \"high\". That's where the Hoi Toider name comes from: it's based on how the O'cockers say \"high tide\".\nThen there are the phrases and vocabulary, many of which are also kept over from the original British and Irish settlers. For example, when you're on Ocracoke, someone might \"mommuck a buck before going up the beach\", which means \"to tease a friend before going off the island\".\n\"We have a lot of words that have been morphed to make our own,\" said Amy Howard, another of William Howard's descendants, who runs the Village Craftsmen, a local arts and crafts store. \"[Hoi Toider] is a combination from a whole blend of cultures. A lot of the early settlers were well travelled, so they ran into lots of different types of people. For example, the word \"pizer\" we use comes from [a European] word which means porch. So if you're going to be sitting on your pizer, you're sitting on your porch.\"\nThere's a long list of words in Ocracoke vocabulary that are taken from countries across the globe. \"Quamish\", for example, means sick or nauseated. It comes from the 16th-Century English word \"qualm\". Then there's \"buck\", which means a male friend. You can trace that back to 13th-Century Germany, where it originally meant a male deer, as it does in most English-speaking places today.\nLocals even made up words in some cases. For example, early settler children played a game of hide and seek called meehonkey. Everyone would hide and call out \"meehonkey\" while one person tried to find them. According to island tradition, Amy told me, the kids believed meehonkey was the sound a goose made as it flew by. Then there's \"dingbatter\", which is used for anyone who isn\u2019t a native.\nBut with each generation, the dialect is starting to disappear. The world is coming to the island through television and the internet, as well as with the long line of tourists who show up every summer. There's also more people from the mainland moving in.\n\"What's happening is that some of these small dialects that thrive on isolation are dying because isolation is a thing of the past,\" said Dr Wolfram. \"They still pick up terms and vocabulary, but when a kid from the island retains a strong dialect, that was the norm and now it\u2019s an exception.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Alabama musuem grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022\u00a0How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n\u2022\u00a0The only land disputed between the US and Canada\nIn the past, kids adopted the dialect because that was the only version they heard. Now there are hundreds of dialects and languages that most will encounter before they graduate high school. In fact, as of 2024, on this island of 676 people, fewer than half actually speak with the full Hoi Toider brogue.\n\"Within one to two generations, it'll be gone,\" said Dr Wolfram. \"It's dying out and we can\u2019t stop that.\"\nYet while the dialect may be in danger, the islanders are managing to hold onto their unique culture in other ways. In the beginning, settlers often had to come up with alternatives when they didn't have the right ingredients for a recipe. That same concept holds true today: with limited stores on the island, if you run out of supplies, you can either head to the mainland for what you need or just find a replacement.\n\"Ocracoke is really good at adapting,\" said Amy. \"I joke that we need to make a cookbook for Ocracoke that says what the recipe is and then what you can actually get, because almost inevitably, you get a quirky recipe and you won\u2019t have everything you need.\"\nThat's actually how the fig cake, which is now Ocracoke's signature dish, came to be. The story goes that in 1964, island resident Margaret Garrish was making a date cake and she had all the ingredients mixed in, except one.\n\"She found she didn't have any [dates], so she did what we all do and looked in her cupboard and found a jar of fig preserves,\" Amy said, explaining that figs are a holdover from the original settlers, and you can find fig trees in almost every yard. \"She threw them in the cake, mixed them up and now we have fig cakes.\"\nNow every year in August, the island holds a Fig Festival, complete with a fig cake bake-off, fig tastings, a square dance and traditional games like meehonkey.\nBut while some traditions stand strong, residents do see the island changing.\nNew York native Daphne Bennink\u00a0came to the island 35 years ago and never left. For her, the change, in some ways, reflects the same wealth of experience those original settlers brought.\n\"I see more and more people coming here,\" Bennink said. \"On Ocracoke, you have this kind of patchwork quilt of all people from all walks. It\u2019s a little bit of a melting pot.\"\nAs for what type of culture that melting pot will create? Everyone I talked to pretty much said the same thing: no matter what changes, some things will stay the same on Ocracoke. If someone is sick, the community will pitch in. If one business owner needs help, 14 others will show up to solve the problem. The dialect may change, but the intent behind those words will remain the same.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.\nNow two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture. \nHe has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.\nMeanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.\nSo is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\nA chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising. \nA JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs. \nThe forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.\nHe has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.\nThe latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however. \nPrices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.  \nStill, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success. \n\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty. \nThe posture has increased investor worries about his plans. \nGoldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\". \n\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned. \n\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like. \nInvestors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.\nBrian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool. \n\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.\nIn recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.\nRetail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.\nSome analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.\nThat could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation. \n\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.\n\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.\nBut the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says. \nThe unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump. \nInvestors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).\nChipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.\nThat type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy. \nNow, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.\nTech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.\n\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said. \nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

He doesn't have a name for it \u2013 yet.\n\"It's like a little teacher or a little friend,\" the boy said, as he showed his mum the next move he was considering on the chess board.\nMoments later, the robot chimed in: \"Congrats! You win.\" Round eyes blinking on the screen, it began rearranging the pieces to start a new game as it continued in Mandarin: \"I've seen your ability, I will do better next time.\"\nChina is embracing AI in its bid to become a tech superpower by 2030.\nDeepSeek, the breakthrough Chinese chatbot that caught the world's attention in January, was just the first hint of that ambition. \nMoney is pouring into AI businesses seeking more capital, fuelling domestic competition. There are more than 4,500 firms developing and selling AI, schools in the capital Beijing are introducing AI courses for primary and secondary students later this year, and universities have increased the number of places available for students studying AI. \n\"This is an inevitable trend.

We should not reject it.\"\nShe is keen for her son to learn both chess and the strategy board game Go \u2013 the robot does both, which persuaded her that its $800 price tag was a good investment. Its creators are already planning to add a language tutoring programme.\nPerhaps this was what the Chinese Communist Party hoped for when it declared in 2017 that AI would be \"the main driving force\" of the country's progress.

AI funding got yet another boost at the government's annual political gathering, which is currently under way. This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.\nBut DeepSeek has shown that Chinese companies can overcome these barriers. And that's what has stunned Silicon Valley and industry experts \u2013 they did not expect China to catch up so soon.\nIt's a reaction Tommy Tang has become accustomed to after six months of marketing his firm's chess-playing robot at various competitions.\nTimmy's machine comes from the same company, SenseRobot, which offers a wide range in abilities \u2013 Chinese state media hailed an advanced version in 2022 that beat chess Grand Masters at the game.\n\"Parents will ask about the price, then they will ask where I am from. They expect me to come from the US or Europe. They seem surprised that I am from China,\" Mr Tang said, smiling. \"There will always be one or two seconds of silence when I say I am from China.\"\nHis firm has sold more than 100,000 of the robots and now has a contract with a major US supermarket chain, Costco.\nOne of the secrets to China's engineering success is its young people. In 2020, more than 3.5 million of the country's students graduated with degrees in science, technology, engineering and maths, better known as STEM.\nThat's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. \"Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,\" Xi told party leaders last week.\nEver since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has \"been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,\" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. \"In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.\"\nBehind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.\nThe company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.\n\"Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,\" Mr Lyu insists.\nThe success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and \"is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,\" he added.\n\"It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.\"\nSix homegrown AI firms, including DeepSeek, have now been nicknamed China's six little dragons by the internet \u2013 the others are Unitree Robotics, Deep Robotics, BrainCo, Game Science, and Manycore Tech.\nSome of them were at a recent AI fair in Shanghai, where the biggest Chinese firms in the business showed off their advances, from search and rescue robots to a backflipping dog-like one, which wandered the halls among visitors.\nIn one bustling exhibition hall, two teams of humanoid robots battled it out in a game of football, complete in red and blue jerseys. The machines fell when they clashed \u2013 and one of them was even taken off the field in a stretcher by their human handler who was keen to keep the joke going.\nIt was hard to miss the air of excitement among developers in the wake of DeepSeek. \"Deepseek means the world knows we are here,\" said Yu Jingji, a 26-year-old engineer.\nBut as the world learns of China's AI potential, there are also concerns about what AI is allowing the Chinese government to learn about its users.\nAI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.\nThe West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.\nBut Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.\nThat same fear \u2013 where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea banned new downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia have barred the app from government-issued devices.\nChinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that \"privacy was a red line\" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.\n\"DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,\" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that \"the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain\".\nBut China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage \u2013 because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.\nSo the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.\nSo, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.\n\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"\nThis could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.\nXi has repeatedly declared \"technological self-reliance\" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.\nThe Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race \u2013 the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for \"AI triumphalism\" because China was still in \"catch-up mode\".\nPresident Xi is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, robots and advanced tech in preparation for a marathon that he hopes China will eventually win.",

        "article_text": "You would never say Arsenal and Manchester United are having similar seasons, but Sunday's Premier League stalemate at Old Trafford was a reminder that they have something in common - a problem to solve up front.\nWhile the Gunners' attacking flaw appears to be a glaring one, in that they have played much of this campaign without a recognised centre-forward, United do have some strikers, but their regular failure to find the net has left people questioning whether they are good enough to help Ruben Amorim's side climb the table.\nWayne Rooney had sympathy for Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund when he analysed their display for his former club on Match of the Day 2, but felt Arsenal's issue again proved costly after watching them lose even more ground to Liverpool in an increasingly one-sided title race.\n\"I always feel the teams with the best number nines have the best chance of winning things,\" United's all-time record goalscorer, who won five Premier League titles, told BBC Sport.\n\"Liverpool are probably an exception to that, with the way they rotate the player they use through the middle, rather than having a regular number nine that the team is built around.\n\"The number nine is still so important for them, though. Mohamed Salah, cutting in from wide areas, is their main goalscorer but, whether it is Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota or Darwin Nunez in the centre, they all chip in with a good amount of goals.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHojlund needs more confidence to start scoring  - Rooney\nLiverpool have scored 17 more league goals than Arsenal this season - a simple statistic but a telling one, even taking into account the leaders have played one game more.\nWith Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz out for the season and another key attacker, Bukayo Saka, absent, it has been left to midfielder Mikel Merino to fill in as an emergency striker for Mikel Arteta's side in the way he did against United, this time with little effect.\nWhile the Gunners controlled the game for long periods, goalscorer Declan Rice conceded afterwards that they did not have the cutting edge needed. Rooney felt a specialist finisher was what they were missing.\n\"A proper number nine - a forward who has played there his whole life - brings  something different to any team,\" he explained.\n\"I am talking about that natural goalscoring instinct, which a player who is trying to learn the position probably doesn't have.\n\"A midfielder playing forward like Merino can get hold of the ball and bring others into play, but what a goalscorer brings is that selfishness of wanting to be in the penalty area to finish chances.\n\"As we saw on Sunday, Rice was trying to help Arsenal to fill that position, as the player who was always making forward runs and arriving in the box. He did really well in that advanced role, but he cannot always be there.\"\nDeclan Rice made six touches inside the United box, along with Jurrien Timber the joint-most by an Arsenal player\nMerino may be a midfielder, but he has scored three Premier League goals this year. Hojlund and Zirkzee have none.\nThose numbers may not suggest the answer to United's goalscoring problems lies within their current squad, but Rooney argues that any striker would find it difficult playing up front for United at present.\n\"Before they scored at the end of the first half, United had managed one shot at goal and none on target,\" Rooney said.\n\"Their problem was their lack of movement in midfield, because they could not make the passes to get up the pitch. Instead, they were forced to play balls up to Zirkzee and it was very hard for him to do anything with them.\n\"The best centre-halves, like Arsenal's are, force you under the ball in that situation or nick balls off you.\n\"If the ball is getting chipped in to you around the halfway line, which is what Zirkzee was getting, and you haven't got the support in and around you, then it is very difficult and you have to work extremely hard.\n\"Firstly, you are fighting the centre-half and holding him off you. Then you've got to get the ball under control and try to bring someone into play.\n\"If the quality of the pass up to you is not great, especially when it is coming to you around your neck like some of United's passes were, it is even harder.\n\"A lot of the time Zirkzee was getting given a 50-50 ball, the kind where you have to work wonders to win it. Ideally, what you want is your team to make a few passes and play out of the pressure, then as the striker you are getting the ball to feet, which makes it a lot easier, and you are closer to the opposition goal too.\n\"For a centre-half, if you are facing your own goal and in your own half, then it makes their job a lot easier, but if you are higher up the pitch the striker has lots more options. The defender cannot be all over you because they are afraid of giving free-kicks away.\n\"What United needed to do was get some control of the game, and get on the ball. Then the striker can make the little five yard bursts to get behind the defence, which give you a better chance of scoring.\"\nWhile Zirkzee had few sights of goal in the first half, replacement Hojlund got a couple of good opportunities to end his drought when the game opened up late on - but was unable to take them.\n\"There was one chance where his shot was blocked after he had shown fantastic movement to get to the near post,\" Rooney said.\n\"He goes once, he checks back, goes again, got across Gabriel and got a good contact on his shot, so he had done everything right. It is only a great block that stops the goal.\"\nHojlund's run to the near post - his first-time shot was blocked and flew wide\n\"The one that will be highlighted, though, is the one where Rice gets back and tackles him after the ball breaks for him in the area, and that was purely down to a lack of confidence.\n\"You see Hojlund take a touch and then he is looking up to see where he wants to put his shot when he doesn't have the time for that.\n\"That's the kind of scenario where, as a striker, if you are scoring goals you don't even have to look up - you know where the goal is.\n\"To me that really showed how much he needs a goal right now, but all he can do is keep working.\n\"I've got faith in him. He's a good player who works hard, which is really important. He needs that bit of luck as well, but once he gets a break then more goals will follow.\n\"As a striker for Manchester United, when you are not scoring goals there is a lot of pressure and a lot of people questioning if you can do it for United.\n\"The best thing for Hojlund to do is simplify it. Making runs into the penalty box is as easy at it comes. There was an attack late on against Arsenal I highlighted on Match of the Day 2 where Alejandro Garnacho is about to put in a cross and Hojlund needs to have that desire to get in the box.\n\"He goes to go, then for some reason he stops. If he carries on his run then he is in the right place around about the six yard box to get a tap-in for the winner when Bruno Fernandes' shot is saved.\n\"When you are short of confidence you have got to make sure you make it into the penalty area and put yourself in a position where you can score, so that is something he can improve on.\nThe arrow shows the run Rooney thinks Hojlund should have made\n\"We are still waiting to see Hojlund find his feet for United, but it's important to point out that the whole team have not been at their best.\n\"I feel for him from that point of view because, nine times out of 10, forwards rely on their team-mates for service.\n\"United have not been playing well or creating enough chances, so he has not been in a team dominating possession, sliding balls in behind the defence or putting balls into the box.\"\nOne way for both clubs to solve their attacking issues will be in the summer transfer window, but it is not just United and Arsenal who seemingly need a new striker.\nChelsea are also being linked with a string of number nines, and even Liverpool are supposedly lining up a goalscorer as a potential replacement for Salah, whose contract is up at the end of the season.\nIpswich's Liam Delap is reportedly being targeted by several clubs. The 22-year-old is a player Rooney considered signing in the past, when he was a teenager available on loan from Manchester City in 2021.\n\"Liam is someone I looked at for the clubs I've been at, and he is a fantastic player,\" Rooney said. \"He is a powerful lad and has a great physique to play the role he does.\n\"He probably surprised a few people by going to Ipswich, but he has scored some great goals.\n\"Ipswich are struggling in the league, so it is not always that easy for him, and I have seen a few games where he can get frustrated because he is not getting the service - exactly the problem I was talking about with United.\n\"But Liam has a massive amount of potential and I am sure he is going to have a fantastic career.\n\"I can see why the top clubs are being linked with him, but they are all going for the same players, because there is a shortage of number nines.\"\nLiam Delap has scored 10 Premier League goals this season\nIt does seem like the same strikers are on the summer shortlist of several clubs.\nArsenal failed with a January bid for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, while Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta has been talked about as a target for the Gunners and United.\n\"Mateta is a big, strong lad who scores a lot of goals,\" Rooney said. \"From watching Arsenal over the past few games in the Premier League, they have put a lot of balls into the box without having anyone to get on the end of them. I am sure he would help from that point of view.\"\nAs well as finding someone who suits your playing style, availability is another obstacle.\nNewcastle's Alexander Isak is often viewed as the answer to Arsenal's lack of strikers, and he has also been touted as a potential Salah replacement.\n\"Isak would fit into any team,\" Rooney said. \"He has been fantastic over the past couple of years and scored a lot of goals. His link-up play and movement is brilliant too.\n\"You look at any team in the Premier League, and whether it is United and Arsenal or Liverpool then he would improve them, but I also think it will be very difficult to get him out of Newcastle. Why would they sell him?\"",

        "article_text": "Actor Gene Hackman was alone. \nThe two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals. \nMedical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living. \nIf he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died. \nOfficials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes. \nThe pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window. \nAuthorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.\nTheir remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate. \nBut a police investigation found no foul play. \nInstead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions. \n\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.\nShe noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act. \n\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described. \nThen later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said. \nThough no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.\nAt a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor. \nGiven Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.\nHis autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.\nMs Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe. \n\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.\nDr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.\n\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"\nDr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.\nHe said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.\nThe couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years. \n\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.\nHis partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said. \n\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"\nLaura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers. \n\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained. \nMs Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself. \nJeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.  \n\"It breaks my heart he was alone so long.\" \nA list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.",

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has been in a tricky spot ever since.\nPlay the tournament without India? Indian markets make up a significant portion of the ICC's income, reported to be as much as 80%, external.\nTake away the opportunity for Pakistan to host a first tournament for 29 years at the last minute? Not feasible either.\nThe result was India playing the tournament in one city, remaining in one hotel, as the row over the advantages they held rumbled on throughout.\nNew Zealand covered more than 7,000km travelling to matches, while the nearest an India player got to a plane was Kuldeep Yadav's wide-armed celebration after claiming the crucial wicket of Rachin Ravindra in the final.\nAt every turn, India denied the obvious, until Mohammed Shami said the situation had \"definitely\" helped them after their semi-final. Moments earlier, in the same room, coach Gautam Gambhir suggested anyone that said so needed to \"grow up\".\nOpposition players remained largely quiet, until South Africa's David Miller said he would be supporting New Zealand in the final.\nSpeak to players in private and the power India seemingly hold is simply met with a shrug. This is the path cricket is on.\nIn 2023, there was the controversy of the semi-final pitch switched at the last minute in a move that appeared to suit India's spinners.\nEight months ago, India beat England in the T20 semi-final in Guyana, when again Rohit Sharma was the only captain to know where his side's matches would be played before departure.\nThat fixture was played at 10:30am to suit Indian TV, limiting the local crowd. This time India's last group match was played on a Sunday - when TV viewership in India is highest - and caused the farcical situation of South Africa having to fly to Dubai but return to Pakistan less than 24 hours later.\nHome advantage for a tournament you are hosting is one thing.

The fact they have not had injured star fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah for the Champions Trophy has largely been forgotten.\nBut these ICC men's events - increased in number to include either a Champions Trophy, T20 or 50-over World Cup every year until 2031 - are supposed to be the internationals game's counter to the money-spinning Indian Premier League. \nInstead, they now come so often, follow such a familiar pattern, that indifference is perhaps beginning to set in.\nThere were no written journalists from India's fellow semi-finalists, Australia, South Africa or New Zealand, at the Champions Trophy - hardly the sign of a healthy sport.\nThe fallout from England's dismal exit was loud among the diehards but outside of that? \nYou be the judge about whether this tournament came up in the family WhatsApp group.\nTheir chaotic organisation does not help either, with the schedule for this competition confirmed just 57 days before it began. \nNo English media were able to witness that Guyana semi-final because of the quick turnaround, a lack of flights and the fact it took place in a country US authorities advise against visiting on safety grounds.\nIn cricket, these things are simply waved through.\nThings will not get easier in the next two tournaments - the women's World Cup later this year and the men's T20 version in the spring of 2026.\nBoth will be held in India, in partnership with Sri Lanka in the case of the T20, meaning should Pakistan qualify they will get the treatment their rivals had here.\nPakistan could find themselves with the same advantages India had but uncertainties - two venues needed to be lined up for a final - are not going anywhere.\nIt is not that hope is lost. \nThis tournament has shown, yet again, that the product of international white-ball cricket on the field remains strong, despite two washouts and too many one-sided games.\nAustralia batter Josh Inglis' century against England was an all-timer, Ravindra continued to emerge as one of the next stars of the sport and Afghanistan all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai should be the want of every Hundred team in Wednesday's draft.\nA dearth in quality is not a threat to international cricket's future.

        "article_text": "The NHS is \"looking into\" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company. \nThe flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.\nThe software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years. \nMedefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.\nThe flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.\nIn late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"\nMedefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.\nHowever, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.\nThe software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.\n\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"\nThe problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other. \nThe engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.\nHe said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure. \n\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.\nOn discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.\nMedefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.\nIt says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\". \nMedefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.\nThe engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.\nIn a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"\nHe confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.\n\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"\nThe security agency will complete its review later this week. \nDr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"\n\nCybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern. \n\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.\n\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added. \nAnother expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.\n\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.\nMedefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England. \nIn a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.\n\"Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.\"",

        "article_text": "US officials are headed to Russia to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, according to President Donald Trump. \nThe news comes after Ukrainian officials agreed to a 30-day ceasefire following a highly anticipated meeting with American officials in Saudi Arabia. \nEarlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the \"ball is truly in their [Russia's] court\" and that the US believes the only way to end the fighting was through peace negotiations. \nThe American visit comes as the Kremlin claimed President Vladimir Putin had visited Russia's Kursk region - parts of which have been under Ukraine's control since an incursion last year. \nFollowing the meeting in Jeddah on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was now up to the US to convince Russia to agree to the \"positive\" proposal.\nThe Kremlin has said it was studying the ceasefire deal, and that a phone call between Trump and Putin is possible. \nSpeaking alongside Ireland's Taoiseach - or Prime Minister - Miche\u00e1l Martin in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said he had received  \"positive messages\" about the possibility of a ceasefire. \n\"But a positive message means nothing,\" he said. \"This is a very serious situation.\" \nTrump did not specify which officials were travelling to Moscow.\nHowever, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House that National Security Secretary Mike Waltz had spoken to his Russian counterpart. \nEarlier this week, a source familiar with the matter told the BBC that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would head to Moscow for negotiations following the talks in Jeddah. \nThe White House confirmed the plans on Wednesday. \n\"We urge the Russians to sign on to this plan. This is the closest we have been to peace in this war,\" Leavitt said. \nThe Kremlin has said it is studying the proposed ceasefire and further details, which spokesman Dmitry Peskov said will come \"via various channels\" over the course of the next several days. \nIn the Oval Office, Trump said that he believes a ceasefire would make sense for Russia, adding - without further details - that there is a \"lot of downside to Russia\" as well.\n\"We have a very complex situation solved on one side. Pretty much solved. We've also discussed land and other things that go with it,\" Trump added. \"We know the areas of land we're talking about, whether it's pull back or not pull back.\" \nTo pressure Russia, Trump said that he \"can do things financially\". \n\"That would be very bad for Russia,\" he said. \"I don't want to do that because I want to get peace.\" \nThe meeting in Jeddah was the first between US and Ukrainian officials since a 28 February meeting between Zelensky, Trump and Vice-President JD Vance descended into a shouting match and, ultimately, a pause in US military assistance and intelligence sharing. \nThe pause was lifted following the meeting in Jeddah, and Trump said that he believes that the \"difficult\" Ukrainian side and Zelensky now want peace. \nEven as negotiations over a potential ceasefire are ongoing, fighting has raged in Ukraine. \nRussian drones and missiles reportedly struck targets in Kryvyy Rih - Zelensky's hometown - overnight, as well as in the port city of Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv. \nClashes also continued in Russia's Kursk region, where Peskov said Russian troops were \"successfully advancing\" and recapturing areas held by Ukrainian forces.\nAnd later on Wednesday, the Kremlin said Putin had visited a command post in the region. He was shown in footage released by the Kremlin walking alongside his military chief Valery Gerasimov, with both men wearing combat gear.\nIt marked the Russian president's first visit to the region since Ukraine's incursion across the border in August last year.\nRussian media report that Putin ordered the military to \"fully liberate\" the region during the visit. He is yet to comment on the ceasefire proposal agreed by Ukraine and the US on Tuesday.\nThe head of Ukraine's military, Oleksandr Syrsky, also indicated on Wednesday that some of its troops were withdrawing from Kursk. In a post on Telegram, he said: \"In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.\"",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump.\nThe former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. \nIn much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"  \nCarney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nCarney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. \nThe Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. \nCarney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.\nLoud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital.  \nThe party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. \nCarney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\nThe governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country\nAt the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.\nThey have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.\nMuch of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. \nThe US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy.\nCarney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was \"attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses\". \n\"We can't let him succeed,\" he added, as the crowd booed loudly.\nHe said his government would keep tariffs on US imports \"until the Americans show us respect\".\nCanada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed.\n\"I know these are dark days,\" Carney said. \"Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. \n\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\nCarney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.\nThe US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.\n\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney. \n\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"\nShortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.\nHe warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.\nThe Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".\nThey accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.\nPoilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. \nCarney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December.\nFederal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he \"embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues\". \n\"I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election.\" \nThe Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. \nThe former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left.\nA major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years.\nHe has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US.\nDuring the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",

This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.\nThe government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth. \nThe UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.\nIvy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.\nThe firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.\n\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"\nDr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet. \nIt doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.\nIn this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.\n\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me. \n\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"\nThe FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods. \nProf May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.\n\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"\nBut Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.\n\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.\n\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush.\"\nFollowing the backlash, Ms Jones, who has more than 92,000 followers on Instagram, made her account private. But several media outlets had already shared the video - as well as earlier posts, said to be taken in Australia, which show her holding an echidna and a \"little shark\". \nWombats, which are native to Australia, are a legally protected species across the country. Baby wombats share a strong bond with their mothers, and any separation can be distressing and harmful, conservationists say. \n\"Wombats are not a photo prop or plaything,\" said Suzanne Milthorpe, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection Australia, in a statement online. \n\"It's just unacceptable, and we're glad she's being called to account. Snatching a screaming baby wombat from their mother is not just appalling, it's very possibly illegal under state or national laws,\" Ms Milthrope said. \nSome experts believe Ms Jones's broke the law because Australia prohibits people from harming or taking native wildlife. \nIt is only allowed if the joey is in need of help because its mother has died, wildlife veterinarian Tania Bishop told ABC News.\nSome Australians are calling for Ms Jones to be deported. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told Sky News Australia her visa is being reviewed. \n\"Given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I'll be surprised if she even bothers,\" he said.\nAn online petition supporting her deportation has received 10,500 signatures so far.",

He was also accused of selling broadcasting and internet rights without authorisation.\nIn 2013, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) banned Mr Modi from any involvement in cricket activities for life.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want.\"\nAs scams become more sophisticated, research suggests that more people are concerned about the information they share online.\nIn a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN.\nThere are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles.\n\"First of all, people underappreciate privacy,\" says Vytautas Kaziukonis, chief executive at Surfshark, a security software company that encrypts user's online data and aims to make browsing secure.\n\"What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment.\"\nAnother issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis.\n\"Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,\" he says.\nAI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a \"deadly combination\", says Mr Kaziukonis. \nAlso, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.\nMr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.\nSo what can we do to minimise our footprints?\nFirstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.\n\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.\n\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"\nIt's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted. \n\"They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.\nGus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.\nHe suggests using a VPN (virtual private network) which, for a price, offers a user more privacy when online. \nHe also recommends cookie-blockers and selecting web browsers with privacy controls.\n\"The underlying solution remains that we must keep the pressure on our governments to have strong laws to protect everyone,\" Mr Hosein says.\nKaren Renaud is a computing scientist at the University of Strathclyde  working on security and privacy.\nLast year she studied 15 privacy policy documents, which lay out what a company is going to do with your data.\nShe found that the most complicated of them would take 32 minutes to read and would require college-level education to understand.\n\"The situation is pretty dire,\" she says.\nShe advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.\n\"Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.\"\nSome people turn to services such as DeleteMe and Surfshark, which help remove personal information from data brokers.\nAmanda Unterreiner, product manager at US-based data removal service DeleteMe, says high-profile individuals like video gamers and judges use their service as a safety measure.\n\"In the case of judges\u2026 because if they're announcing some decision, someone might show up at their house.\"\nShe also mentions the case of the killing earlier last year of United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson.\n\"Stories like that kind of spark regular people to think I better get protected.\"\nMs Unterreiner went through the process of having her data removed when she joined the company.\n\"You could see every other place I had ever lived, every phone number I've ever had, every email address, on the first page of Google. If someone wanted to steal my identity\u2026 they would be able to cause some real personal damage.\"\nThe company also offers a service to mask your house on Google Maps.\n\"You can look at street view, but that particular property will just be kind of very pixelated.\"\nThere's multiple reasons why Saam Collingwood, who lives near Stratford-upon-Avon, has cut back her online profile over the years. \nThe first was following an incident at work where she had included her personal Facebook account on an email to a client and her employer was unhappy.\n\"They were able to see photos from a night out,\" she says. \"That didn't go down too well.\"\nIn another incident she was trolled by a stranger online after posting a video of herself learning a dance routine on YouTube.\nPlus, rising online fraud convinced her to further reduce her online profile.\nShe hasn't completely erased her online presence but she no longer posts regularly on Facebook, reducing it about twice a year. \n\"I don't like it when people tag me, people knowing I'm not at home. Most times I remove the tag.\"\nShe says she has upgraded her anti-virus and security software with a service from online security firm Norton. \n\"I wanted to make sure websites weren't taking my details. It makes me more comfortable.\"\nBut are there any downsides to not being so present online?\n\"I miss seeing old friends [on Facebook] and people I would contact once or twice year,\" says Ms Smith.\nMr Kaziukonis says it's common to hear people say they don't care about privacy but he believes this is a flawed argument.\n\"They say I have nothing to hide.

Five favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.\nThe current prime minister, Mute B Egede, has made clear that Greenland is not for sale and deserves to be \"treated with respect\".\nHis party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) is projected to come out top with 31% of the vote, followed by the social democrat Simiut.\nThere are 72 polling stations scattered around Greenland's coast and voting continues until 20:00 (22:00 GMT), with results expected early on Wednesday.\nThe sheer size of Greenland and the remoteness of many of its settlements and small towns means delivering ballots on time can be a challenge. \nNo two towns are connected by road or rail, and the island is exposed to extreme Arctic weather.\nBack in 2018, the 55 residents of Savissivik in northern Greenland never received their ballots due to inclement weather, according to Danish reports. So an Air Greenland base manager on his 4x4 and a local hunter on dog sled joined forces to deliver the ballots on time.\nPlanes, helicopters, ships, speedboats, cars, snowmobiles and dog sleds are routinely employed to ensure ballots reach all corners of the country before the election.\nWhen the polls close, stations send their results in by email to Greenland's five municipalities to be added to the tally.\nAt the last parliamentary election in Greenland in 2021, the voter turnout was 65.9%.\nThe state of the healthcare system, social issues, fisheries and the economy have all been discussed over the course of the electoral campaign.\nBut it is the question of Greenland's independence from Denmark which has dominated the debate.\nAlthough it now semi-autonomous, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years.\nNaleraq - currently the largest opposition party - has gained momentum and promises to hold a snap vote on independence within three to four years.\nOther parties are more careful and have avoided giving exact timelines.\nSevering ties with Denmark would be a big blow to Greenland's economy, which depends on the fisheries sector. Danish subsidies currently contribute more than $565m (\u00a3435m) a year - a fifth of its total economic output or GDP.\n\"At the moment, [Greenland] is not ready for independence,\" the director of the Bank of Greenland Martin Kviesgaard told Danish media on the eve of the election. \"It will take many years to become completely ready for it, if you are talking about becoming financially self-sufficient... Fishing is not enough.\"\nPast colonial wrongdoings have meant that Denmark has largely kept out of the independence debate. \nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly said it is for Greenlanders to decide their future.\nThe US president first floated the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, towards the end of his first term in office.\nHowever, since the start of this year, he has expressed interest in acquiring the Arctic island with increasing frequency, to the alarm of many in Greenland as well as Denmark.\nIn January, Trump's son Donald Jr. visited Greenland on what he said was a \"personal day-trip\" but which sparked real nervousness that the Trumps' interest was not just fleeting.\nGreenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. \nIt also has a large American space facility and reserves of valuable minerals which have so far proved hard to exploit. \nLast week, Trump told the US Congress \"we're going to get [Greenland] - one way or the other\".\nThe president's shadow has therefore loomed large over this election. \nAt the final candidates' debate on Sunday night, five out of six party leaders said they did not believe the US president could be trusted.\nIf Greenland does eventually choose independence from Denmark, it would then have the freedom to pursue closer ties and become far more exposed to US interest.\nSo it is unsurprising that in January Donald Trump reposted a 2019 poll that indicated 68% of Greenlanders supported independence from Denmark.\nTrump's comments on Greenland caused barely concealed panic in Copenhagen earlier this year. \nMette Frederiksen spent much of January holding crisis talks with her government as well as other Scandinavian and European leaders. She also spoke to Trump on the phone on more than one occasion.\nThe frantic diplomacy has cooled in recent weeks as Ukraine and other global issues took centre stage in Washington.\nBut as Greenlanders voted on Tuesday, Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen made an oblique reference to President Trump, saying that \"major powers have a different interest in Greenland than they have had before\".\nOf course it was important, he added diplomatically, \"that Greenland elects some steadfast politicians to lead the country through it\".",

        "article_text": "If a passenger dies on board a flight, cabin crew members like Jay Robert have to think fast.\n\"We go from service to lifesaving to mortician, dealing with dead bodies and then doing crowd control,\" the 40-year-old says. \"We're having to calculate: 'Okay, we still need to serve 300 people breakfast or dinner and we have to deal with this'.\"\nJay, a cabin manager for a major European airline and a former crew member for Emirates, has more than a decade's experience working on planes. Like all cabin crew, he has been trained to deal with passenger deaths, but has only experienced one himself.\nHe says deaths on planes are \"very uncommon\" and that people are more likely to die on longer flights because of the physical toll of being immobile for a long period. Some flight crew don't experience an on-board fatality during their entire career, he says.\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013 concluded that dying on a flight was \"rare\". The study, which looked at emergency calls from five airlines to a medical communications centre between January 2008 and October 2010, found that 0.3% of patients who had an in-flight medical emergency died.\nLast month, an Australian couple spoke about their \"traumatic\" experience of sitting next to a body on a plane from Melbourne to Doha after a woman died during the flight.\nMitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin said cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him. Qatar Airways said it followed appropriate guidelines and apologised for \"any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused\".\nBBC News has spoken to cabin crew and other aviation experts about how mid-air deaths are usually handled, what the rules are around storing corpses on planes and what it's like to work on a flight when someone has died.\nFlight crew themselves can't certify a death - this has to be done by medical personnel. Sometimes, this happens on the plane if there's someone qualified on board but more often, it is done upon landing. Most airlines follow the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) guidelines on what to do if a passenger has been presumed dead, though policies vary slightly by airline.\nIn a medical emergency, cabin crew would administer first aid and seek help from any passengers who were medical professionals, while the captain would use a telecommunications system to get instructions from emergency doctors on the ground, says Marco Chan, a former commercial pilot and a senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University. If necessary, the captain would divert the flight as soon as possible.\nBut it's not always possible to save a passenger.\nIf a passenger is presumed dead, the person's eyes should be closed and they should be placed in a body bag, if available, or otherwise, covered with a blanket up to the neck, according to the IATA guidelines.\nPlanes have very limited space, and it's a challenge to find a suitable spot to place the body without disturbing other passengers and compromising the plane's safety. Per the IATA, the body should be moved to a seat away from other passengers or to another area of the plane, if possible. But if the plane is full, they would usually be returned to their own seat.\nIn a narrow-body plane - those typically used for short-haul flights across the UK or within Europe - there isn't enough room on board \"to really shield a passenger from what has happened\", says Ivan Stevenson, associate professor in aviation management at Coventry University.\nSpace on these planes is \"very, very confined\", he says. \"If someone dies on board an aircraft like that, it's quite likely they will need to be placed in a seat.\"\nProf Stevenson acknowledges it's \"very unfortunate, very unpleasant\" but that crew have to put the plane's safety first.\nCrew will \"try to give some decency to the dead body\" by placing it on an empty aisle and using curtains, blankets and dim lights, Jay says, but they might not have much choice.\nThe body can't be placed in the galley in case it blocks an emergency exit. It also can't be left in the aisles in case there is an emergency evacuation, Jay says, or placed in the crew rest area on a long-haul flight. \nIt's also hard to physically manoeuvre a body in such a confined space, Jay says. This is what happened in the Qatar Airways case, when Mr Ring said the deceased passenger couldn't be carried down the aisle.\nA plane would divert to save a passenger's life in the event of a medical emergency - but it usually wouldn't if they were already presumed dead, aviation experts and cabin crew say. There's \"no point diverting\", Mr Chan says.\nThe captain would inform both the airline's operations centre and air traffic control of the passenger's death as soon as possible, and the plane would be met by local authorities, Prof Stevenson says. Either local authorities or a representative from the airline would contact the passenger's family if they were flying alone.\nAlly Murphy, who hosts the Red Eye Podcast where she interviews flight attendants, experienced one passenger death during a flight in her 14 years working as cabin crew.\nA male passenger who had been travelling alone from Accra, Ghana, to London passed out in his seat. After being alerted by the passenger in the seat next to him, the crew realised he wasn't breathing normally and didn't have a pulse.\nThe crew moved the man to the galley to perform CPR. \"You're kind of trapped in a tin can that's not designed for roaming around,\" Ally recalls. But there was more space than usual in the galley because the carts were out for meal service.\nAlly and another crew member performed CPR for 40 minutes without success. The captain then decided to divert the plane to Lyon, France, and though Ally and her colleague knew they should have strapped themselves in for landing, they continued performing CPR the whole time, she says.\n\"We didn't want to leave him.\"\nAfter landing, paramedics took the passenger away. He was declared dead, having suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm, Ally recalls.\n\"I held him in my arms for the final moments of his life,\" she says. \"He probably would have chosen someone else for that, but he got me.\"\nAfter the plane set off again following the diversion, the passengers were \"quite quiet and sombre,\" she says. But on arrival at their destination airport, one passenger from the flight started shouting at her because he missed his connecting flight. \n\"That's the one and only time that I've ever told a passenger where to go,\" she says.\nWitnessing a passenger dying was a traumatic experience for Ally.\n\"I went home and sat in the bath and I cried. I could taste the man's breath for about a week afterwards,\" she says. \"It was a little traumatising for a while. I couldn't watch anything with CPR for a long time.\"\nCabin crew are offered support after a passenger dies, including therapy and the option to have their rosters cleared for a few days so they can process what has happened, Jay says. \nAlly and her colleagues had a debrief with her airline after the passenger died where they were given \"reassurances that we did everything that we could\". Afterwards, she was able to schedule her shifts with a friend for a month because she felt \"a bit shell-shocked\".\nBecause cabin crew aren't used to passenger fatalities, it can be an especially harrowing experience when a passenger does die on board, Jay says.\n\"We are not doctors, we are not nurses,\" Jay says. \"While we are trained to deal with it, we don't face it every day, so we're not really immune to it.\"",

But with the early onset of summer this year, the company is staring at a washout season and having to shift gears.  \n\"We've had to start making t-shirts instead of sweaters as the winter is getting shorter with each passing year. Our sales have halved in the last five years and are down a further 10% during this season,\" Goel told the BBC. \"The only recent exception to this was Covid, when temperatures dropped significantly.\"\nAcross India as cool weather beats a hasty retreat, anxieties are building up at farms and factories, with cropping patterns and business plans getting upended.\nData from the Indian Meteorological Department shows that last month was India's hottest February in 125 years. The weekly average minimum temperature was also above normal by 1-3C in many parts of the country.\nAbove-normal maximum temperatures and heatwaves are likely to persist over most parts of the country between March and May, the weather agency has warned.\nFor small business owners like Goel, such erratic weather has meant much more than just slowing sales. His whole business model, practised and perfected over decades, has had to change.\nGoel's company supplies clothes to multi-brand outlets across India. And they are no longer paying him on delivery, he says, instead adopting a \"sale or return\" model where consignments not sold are returned to the company, entirely transferring the risk to the manufacturer.\nHe has also had to offer bigger discounts and incentives to his clients this year.\n\"Big retailers haven't picked up goods despite confirmed orders,\" says Goel, adding that some small businesses in his town have had to shut shop as a result.\nNearly 1,200 miles away in Devgad town on India's western coast, the heat has wreaked havoc on India's much-loved Alphonso mango orchards.\n\"Production this year would be only around 30% of the normal yield,\" said Vidyadhar Joshi, a farmer who owns 1,500 trees.\nThe sweet, fleshy and richly aromatic Alphonso is a prized export from the region, but yields across the districts of Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, where the variety is predominantly grown, are lower, according to Joshi.\n\"We might make losses this year,\" Joshi adds, because he has had to spend more than usual on irrigation and fertilisers in a bid to salvage the crop.\nAccording to him, many other farmers in the area were even sending labourers, who come from Nepal to work in the orchards, back home because there wasn't enough to do.\nScorching heat is also threatening winter staples such as wheat, chickpea and rapeseed.\nWhile the country's agriculture minister has dismissed concerns about poor yields and predicted that India will have a bumper wheat harvest this year, independent experts are less hopeful.\nHeatwaves in 2022 lowered yields by 15-25% and \"similar trends could follow this year\", says Abhishek Jain of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (Ceew) think tank.\nIndia - the world's second largest wheat producer - will have to rely on expensive imports in the event of such disruptions. And its protracted ban on exports, announced in 2022, may continue for even longer.\nEconomists are also worried about the impact of rising temperatures on availability of water for agriculture.\nReservoir levels in northern India have already dropped to 28% of capacity, down from 37% last year, according to Ceew. This could affect fruit and vegetable yields and the dairy sector, which has already experienced a decline in milk production of up to 15% in some parts of the country.\n\"These things have the potential to push inflation up and reverse the 4% target that the central bank has been talking about,\" says Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist with Bank of Baroda.\nFood prices in India have recently begun to soften after remaining high for several months, leading to rate cuts after a prolonged pause.\nGDP in Asia's third largest economy has also been supported by accelerating rural consumption recently after hitting a seven-quarter low last year. Any setback to this farm-led recovery could affect overall growth, at a time when urban households have been cutting back and private investment hasn't picked up.\nThink tanks like Ceew say a range of urgent measures to mitigate the impact of recurrent heatwaves needs to be thought through, including better weather forecasting infrastructure, agriculture insurance and evolving cropping calendars with climate models to reduce risks and improve yields.\nAs a primarily agrarian country, India is particularly vulnerable to climate change.\nCeew estimates three out of every four Indian districts are \"extreme event hotspots\" and 40% exhibit what is called \"a swapping trend\" - which means traditionally flood-prone areas are witnessing more frequent and intense droughts and vice-versa.\nThe country is expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress by 2030, according to one estimate. Climate Transparency, the advocacy group, had pegged India's potential income loss across services, manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors from labour capacity reduction due to extreme heat at $159bn in 2021- or 5.4% of its GDP.\nWithout urgent action, India risks a future where heatwaves threaten both lives and economic stability.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

It's very hard to discover what it is you might like and you might miss out on some hidden gems.\" \nA lot has been written about layoffs and studio closures in the video games industry, but Brian points out that many websites and magazines dedicated to it have also closed. \n\"So you have this rising tide of new games coming out and then a drop in the number of people covering video games,\" he says.\nBrian thinks Ludocene has got people interested partly because it fills that space for people looking for more detailed, informed recommendations.\n\"Having an approach that helps you discover things that give you a better sense of whether you're going to like it allows you to invest your money, and for me, more importantly, your time in the things that you really enjoy,\" he says.\nLudocene seems to have struck a chord with the gaming community.\nIt's currently a prototype, but breezed past its \u00a326,000 Kickstarter target four days ahead of its deadline and plans to fully launch as a web app in August.\nIndependent developer Jodie Azhar, founder of studio Teazelcat Games, says she thinks the project looks \"really exciting\" overall.\n\"Hopefully, they're finding the things that existing algorithms are missing - really high quality games that didn't quite get the marketing at launch or the media coverage,\" she says.\nBut she does have some hesitation about the dating app mechanic.\n\"It's a binary swipe one way,\" she says.\n\"The worry there is, if you ignore a particular game, is that going to cut out a whole bunch of other games that the algorithm deemed similar?\n\"So a lot hinges on how good the algorithm is in working out what games are similar and what a player may enjoy interacting with.\"\nJodie says she has some concerns about the team's ability to keep up with the pace of new releases and ensure that its recommendations stay varied.\n\"How quickly can you update or how vast can you make that dataset to make it really effective?\" she says.\nHowever, Jodie is pleased the app will be free to use when it launches, and says that will make people \"more likely to give it a try to invest in it\".\nAndy admits that keeping the database updated will be a challenge.\nHe's also the founder of The Family Gaming Database, which adds about two games per day.\nHe expects Ludocene to update more quickly because it needs less data for each entry.\nHaving experts on board helps to identify \"blind spots\", he says, and hitting the crowdfunding goal means the project will have time to build its database before launch.\nBackers can try the full app early and any money raised above the target will go towards building extra features.\nAndy hopes the indie-focused project will ultimately help to shine a spotlight on the \"passion projects\" often made by small teams or individuals. \n\"The idea is it's kind of levelling the playing field,\" he says. \n\"Just having someone as a bit of a cheerleader to say diversity in games is really important.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

We need to sit down and move this forward.\"\nIn his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves. \nHe also criticised Canada for relying on the US for \"military protection\", and reiterated that he wanted the country to become the 51st US state.\nHe added that it \"would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear\" if Canada were to join the US as a state.\nThe White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had \"once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people\".\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. \nThe back-and-forth came during a turbulent time for markets.\nThe S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US fell a further 0.7% on Tuesday after dropping 2.7% on Monday, which was its biggest one-day drop since December.\nThe UK's FTSE 100 share index, which had edged lower earlier on Tuesday, fell further following Trump's latest comments and closed down more than 1%. The French Cac 40 index and German Dax followed a similar pattern.\nMonday's stock market sell-off had begun after Trump said the economy was in a \"transition\" when asked about whether the US was heading for a recession.\nInvestors have been concerned about the economic effects of Trump's trade policies, which it is feared could push up inflation in the US and beyond, while uncertainty leads to economic paralyisis.\nEven before Tuesday's comments, Trump's tariffs had already been causing concern for US businesses.\nOn Monday, Jason Goldstein, founder of Icarus Brewing, a small beer-maker in New Jersey that employs 50 people, told the BBC that previous tariff announcements had prompted a slew of emails from his suppliers. \nThey have been warning that price increases for everything from grain and aluminium cans are likely to be coming.\nMr Goldstein has stockpiled an extra month's supply of cans and held off on new purchases as a result of the uncertainty and rapidly changing situation.\n\"It's definitely a worrying time for us,\" he said.\n\"Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.\"",

        "article_text": "An argument in the White House tore apart the US alliance with Ukraine, shook European leaders and highlighted JD Vance's key role in forcefully expressing Donald Trump's foreign policy. The vice-president has come out punching on the global stage - so what is it that drives his worldview?\nVance's first major foreign speech, at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, caught many by surprise.\nRather than focusing on the war raging in Ukraine, the US vice-president only briefly mentioned the bloodiest European conflict since World War Two.\nInstead, he used his debut on the international stage to berate close US allies about immigration and free speech, suggesting the European establishment was anti-democratic. He accused them of ignoring the wills of their people and questioned what shared values they were truly banding together with the US to defend.\n\"If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people,\" he warned.\nIt was a bold and perhaps unexpected way to introduce himself to the world - by angering European allies. But days later he was back in the news, at the centre of a blistering row with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of being ungrateful.\nFor those who have been studying the rise of Vance, these two episodes came as no surprise.\nThe vice-president has come to represent an intellectual wing of the conservative movement that gives expression to Trumpism and in particular how its America First mantra applies beyond its borders. In writings and interviews, Vance has expressed an ideology that seems to join the dots between American workers, global elites and the role of the US in the wider world.\nOn the campaign trail with Donald Trump last year, Vance spent much of his time sharply criticising Democrats - the usual attack-dog duties that traditionally get dished out to running mates - and sparring with reporters.\nAnd while Elon Musk's outsized and unconventional role in the Trump administration initially overshadowed him, that Munich speech and the Oval Office showdown have raised the profile of Trump's deputy.\nIt's also led to questions about the winding ideological journey he's made during his years in the conservative movement - and what he truly believes now.\n\"He's much more of a pragmatist than an ideologue,\" said James Orr, associate professor of philosophy of religion at the University of Cambridge and a friend whom Vance has described as his \"British sherpa\".\n\"He's able to articulate what is and is not in the American interest,\" Orr said. \"And the American interest is not the interest of some abstract utopia or matrix of propositions and ideas, but the American people.\"\nVance has repeatedly returned to this \"America First\" - or perhaps \"Americans First\" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.\nAt the Republican National Convention last summer, for example, he lamented how in small towns across the US \"jobs were sent overseas and children were sent to war\". And he attacked then-President Joe Biden, saying: \"For half a century, he's been a champion of every single policy initiative to make America weaker and poorer.\"\nBut Vance is also someone who, after a tough upbringing in an Ohio family with Appalachian roots and sudden fame on the back of a bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has tried out many different views.\nNot only is he a former \"Never Trumper\" who described the US president in 2016 as \"reprehensible\" and \"an idiot\", his book places much of the blame for the plight of the rural poor squarely on the choices made by individuals.\nMore recently he's shifted that blame to elites \u2013 a group he's variously defined as Democrats, conventional Republicans, liberals, corporate leaders, globalists and academics.\nIn speeches, Vance regularly argues that \"America is not just an idea\u2026 America is a nation.\"\nHe couples this statement with an anecdote about his family's ancestral graveyard in Kentucky, where he says he, his wife and their children will one day be buried, arguing that family and homeland are more important than some of America's traditional core ideas.\nIn Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.\nRod Dreher, a conservative American writer who is also a friend of the vice-president, said Vance's thinking arises from a belief that \"moderate normie Republicans\u2026 failed to offer anything to stop the so-called forever wars, and they also failed to offer anything to ordinary Americans like where he comes from, who are suffering economically from globalism and from the effects of mass migration and fentanyl\".\n\"He got red-pilled, so to speak, by Donald Trump,\" Dreher told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme this week.\n\"Red-pilled\" is internet slang for suddenly waking up to a supposedly hidden truth, as featured in The Matrix movies. It's commonly used by those on the right online who believe they have special access to reality and that people with liberal, centrist or establishment views are uncritical thinkers.\nVance is a vice-president who, more than his boss, seems extremely plugged into internet culture. He's an enthusiastic user of X, often jumping directly into arguments rather than using it, as many politicians do, as a platform for announcements.\nHis appearances on fringe right-wing podcasts, while he was trying to drum up support for a Senate run, provided fodder for his opponents, as did provocative trollish comments such as that the US was being run by \"childless cat ladies\".\nMarried to the daughter of Indian immigrants, he has rejected and been rejected by members of the alt-right even if he does echo some of their views. However, he does have friends and allies both at the top of Silicon Valley and in some of its lesser known corners.\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, he was brought into the world of venture capital by influential Silicon Valley conservative Peter Thiel, who later funded his US Senate campaign.\nHe has cited people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, a key guru in the \"neo-reactionary\" movement which dreams up fantasies of technologically-assisted, hyper-capitalist societies led by powerful monarchs.\nHis familiarity with the internet's fringes was further demonstrated when he spread false rumours about immigrants eating pets and an allegation about Ukrainian corruption - which the BBC traced back to Moscow.\n\"He sort of stews in this online world,\" said Cathy Young, a writer for the conservative, anti-Trump media outlet The Bulwark.\nAt the same time, Young said, his anecdote about family graveyards and homeland suggests another political tendency - a \"disturbing undertone of nativism\".\n\"That bothers some people and rightly so,\" she said. \"Part of the American legacy is that we are a nation of immigrants. [Former Republican President] Ronald Reagan talked about that, about one of the distinctive things about this country is that anyone can come here from any part of the world and become an American.\"\nVance's \"Americans First\" thinking clearly extends to the issue of the war in Ukraine. When he was a senator, he was often critical of America's involvement in the war and the huge sums spent on it, his former Senate colleague Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, recalled.\n\"His position then was very much like what it is now\u2026 that the conflict must end,\" Hawley told the BBC. \"It needs to end in a way that's maximally advantageous to the security of the United States and it needs to end in a way that gets our European allies to take increased responsibility.\"\nVance regularly accused the Biden administration of being more interested in Ukraine than in stemming illegal immigration. Writing in 2022, during his Senate campaign and after the Russian invasion, he said: \"I will be damned if I am going to prioritise Ukraine's eastern border right now when our own southern border is engulfed by a human tsunami of illegal migrants.\"\nHis views burst out into the open during that dramatic argument with President Zelensky in the Oval Office. Vance accused Zelensky of lacking respect, of sending politicians on a \"propaganda tour\" of Ukraine and of being insufficiently thankful for US aid.\n\"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,\" he told the Ukrainian president.\nThe argument left European leaders scrambling to defend Zelensky, while also trying to maintain negotiations over a possible peace deal.\nVance then prompted widespread outrage from allies when he poured scorn on the idea of security guarantees in the form of troops \"from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".\nHe later denied he was talking about the UK or France, the only two European countries that have publicly stated their willingness to send peacekeepers to Ukraine.\nBut the vice-president's willingness to step on the toes of allies reflect a world view which, in his words, has little time for \"moralisms about 'this country is good', 'this country is bad'\".\n\"That doesn't mean you have to have a complete moral blind spot, but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that you're dealing with, and there's a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country,\" he told a New York Times columnist last year.\nHis tone has shifted from the two years he spent in the US Senate before being picked by Trump. Democrat Cory Booker remembered Vance as \"very pragmatic and thoughtful\".\n\"That's why some of this stuff surprises me,\" Booker told the BBC.\nOthers detect the same disconnect.\nDavid Frum, now a writer for The Atlantic magazine, said that Vance's views have changed significantly from when he first commissioned the former marine, who was attending Ohio State University at the time, to write for his website on conservative politics more than 15 years ago.\n\"He was not in any way the culture warrior that he is today,\" Frum said.\nFrum, a former George W Bush speechwriter and staunch critic of Trump, said that Vance's view of Russia represented \"ideological admiration\".\nIn Munich, as he spoke about free speech, the vice-president cited cases involving conservatives and Christians in Western countries but avoided any mention of Russia's harsh clampdowns on expression.\nVance and his allies reject that he is sympathetic to Putin.\n\"I've never once argued that Putin is a kind and friendly person,\" Vance, then an Ohio senator, said in a speech at the 2024 Munich Security Conference.\n\"We don't have to agree with him. We can contest him and we often will contest him,\" he said. \"But the fact that he's a bad guy does not mean we can't engage in basic diplomacy and prioritising America's interests.\"\nThe BBC has asked the White House for comment on Vance's stance in relation to Ukraine and Russia.\nA quick end to the conflict in Ukraine is, in Vance's view, not only about putting a stop to billions of dollars being spent thousands of miles away.\nHe himself has said that there are bigger issues for the US and its friends to focus on than Ukraine, namely the threat of China, which he has called \"our most significant competitor... for the next 20 or 30 years\".\nVance's views on Ukraine and his willingness to publicly air them provided a dramatic moment in the early days of Trump's second presidential term.\nBut it also offered a vivid illustration of the vice-president's ideology, his prominence in the Trump administration and how he views America's place in the world.\nWith reporting by Rachel Looker and Anthony Zurcher in Washington and Lily Jamali in San Francisco\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Some people who stop eating meat have reported unpleasant effects when they return to it. Can your body forget how to digest flesh?\nEating less meat is one of the simplest ways to reduce your carbon footprint.\nIf everyone in the UK moved to a low-meat diet, eating less than 50g, or one Cumberland sausage\u2019s worth of meat a day, it would save as much carbon as if eight million cars were parked for good, researchers have calculated. Data from the UK government shows that meat consumption is dropping \u2013 between 1980 and 2022, consumption of beef, pork, and lamb fell by 62% \u2013 and though the reasons cited vary, and may have more to do with rising costs than an environmental conscientiousness, more and more people are clearly experimenting with saying no to meat.\nBut if you go a long time without eating it, does that change your body's ability to digest it? Vegetarians and vegans sometimes post on social media, asking whether going back to meat could cause stomach pain, bloating, and other symptoms. Others weigh in with their own experiences, and a great, late-night whirlwind of curiosity and cramps is born.\nHowever, there isn\u2019t much research on whether consuming meat after a long break can trigger an upset stomach, says Sander Kersten, a professor of nutrition at Cornell University in the US. \"A lack of evidence doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it's just that people haven't studied it,\" he reflects. \"That's not always a satisfying situation or answer, but it's just what you have to deal with sometimes.\"\nIt is possible \u2013 though it is very rare \u2013 to be allergic to meat. Alpha-gal syndrome, in which the immune system recognises animal proteins as invaders, can lead to anaphylaxis and death. But this allergy, which can crop up after a lifetime of cheerful meat eating, is not related to switching to a low-meat diet. You can, for example, develop the condition after a tick bite.\nFor many who are avoiding meat, discovering that they have unknowingly consumed it can be emotionally painful \u2013 it can feel like a personal violation, says Kersten, who is a vegetarian himself. \"That would make some people extremely sad,\" he explains. \" I don't know if that would lead to physical symptoms. It certainly could trigger a lot of anger.\"\nBut when you consider the biology of digestion, it is not as plausible as you might imagine that the body could, over a long period of time, lose the ability to digest meat. Meat is generally very easily digested, unlike the fibre in fruits, vegetables, and legumes. To break that up, our bodies require help from our microbiome, whose microbes do possess the enzymes necessary for digesting it.\nMoreover, the enzymes used to digest plant proteins are the same as those used on meat proteins. These enzymes recognise and sever particular chemical bonds in proteins. Whether they come from plants or animals, the proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids. Enzymes can generally break them up no matter where they came from.\nThis process is different from the case of, say, animal milk sugars like lactose. To digest lactose, your body requires a specific enzyme called lactase, and people who do not produce enough of the enzyme, making them lactose intolerants, can suffer a tummy upset after eating dairy products.\nBut with meat proteins, it does not make sense to think of the body somehow ceasing to make the enzymes necessary to digest a hamburger comfortably \u2013 they're always there, breaking down any protein that comes through, be it from pea, soybeans, or steaks, says Kersten.\nThe human gut microbiome does morph and change depending on what its host eats, though. Sometimes this means that the specific types of bacteria there change; sometimes it's just that the microbes make other enzymes. While there are differences between the microbiomes of omnivores and vegetarians and vegans, they do not seem to be radically divergent, so long as the omnivores consume a variety of plants, research has found.\nMicrobiomes can shift quickly as a result of dietary changes, however \u2013 one study in which people switched to a fully animal-based diet showed that a shift away from their baseline microbiome was visible within a day (it swiftly reverted back to normal once the diet ended). Subjects were encouraged to report any discomfort they felt, but nothing made it into the paper.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How a month of abstinence can lead to meat disgust\n\u2022 The rise and fall and possible rise of the oyster\n\u2022 The complicated history of gelatine\nIf anything, it's the sudden consumption of large amounts of fibre after a long hiatus that could cause digestive problems. It's better to ease into such dietary changes. \"Depending on the fibre, you can have some pretty strong reactions to it,\" says Kersten.\nIn short, worrying about your body somehow losing the ability to digest meat shouldn't impair any plans you have to extend Veganuary into the spring. If you're among those who've had an upset stomach after eating meat following a long hiatus, a loss of enzymes is not likely to be the culprit, though this phenomenon remains understudied, Kersten says.\n\"The body is quite adaptable,\" he continues. \"It can do more than you think.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Arriving in red will be cool' - Hamilton's Melbourne excitment\nLewis Hamilton's move to Ferrari is the single biggest storyline of the 2025 Formula 1 season.\nThe sport's biggest star - the only driver who truly transcends the sport - has joined its most iconic team, and interest in how their partnership develops is stratospheric.\nThese are the key questions as Hamilton begins his new adventure.\nHamilton signed with Ferrari in January 2024, just over six months after sealing a new contract with Mercedes.\nIt was the talks over that new Mercedes deal that led to the Ferrari move.\nMercedes wanted to offer Hamilton only a one-year contract - team boss Toto Wolff was planning for the future. The seven-time world champion knew he wanted to stay in F1 longer.\nThey compromised on what is known as a \"one-plus-one\" contract - a firm deal for 2024 with an option for 2025.\nBut Mercedes' reticence to commit to him led Hamilton to consider his future. He had always had a hankering after driving for Ferrari and he has a close relationship with their team boss Frederic Vasseur, which dates back 20 years to their time in the junior categories together.\nHamilton's single biggest ambition is to win the record eighth title of which he feels he was robbed by race director Michael Masi making up the rules and mishandling a late safety-car period in the 2021 title decider in Abu Dhabi.\nMercedes had not furnished him with a car in which he could do that since, so he had plenty of doubts on that front, too.\nHamilton approached Ferrari and the team were keen to do a deal. So when they offered him a longer contract - at least to the end of 2026 - and a close to 50% pay rise to a reputed salary of 65m euros (\u00a355m), it was a no-brainer.\nThe fact that Ferrari had finished 2023 in stronger shape than Mercedes made the decision even easier.\nIn 2024, Hamilton was comprehensively out-qualified by a team-mate for the first time in his career, ending the season 19-5 down to George Russell in their one-lap head-to-head, at an average deficit of 0.171 seconds.\nAlthough both won two races, Hamilton finished 22 points adrift in the championship.\nIt was a confusing situation, because in 2022 and 2023, the two had been closely matched in qualifying, and one of them finished ahead in the championship one year and the other the other.\nThe bottom line is that Hamilton struggled with the characteristics of the 2024 Mercedes more than Russell.\nThe car had slow-corner understeer. The way to counteract this was to slide the rear on entry to promote turn-in. But doing that generates rear tyre temperature, which reduces grip, a problem that increases over time. Hamilton was less able to deal with this than Russell.\nOn top of this, there is no question that, frustrated by his qualifying deficit, Hamilton would sometimes push too hard when it mattered right at the end of qualifying. That led to mistakes, which further harmed his performance.\nThe Mercedes engineers felt that there was something about the general characteristics of the current generation of cars and their ground-effect design philosophy that does not marry as well with Hamilton's style as the previous generations of cars.\nBut just because that was the case last year does not mean it will be the same this year at Ferrari. It may depend on how the car behaves.\nEqually, it's impossible to know how much of an effect psychology had - Hamilton had to do a whole year with Mercedes, the longest season in history, knowing he was leaving at the end of the season, and with his heart effectively already elsewhere.\nCertainly Vasseur believes that is too important to ignore. And Hamilton is of the same opinion.\nHamilton turned 40 in January and is the second oldest driver in F1.\nOf course, athletic performance declines over time, but Fernando Alonso - who is three and a half years older than Hamilton - insists his age is not a problem, and there is no evidence in his case that it is.\nAlonso is still performing at an extremely high level, and produced some outstanding drives last year - as he did in 2023, when again he was older than Hamilton is now.\nThere is no evidence or reason to suggest Hamilton's age will have a deleterious effect on him.\nLewis Hamilton was sixth fastest on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain at the end of February\nHamilton does not speak Italian. He is trying to learn, but it is unlikely the fact he cannot speak the language will have a serious effect on him.\nFor a start, all technical debriefs in Ferrari are conducted in English. Vasseur also does not speak Italian.\nMichael Schumacher could not speak Italian - and he won five world titles with Ferrari and is their most successful driver. Neither could Nigel Mansell. He won on his debut with Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix. He became a folk hero in his two years with the team and is still idolised as 'Il Leone' (the Lion) now.\nVasseur says: \"You know that 99% of the job is in English. It's good to speak a little bit of Italian for the mechanics and the relationship in the team but I am not sure it is crucial for the performance.\"\nCharles Leclerc finished third in the 2024 drivers' championship on 356 points. Hamiton was seventh with 223\nHamilton's partner/rival in the other Ferrari is Charles Leclerc, a 27-year-old from Monaco who has won eight grands prix and set 26 pole positions since joining the team in 2019.\nLeclerc is a Ferrari protege - he has been nurtured by the team since he was a teenager. He is richly talented and regarded as possibly the fastest driver over one lap in F1 at the moment, and his career statistics back that up.\nLeclerc does not have such a big offset between his qualifying and race success stats because he is bad at racing. He has it because his ability and raw speed has often meant he has qualified the car higher than its competitive level can sustain over a race distance.\nHamilton is also a brilliant qualifier - he holds the all-time record for pole positions. And in many ways the two drivers are very similar. Both of them have an ability to produce 'wow' performances in qualifying - laps that leave people open-mouthed, thinking, 'where did that come from?'\nHamilton might have to accept that there is a strong chance he will be out-qualified by Leclerc over the season. But he will be confident that what he probably considers his greater race-craft and experience will see him through over a season.\nHe says: \"Charles is very professional, very embedded in this team. He is very fast and I am completely aware of that. You have seen his qualifying laps.\n\"I told him in Bahrain many years ago (in 2019) he had a bright future ahead of him.  It is not going to be easy to beat him. Especially in his home. But we will work together and have some great races, I hope.\"\nHamilton cannot control whether Ferrari build him a competitive car. And if they don't, the minimum that could be considered success would be to come out on top against Leclerc.\nBut Hamilton has not gone to Ferrari to score a few podium finishes. He wants an eighth world title. He's confident he and the team can do it. And given his level of career success, and Ferrari's history in F1, nothing less than a championship will suffice.\nHe says: \"This team already has an insane legacy and are not short of championships they have won. They have a winning mentality in their DNA.\n\"The competition is fierce. It is going to be close. but I have a great team-mate, the energy I have seen from the team, there is magic here.\n\"It is going to take a lot of hard work and everyone is putting that in. But it is also about belief. Everyone in this team dreams of winning with Ferrari.\n\"I have worked with two title-winning teams before,  I know what one looks and feels like. The passion is like nothing you have ever seen. They have got everything they need to win a championship. It is just about putting the pieces together.\"\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat is at stake at under-pressure Red Bull?\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University. \nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nIn his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \n\nCarney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nHe is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nHis political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",

At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",

        "article_text": "The Democratic Republic of Congo appears to be turning to the US in its latest efforts to find an ally in its fight against advancing M23 rebels.\nRecognising that the White House of President Donald Trump is interested in transactional relationships - and seeing the proposed Ukraine-US mineral deal - the resource-rich DR Congo is hoping to strike its own agreement with Washington.\nIt has also been reported that Trump is soon to appoint the father-in-law of his daughter, Tiffany, to a key role in the region.\nCongolese government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya confirmed to the BBC's Newsday programme that his country wanted to bring the US on board and supply it \"with some critical minerals\". \n\"Of course... we can also talk about security,\" he added.\nDR Congo is in trouble militarily.\nM23 fighters - backed by neighbouring Rwanda - have made major advances in parts of the mineral-rich east of the country.\nRegional forces - first from east and then southern Africa - which were supposed to provide some help have failed to hold back the rebels. The M23 has talked about advancing west in a bid to seize the capital, Kinshasa, even though it is 1,600km (1,000 miles) away.\nGiven the dangers, it is not surprising that President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi might be looking at ways to shore up his position.\nOn 22 February, Tshisekedi was reported by the New York Times to have said that the Trump administration had shown interest in a deal involving strategic minerals.\nThe day before, the Africa-USA Business Council - a lobby group - wrote to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on behalf of a Congolese senator describing a possible deal that included an \"economic and military partnership\".\nDR Congo is estimated to have $24tn-worth (\u00a319tn) of untapped resources - including cobalt, gold and copper.\nThe country is currently the world's largest supplier of cobalt - which has defence and aerospace applications as well as being essential for batteries in electric vehicles - but most of this goes to China.

Is Trump mulling a minerals deal with conflict-hit DR Congo?17 hours agoShareSaveDamian ZaneBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesCongolese soldiers - some seen here after being captured by the rebels in January -  have fared poorly against the M23The Democratic Republic of Congo appears to be turning to the US in its latest efforts to find an ally in its fight against advancing M23 rebels.Recognising that the White House of President Donald Trump is interested in transactional relationships - and seeing the proposed Ukraine-US mineral deal - the resource-rich DR Congo is hoping to strike its own agreement with Washington.It has also been reported that Trump is soon to appoint the father-in-law of his daughter, Tiffany, to a key role in the region.Congolese government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya confirmed to the BBC's Newsday programme that his country wanted to bring the US on board and supply it \"with some critical minerals\". It also has significant lithium, tantalum and uranium deposits, which also have military uses.Though the US is investing in a huge infrastructure project - the Lobito corridor - designed to transport goods out of central Africa to a port in Angola, its companies are not involved in mining in DR Congo.As China dominates the Congolese mineral sector, there could be \"a widening strategic gap, where adversarial nations continue to monopolise Africa's resources\", the letter to Rubio said.What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?Who is M23 leader Sultani Makenga?Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR CongoIn theory, DR Congo could offer favourable terms to US companies to exploit the resources. The M23 has talked about advancing west in a bid to seize the capital, Kinshasa, even though it is 1,600km (1,000 miles) away.Given the dangers, it is not surprising that President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi might be looking at ways to shore up his position.On 22 February, Tshisekedi was reported by the New York Times to have said that the Trump administration had shown interest in a deal involving strategic minerals.The day before, the Africa-USA Business Council - a lobby group - wrote to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on behalf of a Congolese senator describing a possible deal that included an \"economic and military partnership\".What could be in it for the US?DR Congo is estimated to have $24tn-worth (\u00a319tn) of untapped resources - including cobalt, gold and copper.The country is currently the world's largest supplier of cobalt - which has defence and aerospace applications as well as being essential for batteries in electric vehicles - but most of this goes to China. He is the father of Michael Boulos, who is married to Trump's daughter Tiffany, and has been serving as Trump's senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs since December.Among his business interests is a Nigeria-based company that specialises in the distribution of motor vehicles and equipment across West Africa - and he is expected to fly to Kinshasa at some point in the next few weeks.More about the conflict in DR Congo:'I risked drowning to flee conscription by Congolese rebels'Rebels leave families devastated in wake of DR Congo advanceHow DR Congo's Tutsis become foreigners in their own countryThe evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR CongoGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsAfrica DailyFocus on AfricaDemocratic Republic of CongoAfricaUnited States",

The focus is to change his mind and everybody's.\"\nAmorim, who Ratcliffe described as an \"outstanding young manager\", says he has a good relationship the United board. \n\"I think we are really blunt and honest with each other, we are quite similar in that,\" said Amorim, ahead of his side's Europa League match against Real Sociedad. \n\"I always felt the support of the board, especially Sir Jim.\"\n'Some Man Utd players not good enough & overpaid'\nMan Utd's new \u00a32bn stadium - all the key reaction and best images\nMan Utd's new stadium - 11 key questions\nThis video can not be played\nSir Jim Ratcliffe: The Interview\nBBC Sport chief football reporter Simon Stone:\nToday was the first opportunity to talk about the comments with United head coach Ruben Amorim.\nI didn't mention any of the players by name when I asked Amorim about it, but he did.\n\"If we are being honest in this moment, everybody, me, all the players, we are underperforming this season,\" said the former Sporting boss.\n\"We can always change that and I include myself in that part of the underperforming.\n\"You are talking about players like Casemiro, for example, that won everything and we know these kind of players can play so much better.\"\nThe former Real Madrid great is known to be the highest paid current United player and still has another year left on his contract.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport earlier this week, Ratcliffe spoke about the difficulties that Ineos have encountered since their investment in the club.\nAsked whether he understood the frustration of supporters following the fans' protests before Sunday's match against Arsenal, Ratcliffe said change took time and cited an example of \"inheriting\" transfer deals that the club are yet to pay off.\n\"It's not a light switch. I'll give you an example, if you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn't buy, we are buying Antony, we are buying Casemiro, we are buying Andre Onana, we are buying Rasmus Hojlund, we are buying Jadon Sancho.\n\"These are all things from the past but whether we like it or not we have inherited those things and we have to sort it out. For Sancho, who obviously now plays for Chelsea - and we pay half his wages - we are paying \u00a317m to buy him in the summer.\"\nAsked later in the interview about 'inheriting' players, Ratcliffe said the club had - in some situations - spent too much on players that are not good enough but did not specify any players. \n\"Some are not good enough, some are probably overpaid,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"But for us to mould a squad, that we are fully responsible for and accountable for, will take time.\"\nFull transcript of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's interview\nAmorim confirmed midfielder Manuel Ugarte would return to the squad for the Europa League last-16 second leg against Real Sociedad on Thursday (20:00 GMT).\nThe Uruguayan missed Sunday's 1-1 draw against Arsenal at Old Trafford.\nHowever, Leny Yoro - who came off at half-time against the Gunners - is unavailable.\nMason Mount, whose last appearance came in a 2-1 win against Manchester City on 15 December, has returned to training but will not be available for selection against Sociedad. \nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "It was after 21:00 on Tuesday night in Moscow when the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined the Ukrainian and American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia.\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the Kremlin appeared to be still weighing its response to the proposals.\nRussia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declined to be drawn into specifics, saying that \"the formation of the position of the Russian Federation [would] take place inside the Russian Federation\".\nAnd Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov skirted the issue. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" he said, adding Moscow was \"acquainting itself\" with the joint statement issued in Jeddah.\nThere are reports that US envoy Steve Witkoff could travel to Moscow on Thursday, and Peskov said the press would be kept informed. Other than this, it was no comment from the Kremlin.\nPresident Vladimir Putin is no doubt thinking carefully about whether to accept the ceasefire proposal, reject it, or demand amendments to it.\nThe idea of turning down - or amending - the ceasefire proposal seems to be gaining most traction among commentators. \n\"If [Putin] accepts the US suggestion, it will lead to a dangerous situation,\" pro-Kremlin pundit and former Putin aide Sergei Markov told the BBC, arguing that the Russian army currently has the upper hand on the front line and may lose it.\nThere are also concerns that Ukraine could use the month-long ceasefire to rearm, so Russia may put forward some conditions, such as demanding an end to the Western supply of weapons to Kyiv.\n\"The condition should be that during this period, an embargo must be introduced on arms supplies to Ukraine... Europe should support a ceasefire in Europe, not with words, but with actions,\" Mr Markov told Russian media.\nIf he were to accept the proposal, Mr Markov suggests public opinion could be a factor. Russian society is \"tired of the war\", he told the BBC.\nWhile it is true that some recent surveys show a growing percentage of the Russian population is in favour of carrying out peace talks with Ukraine, it's far from clear that public opinion would have any sway on Putin's decision. \nAnother potential avenue for Russia would be to accept the ceasefire and then blame any violations on Ukrainian \"provocations\", in the hope of discrediting Kyiv in Trump's eyes. \nAfter Russia seized Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts were made to implement a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv. All of them failed. \nIf this attempt works, it would be unprecedented. \nAway from the Kremlin's silence, the announcement of the ceasefire proposal \u2013 the most detailed of its kind since the start of Moscow's war on Ukraine \u2013 was openly discussed in Russian media.\nIn some cases, there was jubilation over what they saw as Ukraine folding to US demands, with Komsomolskaya Pravda arguing the White House had \"completely trounced\" Kyiv.\n\"They heard from Ukraine exactly the words they wanted to hear,\" said the daily.\nStill, the overwhelming feeling among many Russian commentators and lawmakers is one of scepticism, particularly in light of the US decision to resume sending Kyiv intelligence and weapons.\nMP Viktor Sobolev said a temporary ceasefire would only play into the hands of the Ukrainians as it would allow them to \"regroup in 30 days, replenish their ranks and be replenished with drones\".\nThere has also been a push to highlight the victories of the Russian army in the Kursk region, parts of which Kyiv has occupied since last summer - and to show Russia has the upper hand on the battlefield.\nOn Wednesday morning, images of Russian soldiers recapturing Sudzha - the largest town Ukraine managed to seize in Kursk region - were ubiquitous on Russian TV and popular Telegram channels, accompanied by gushing praise for the \"daring\" work of Moscow's troops.\n\"The real conditions for negotiations are now being created by our heroic guys - all along the front line,\" said daily Moskovsky Komsomolets.\nRegardless of the chatter, the final decision \u2013 as is always the case in today's Russia \u2013 will rest with Vladimir Putin.\nHe, like Trump, is central to this deal. \"We... do not rule out the need for a telephone conversation at the highest level,\" said Peskov on Wednesday morning \u2013 meaning direct contact between the two presidents is on the cards.\nSome Russians may believe this is Trump's preferred avenue, too.\n\"By his own admission, he makes a deal only with the 'boss',\" said state broadcaster Ria Novosti.\n\"This means that there will be no deals with 'teams', 'representatives' and 'envoys'. A possible deal can only be between Putin and Trump.\"",

Some of those internal messages are repeated by players in interviews, but without context as to why Brendon is saying them - things like 'we don't care about winning' - that is nonsense. \n\"Sometimes you have got to be above the players and you have got to drag them up, and sometimes when things are going well you've got to be below them and bring them down - and that does happen, too.\" \nComments which caused a stir include Ben Duckett saying it did not matter that England lost 3-0 to India as long as they went on to win the Champions Trophy, while in September last year Harry Brook said \"if you get caught somewhere on the boundary, then who cares?\" when asked about his side's batting approach.\nBut Key added that McCullum is a \"master\" at knowing the differences between his players, such as who needs a harder approach and who thrives by being more relaxed.\n\"After the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston, an absolute rollercoaster, Brendon said something along the lines of how those close games feel like ones you've won,\" Key added.\n\"So that's why it is annoying when it is taken out of context. What he's trying to do is lift everyone, he's trying to make sure they don't walk out feeling like the world has ended because they are gutted, but they still have four Tests left to play.\"\nTest Match Special podcast: Rob Key\nStokes considered as England white-ball captain\n'Karachi a familiar low - England's rebuild starts here'\nKey also denied suggestions he and the England management had put too much focus on Test cricket which resulted in poor results from the white-ball side. \nHe said that during Joe Root's tenure as Test captain, he was often playing without his full-strength XI but this winter the selection decisions were inevitable.\n\"The white-ball team [when I started] were the best or one of the best in the world, and they had done a lot of work with an era of cricketers who were very established and experienced and knew exactly what they were doing,\" said Key.\n\"The problem that we found this winter is that we had a decision to make - and it wasn't a matter of choosing between white and red ball - it was more the fact that it is almost impossible to have your best team play in both formats now.\" \nEngland played three Tests in Pakistan in October, a white-ball series in the Caribbean started a day after that series ended and then three further Tests in New Zealand followed. \nKey said he would have made the same selections again because of the complexity of the schedule.\n\"It meant that the white-ball team suffered, but there was almost no choice,\" he said. \n\"It was either one or the other. Every step along the way we've had to make a call of 'you can only have your best team at one of these series'.\" \nKey's next significant decision will be to appoint Jos Buttler's successor as white-ball captain after he stood down at the end of the Champions Trophy. The process will take time and Key said he has not had any conversations with current Test skipper Stokes about the vacancy. \nEngland next play a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May, followed by a white-ball series against West Indies.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "You would never say Arsenal and Manchester United are having similar seasons, but Sunday's Premier League stalemate at Old Trafford was a reminder that they have something in common - a problem to solve up front.\nWhile the Gunners' attacking flaw appears to be a glaring one, in that they have played much of this campaign without a recognised centre-forward, United do have some strikers, but their regular failure to find the net has left people questioning whether they are good enough to help Ruben Amorim's side climb the table.\nWayne Rooney had sympathy for Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund when he analysed their display for his former club on Match of the Day 2, but felt Arsenal's issue again proved costly after watching them lose even more ground to Liverpool in an increasingly one-sided title race.\n\"I always feel the teams with the best number nines have the best chance of winning things,\" United's all-time record goalscorer, who won five Premier League titles, told BBC Sport.\n\"Liverpool are probably an exception to that, with the way they rotate the player they use through the middle, rather than having a regular number nine that the team is built around.\n\"The number nine is still so important for them, though. Mohamed Salah, cutting in from wide areas, is their main goalscorer but, whether it is Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota or Darwin Nunez in the centre, they all chip in with a good amount of goals.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHojlund needs more confidence to start scoring  - Rooney\nLiverpool have scored 17 more league goals than Arsenal this season - a simple statistic but a telling one, even taking into account the leaders have played one game more.\nWith Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz out for the season and another key attacker, Bukayo Saka, absent, it has been left to midfielder Mikel Merino to fill in as an emergency striker for Mikel Arteta's side in the way he did against United, this time with little effect.\nWhile the Gunners controlled the game for long periods, goalscorer Declan Rice conceded afterwards that they did not have the cutting edge needed. Rooney felt a specialist finisher was what they were missing.\n\"A proper number nine - a forward who has played there his whole life - brings  something different to any team,\" he explained.\n\"I am talking about that natural goalscoring instinct, which a player who is trying to learn the position probably doesn't have.\n\"A midfielder playing forward like Merino can get hold of the ball and bring others into play, but what a goalscorer brings is that selfishness of wanting to be in the penalty area to finish chances.\n\"As we saw on Sunday, Rice was trying to help Arsenal to fill that position, as the player who was always making forward runs and arriving in the box. He did really well in that advanced role, but he cannot always be there.\"\nDeclan Rice made six touches inside the United box, along with Jurrien Timber the joint-most by an Arsenal player\nMerino may be a midfielder, but he has scored three Premier League goals this year. Hojlund and Zirkzee have none.\nThose numbers may not suggest the answer to United's goalscoring problems lies within their current squad, but Rooney argues that any striker would find it difficult playing up front for United at present.\n\"Before they scored at the end of the first half, United had managed one shot at goal and none on target,\" Rooney said.\n\"Their problem was their lack of movement in midfield, because they could not make the passes to get up the pitch. Instead, they were forced to play balls up to Zirkzee and it was very hard for him to do anything with them.\n\"The best centre-halves, like Arsenal's are, force you under the ball in that situation or nick balls off you.\n\"If the ball is getting chipped in to you around the halfway line, which is what Zirkzee was getting, and you haven't got the support in and around you, then it is very difficult and you have to work extremely hard.\n\"Firstly, you are fighting the centre-half and holding him off you. Then you've got to get the ball under control and try to bring someone into play.\n\"If the quality of the pass up to you is not great, especially when it is coming to you around your neck like some of United's passes were, it is even harder.\n\"A lot of the time Zirkzee was getting given a 50-50 ball, the kind where you have to work wonders to win it. Ideally, what you want is your team to make a few passes and play out of the pressure, then as the striker you are getting the ball to feet, which makes it a lot easier, and you are closer to the opposition goal too.\n\"For a centre-half, if you are facing your own goal and in your own half, then it makes their job a lot easier, but if you are higher up the pitch the striker has lots more options. The defender cannot be all over you because they are afraid of giving free-kicks away.\n\"What United needed to do was get some control of the game, and get on the ball. Then the striker can make the little five yard bursts to get behind the defence, which give you a better chance of scoring.\"\nWhile Zirkzee had few sights of goal in the first half, replacement Hojlund got a couple of good opportunities to end his drought when the game opened up late on - but was unable to take them.\n\"There was one chance where his shot was blocked after he had shown fantastic movement to get to the near post,\" Rooney said.\n\"He goes once, he checks back, goes again, got across Gabriel and got a good contact on his shot, so he had done everything right. It is only a great block that stops the goal.\"\nHojlund's run to the near post - his first-time shot was blocked and flew wide\n\"The one that will be highlighted, though, is the one where Rice gets back and tackles him after the ball breaks for him in the area, and that was purely down to a lack of confidence.\n\"You see Hojlund take a touch and then he is looking up to see where he wants to put his shot when he doesn't have the time for that.\n\"That's the kind of scenario where, as a striker, if you are scoring goals you don't even have to look up - you know where the goal is.\n\"To me that really showed how much he needs a goal right now, but all he can do is keep working.\n\"I've got faith in him. He's a good player who works hard, which is really important. He needs that bit of luck as well, but once he gets a break then more goals will follow.\n\"As a striker for Manchester United, when you are not scoring goals there is a lot of pressure and a lot of people questioning if you can do it for United.\n\"The best thing for Hojlund to do is simplify it. Making runs into the penalty box is as easy at it comes. There was an attack late on against Arsenal I highlighted on Match of the Day 2 where Alejandro Garnacho is about to put in a cross and Hojlund needs to have that desire to get in the box.\n\"He goes to go, then for some reason he stops. If he carries on his run then he is in the right place around about the six yard box to get a tap-in for the winner when Bruno Fernandes' shot is saved.\n\"When you are short of confidence you have got to make sure you make it into the penalty area and put yourself in a position where you can score, so that is something he can improve on.\nThe arrow shows the run Rooney thinks Hojlund should have made\n\"We are still waiting to see Hojlund find his feet for United, but it's important to point out that the whole team have not been at their best.\n\"I feel for him from that point of view because, nine times out of 10, forwards rely on their team-mates for service.\n\"United have not been playing well or creating enough chances, so he has not been in a team dominating possession, sliding balls in behind the defence or putting balls into the box.\"\nOne way for both clubs to solve their attacking issues will be in the summer transfer window, but it is not just United and Arsenal who seemingly need a new striker.\nChelsea are also being linked with a string of number nines, and even Liverpool are supposedly lining up a goalscorer as a potential replacement for Salah, whose contract is up at the end of the season.\nIpswich's Liam Delap is reportedly being targeted by several clubs. The 22-year-old is a player Rooney considered signing in the past, when he was a teenager available on loan from Manchester City in 2021.\n\"Liam is someone I looked at for the clubs I've been at, and he is a fantastic player,\" Rooney said. \"He is a powerful lad and has a great physique to play the role he does.\n\"He probably surprised a few people by going to Ipswich, but he has scored some great goals.\n\"Ipswich are struggling in the league, so it is not always that easy for him, and I have seen a few games where he can get frustrated because he is not getting the service - exactly the problem I was talking about with United.\n\"But Liam has a massive amount of potential and I am sure he is going to have a fantastic career.\n\"I can see why the top clubs are being linked with him, but they are all going for the same players, because there is a shortage of number nines.\"\nLiam Delap has scored 10 Premier League goals this season\nIt does seem like the same strikers are on the summer shortlist of several clubs.\nArsenal failed with a January bid for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, while Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta has been talked about as a target for the Gunners and United.\n\"Mateta is a big, strong lad who scores a lot of goals,\" Rooney said. \"From watching Arsenal over the past few games in the Premier League, they have put a lot of balls into the box without having anyone to get on the end of them. I am sure he would help from that point of view.\"\nAs well as finding someone who suits your playing style, availability is another obstacle.\nNewcastle's Alexander Isak is often viewed as the answer to Arsenal's lack of strikers, and he has also been touted as a potential Salah replacement.\n\"Isak would fit into any team,\" Rooney said. \"He has been fantastic over the past couple of years and scored a lot of goals. His link-up play and movement is brilliant too.\n\"You look at any team in the Premier League, and whether it is United and Arsenal or Liverpool then he would improve them, but I also think it will be very difficult to get him out of Newcastle. Why would they sell him?\"",

        "article_text": "For many, constant bad news numbs our reaction to climate disasters. But research suggests that a new type of immersive storytelling about nature told through virtual reality (VR) can both build empathy and inspire us to act.\nI'm crying into a VR headset. I've just watched a VR experience that tells the story of a young pangolin called Chestnut, as she struggles to survive in the Kalahari Desert. A vast, dusty landscape extends around me in all directions, and her armoured body seems vulnerable as she curls up, alone, to sleep. Her story is based on the life of a real pangolin that was tracked by scientists.\nChestnut hasn't found enough to ants to eat, since insect numbers have dwindled due to climate change. Her sunny voice remains optimistic even as exhaustion takes over. In the final scenes, she dies, and I must clumsily lift my headset to dab my eyes.\nVR experiences can be a lot more than just moving or fun, research suggests. Scientists are discovering that nature experiences shown through VR can affect our attitudes and behaviours \u2013\u00a0and that these arresting depictions of nature might nudge us into taking better care of our environment.\nMy powerful VR experience with Chestnut's story was made by HabitatXR, a production studio based in Johannesburg. Founder Ulrico Grech-Cumbo launched the company in 2016, following many trips to the African bush during which he captured its green, dusty landscapes and iconic wildlife on camera. He had experience working in VR, and realised that he could translate his footage into something more immersive.\n\"I thought it would be a hell of a lot of fun being inside a natural history documentary,\" he says.\nHabitatXR is just one of the companies experimenting with VR technology to create nature experiences. Wild Immersion, based in Paris, take their immersive movies of underwater worlds and snowscapes to science centres and aquariums. And UK artist collective Marshmallow Laser Feast have created immersive experiences that show the forest through the eyes of a dragonfly, and take the viewer \"inside\" a tree.\nThe nature experiences developed by HabitatXR are situated in a virtual version of the African savannah. In one, I find myself in a misty landscape dotted with squat, flat-topped acacias. Suddenly a rhinoceros emerges, dangerously close, its enormous horn scything the air as it walks towards me and lowers its head.\nDespite the pixelated graphics, I instinctively look down to where my knee should be \u2013\u00a0to where the rhino's horn ought to have grazed it. The beast lets out a breathy snort and, mercifully, retreats.\nI'm beginning to see how emotionally compelling this kind of storytelling can be. And I'm not alone \u2013 when an environmental NGO took one of HabitatXR's VR experiences to a fundraising gala, Grech-Cumbo saw the powerful effect it had on those who watched it. \"High net worth individuals were strolling around with expensive watches and glasses of champagne,\" he says. \"We'd sit them down in a dark room and put a VR headset on them, and five minutes later, they'd be crying. That's not something I've ever seen a film do [to] 50 people at a time.\"\nGrech-Cumbo's observation is reflected in scientific research, which finds that VR tends to trigger stronger emotions than other media. Engaging in a VR experience about a Syrian refugee elicits more intense emotions than reading an article showing the same images and information, for example.\nThere may be particular benefits to VR content that deals with nature. One nature experience depicting a forest of majestic trees, for example, made people more likely to take action to protect the environment, such as signing a petition on plastic reduction or taking flyers to spread the word about the petition. Another, of a journey through the Amazon rainforest, found that participants who experienced the forest through VR reported feeling more connected to nature and expressed greater commitment to the environment than participants who watched the same rainforest visuals on a standard computer screen.\nVR is particularly good at making us feel a complex and impactful emotion: awe. Psychologists describe awe as the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your current understanding of the world. It can make us feel wonder, but also uncertainty. And research suggests that experiencing awe can make us more inclined to make personal sacrifices for the environment. \nHype Metre\nVirtual reality shows potential to spark powerful emotional connections with the natural world. Research suggests nature stories experienced through VR can elicit awe, build empathy and inspire environmental action more effectively than traditional media.\nHowever, VR technology remains relatively inaccessible. Only around 10 million headsets are sold globally each year, and expensive devices such as the Apple Vision Pro (\u00a33,499 in the UK, or $3,499 in the US) limit mainstream adoption. Questions remain about how virtual nature experiences might affect our relationship with our real local environments, and studies indicate VR nature can't boost our mood in the same way real nature does.\nThese recent scientific analyses of awe build on a long history of its exploration in philosophy and the arts. It particularly obsessed certain 18th-Century poets and writers, whose experience of what they called \"the sublime\" was often inspired by nature.\u00a0(Learn more about the power of awe in this article by Richard Fisher about the upsides of feeling small.)\nAlice Chirico, a psychologist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy, has studied VR's ability to make us feel awe, and how this might impact people's relationship to the natural world. She has found that VR nature experiences prompt us to feel awe when they induce a sense of vastness \u2013 like huge mountains and tall trees. In another study, she found that these kinds of awe-inspiring virtual nature experiences made people more likely to take social actions geared towards protecting the environment\nAlice Chirico, a psychologist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy, has studied VR's ability to make us feel awe, and how this might impact people's relationship to the natural world. She has found that VR nature experiences prompt us to feel awe when they induce a sense of vastness \u2013\u00a0like huge mountains and tall trees. In another study, she found that these kinds of awe-inspiring virtual nature experiences made people more likely to take social actions geared towards protecting the environment.\n\"Awe is able to support positive attitudes towards the environment and also a sense of attachment towards the environment \u2013 a kind of nature connectedness, the feeling of being included within something that is much bigger than us,\" Chirico says.\u00a0\nVR can do this in ways that other media formats can't, she says, because it can drop us into a story and create the illusion that we're part of it. VR \"manipulates the sense of presence\", Chirico says, creating \"the illusion of being really there in that specific place in that specific moment, as if it is reality itself\".\nThe immersive advantage VR may have over other media such as articles or videos could have real world impacts. Researchers have found that people are more inclined to save energy at home when they learn about the need for pro-environmental behaviours through VR, rather than from an article or video. They suggest that the difference is because of what they call the \"presence mechanism\" \u2013 the feeling of truly being inanother world.\nThese experiences typically bring the viewer up close to their subject \u2013 face to face with a gorilla, or inside a migrating wildebeest herd. Feelings of immersion in such scenes might be limited by current technology, however. For me, the horn-swinging rhino was striking, though not visually believable. Researchers suggest that rich, high resolution imagery is important for immersing the viewer in the experience. VR tech likely to improve in the coming years, as accessories heighten the realism of virtual worlds. There is even a glove able to convince its wearer that a spider is crawling across their hand, for example.\nDespite decades of excitement over VR, the technology has struggled to break into the mainstream. Even today, relatively few people have access to VR headsets, with only around 10 million of the devices sold across the globe every year. Reports suggest that Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro headset, for example \u2013 which costs $3,499 in the US and \u00a33,499 in the UK \u2013 has achieved a fraction of its expected sales.\n\"Even though I've been working in this world for 10 years, there's probably a nine out of 10 chance that if I put a headset on a person, it's their first time wearing a VR headset,\" Grech-Cumbo says.\nEven if the technology were more accessible, could dazzling virtual experiences undermine our appreciation for local, everyday nature? It is important, Grech-Cumbo acknowledges, that eye-catching VR nature experiences don't distract us from the real forests, parks and mountain ranges near to where we live.\n\"This is about understanding our own relationship with nature, wherever we are,\" he says.\nWith this in mind, HabitatXR is now working on a project that will bring virtual nature into cities, starting with Johannesburg. Their plans for a VR \"Zoo of the Future\" will include a web of life experience, in which people will be able to virtually pick up individual species \u2013 flowers, grasses, bugs, animals \u2013 from an ecosystem map, and see their ecological links to other species.\n\"[We want to] put an emphasis on the fact that we are all connected \u2013\u00a0whether we believe it or not, whether we like it or not,\" Grech-Cumbo says.\nChirico emphasises that VR's goal should not be to replace reality and nature. There are lots of things virtual nature can't do. Studies suggest it can't boost our mood in the same way real nature can, for instance. However, it could be democratising. \"People don't [always] have full or easy access to nature, so the goal is to provide it in a cheaper way,\" Chirico says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery\n\u2022 In Cleveland, mushrooms digest entire houses\n\u2022 How beer sludge is being turned into vegan milk\nIn the US, for example, 100 million people, including 28 million children, reportedly do not have access to parks close to their homes. VR nature experiences might, in such cases, enable people to interact with an unreal yet informative and inspiring version of nature. Plus, adds Chirico, \"There's the fact that you don't have to move from your home, so the emissions are reduced \u2013\u00a0you can explore amazing panoramas that otherwise would require hours and hours of traveling by plane or car.\"\nAs I blinked through tears towards the end of HabitatXR's story about Chestnut the pangolin, some white text floated in front of me before the credits rolled: \"This isn't a story about pangolins. Or ants. Or even climate change. This is a story about us,\" it read \u2013\u00a0a reminder that humans are part of the same ecosystems as plants and other animals.\n\"The overarching message,\" Grech-Cumbo says, \"is that we are a part of nature, not the opposite of nature.\"\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, Xand Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Actor Gene Hackman was alone. \nThe two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals. \nMedical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living. \nIf he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died. \nOfficials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes. \nThe pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window. \nAuthorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.\nTheir remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate. \nBut a police investigation found no foul play. \nInstead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions. \n\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.\nShe noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act. \n\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described. \nThen later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said. \nThough no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.\nAt a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor. \nGiven Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.\nHis autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.\nMs Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe. \n\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.\nDr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.\n\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"\nDr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.\nHe said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.\nThe couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years. \n\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.\nHis partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said. \n\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"\nLaura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers. \n\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained. \nMs Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself. \nJeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.  \n\"It breaks my heart he was alone so long.\" \nA list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.",

Unlike in other parts of the world, the eclipse in the UK will only be partial but still a dramatic spectacle, weather permitting. \nAs the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, it will gradually darken before turning a dusky red, resulting in a stunning \"blood moon\". A weather front will bring some cloud overnight but there is a good chance skies will be clear enough to see it.\nThe last total lunar eclipse in the UK occurred in 2022.\nThe penumbral phase (when the Moon first enters Earth's outer shadow) will begin at 03:57 on Friday.\nThe partial eclipse - when the Moon starts moving into the darker part of Earth's shadow - will begin at 05:09.\nLunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon at the time.\nAt 06:58 the eclipse will reach its true maximum; however, in the UK, the Moon will have already set below the horizon, so we won't be able to see this.\nFor those in North America, most of South America, and western Greenland, the eclipse will be total.\n\"Even if you have to get up super early to see it, I would definitely recommend that you try because seeing it in real life is really, really cool,\" says Imo Bell, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.\nA lunar eclipse happens when Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on the Moon's surface.\nThere are three main types:\nPeople sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a \"blood moon\" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.\nThis is caused by a process known as \"Rayleigh scattering\" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.\nDuring a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.\nTo get the best view of the eclipse, head to a clear, dark location.\n\"My top tip would be to make sure you have a good view of the western horizon, because the Moon will be in the west and it will be setting towards the western horizon,\" advises Imo Bell of the Royal Observatory.\nAnother top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark. \nAlso, of course, check the weather forecast.\n\"Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy.

With a free-scoring France now making the pace at the top of the table, a bonus point would bolster England's - admittedly slim - chances of a title heist.\nMore importantly though, the public required it.\nAfter the strength of the opposition, the situation of the game and the severity of the conditions had variously been blamed for England's inability to deliver running rugby, this was a day that invited ambition and invention.\nEngland's pre-match record against Italy was as pristine as the Twickenham turf, with 31 unanswered wins.\nWhen Ben Earl galloped clear on the final play to add a seventh try, pump the winning margin to 23 points and make it 32 straight successes, it felt like the hosts had lived up to the occasion.\n\"We were trying to play a lot more,\" said Luke Cowan-Dickie after the 47-24 win. \"We got seven tries so something went right.\n\"We tried to attack from anywhere. We knew it was going to be risky, but we want to show the fans that we don't want to kick as much and play with the ball.\"\nWing Ollie Sleightholme, who crossed twice for the hosts, added: \"Us as players decided just to beat people, score more tries and be more aggressive with the ball.\"\nIt was clear. England kicked 31 times, but carried 145 times. Against Scotland last time out, they kicked five times more and carried 67 times fewer.\nA remarkable shift, even allowing for the change in opposition.\nIt isn't a tactic that comes naturally to England's coaching staff, whose Premiership triumph with Leicester in 2022 came via grindingly accurate percentage rugby and a barrage of kicks.\nAnd, even with the near-wholesale adoption of a Northampton backline which won the 2024 domestic crown in more style, England's attack took time to throw off the ring rust.\nA duff pass from Tommy Freeman drew the first groan from the stands inside 30 seconds.

A twin-moment, 10-point swing, that critical passage eased the pressure and allow England to loosen up their style.\nWhen Sleightholme dotted down his second it was via a party game of a passing move, with England's forwards improvising increasingly outlandish offloads. By then the Italy defence had faded.\nThis was still streets behind the otherworldly handling France showed off in Dublin the day before. But it was a definite step up by England.\nThis video can not be played\nGeorge 'thankful' for 'very special day'\nThe pluses are multiple for head coach Steve Borthwick.\nFin Smith, with sharp shooting off the tee, put in another cool-headed performance at fly-half, pulling strings and making plays.\nFraser Dingwall, forced into an unexpected centre combination by Ollie Lawrence's injury, was smart enough to find a way.\nElliot Daly, the other half of that makeshift midfield, worked the angles superbly. The 32-year-old's abilities - grey matter as much as fast twitch - will age slowly and well.\nOllie Chessum, Tom Curry and Earl ranged wide, far and effectively. Ben Curry and Chandler Cunningham-South added energy from the bench.\nJamie George felt the love as the crowd took to their feet to clap him on and off the pitch on his 100th appearance for England. He and his front-row colleagues had the best of the set-piece once more.\nThere will be tougher days and more stringent tests ahead.\nCardiff, on the final day, will probably be one of them.\nWales have stirred themselves under Matt Sherratt. The prospect of wrecking England's title pretensions while dodging the Wooden Spoon will brew up an almighty atmosphere under the Principality roof.\nThe sunlight and support won't be nearly so plentiful next week. There won't be much of either for England in that city-centre cauldron.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump has halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50%, just hours after first threatening them.\nTariffs of 25% still went ahead and took effect on Wednesday.\nThe move by the president comes after the Canadian province of Ontario suspended new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends to some northern states in the US, hours after Trump threatened to sharply increase his tariffs on the country. \nIt marked the latest skirmish in a trade war that risks economic damage to the two North American neighbours. \n\"Cooler heads prevailed,\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told broadcaster CNBC, confirming that Trump would not move forward with his latest tariff threats.\nCanada, one of America's closest trade partners, has borne the brunt of Trump's ire as he has launched trade battles in his first months in office. \nTrump has hit goods from the country, along with Mexico, with a blanket 25% tariff, though he signed orders temporarily exempting a significant number of items from the new duties, which he said were a response to drugs and migrants crossing into the US. \nCanada is also facing 25% tariffs on its steel and aluminium, which are set to go into effect on Wednesday, after Trump said he was ending exemptions to the duties previously granted to some countries. \nCanada has called Trump's attacks unjustified and announced retaliation, including new tariffs on C$30bn ($22bn; \u00a316bn) of US products. \nFord had announced he would tax electricity exports to the US in an effort to get those tariffs removed. \nHe had also previously said he would \"not hesitate to shut off electricity completely\" if the US \"escalates\".\nAnnouncing the decision to suspend the electricity duties, Ford said he thought it was the \"right decision\" to try to focus the discussions on the wider North American free trade deal.\n\"With any negotiation that we have, there's a point that both parties are heated and the temperature needs to come down,\" he said,  thanking Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for contacting him about a meeting.\n\"They understand how serious we are,\" he added. \"We have both agreed, let cooler heads prevail. We need to sit down and move this forward.\"\nIn his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves. \nHe also criticised Canada for relying on the US for \"military protection\", and reiterated that he wanted the country to become the 51st US state.\nHe added that it \"would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear\" if Canada were to join the US as a state.\nThe White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had \"once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people\".\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. \nThe back-and-forth came during a turbulent time for markets.\nThe S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US fell a further 0.7% on Tuesday after dropping 2.7% on Monday, which was its biggest one-day drop since December.\nThe UK's FTSE 100 share index, which had edged lower earlier on Tuesday, fell further following Trump's latest comments and closed down more than 1%. The French Cac 40 index and German Dax followed a similar pattern.\nMonday's stock market sell-off had begun after Trump said the economy was in a \"transition\" when asked about whether the US was heading for a recession.\nInvestors have been concerned about the economic effects of Trump's trade policies, which it is feared could push up inflation in the US and beyond, while uncertainty leads to economic paralyisis.\nEven before Tuesday's comments, Trump's tariffs had already been causing concern for US businesses.\nOn Monday, Jason Goldstein, founder of Icarus Brewing, a small beer-maker in New Jersey that employs 50 people, told the BBC that previous tariff announcements had prompted a slew of emails from his suppliers. \nThey have been warning that price increases for everything from grain and aluminium cans are likely to be coming.\nMr Goldstein has stockpiled an extra month's supply of cans and held off on new purchases as a result of the uncertainty and rapidly changing situation.\n\"It's definitely a worrying time for us,\" he said.\n\"Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.\"",

Frankfurt, Germany's busiest airport, said passengers would be unable to board flights and transfer would \"almost certainly\" be affected.\nVerdi, which represents public sector and transport workers, is in an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions. \nGerman media reports thousands of flights could be cancelled across the day, disrupting travel for more than 500,000 passengers.\nThe Lufthansa group, whose main hub is in Frankfurt, confirmed \"delays and extensive cancellations\" across all its airlines.\nMeanwhile, Munich Airport warned of a \"greatly reduced flight schedule\". This includes flights by Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air.\nKatja Bromm, spokeswoman for Hamburg Airport, where all 143 departures scheduled on Monday have already been cancelled, said Verdi was \"dishonourable\" to call a strike without notice at the start of the holiday season.\nShe said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travellers who have nothing to do with the disputes\".\nA spokesman for Verdi accepted that the strike would affect many, but said the travel disruption was necessary to extracting a better pay offer. \nLars Stubbe, the union's Hamburg representative, told the BBC: \"The workers are aware that disruptions do happen, and they are uncomfortable with that, but in any case, it is the employer that caused these strikes because they haven't put a negotiable offer on the table.\"\nMany of Frankfurt Airport's 1,770 scheduled flights have already been cancelled, while the majority of Munich's 820 flights are expected to be cancelled.\nHundreds more cancellations are anticipated across Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Berlin. \nMany passengers had already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it returned, according to public broadcaster NDR. \nADV, which represents major German airports, said the strike had \"almost completely paralysed air traffic\".\nVerdi's demands include an 8% pay rise, or at least \u20ac350 (\u00a3294) more per month, for all workers - and three extra days of holiday, plus one additional day for union members. \nStubbe said that while airport wages range were above minimum wage, ranging from \u20ac13-\u20ac25 per hour, workers in different roles - particularly security staff - received less annual leave than others.\n\"There have been two rounds of negotiations in which the employers have not yet offered one penny,\" he added. \n\"It is quite usual that we don't get any offers in the first round, but now even in the second round, the employers have basically said, 'No, we're not going to give you an offer because we don't have any money'.\"\nBDLS, the body which sets security workers' pay, said in a statement: \"The damage caused by this strike is almost exclusively to companies that are not at the negotiating table.\"\nIt called on the government to outlaw short-notice strikes, adding that air transport was \"essential for Germany as a business location\" which \"must not be exploited\" in collective pay disputes.\nRalph Beisel, ADV's general manager, said the strike was having an impact on European and global air traffic, leading to missed connections due to a \"domino effect\".\nHe called for reforms to German strike laws concerning \"critical\" infrastructure. \nThe so-called \"warning strike\", an established tactic in German wage negotiations, concerns two separate pay disputes: one relating to airport security workers, and a broader disagreement over pay for federal and municipal government employees.\nVerdi has also called for strikes in waste collection across several German cities, including Berlin, Essen and Kiel, where bins have gone unemptied since last week.\nPay talks for government workers are set to restart on Friday in Potsdam, while the next round of talks for airport security staff is scheduled to begin on 26 March.\nNiklas Benrath, of the VKA, which regulates pay and conditions for municipal workers, also criticised the strikes, saying Verdi's demands would cost nearly \u20ac15bn.\n\"With a total municipal debt of around \u20ac160bn, these demands are not financially viable,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "Alberto Angela has made a career out of exploring his hometown. Here are his favourite spots to unearth Rome's millennia of secrets, from the Vatican Museums to Ostia Antica.\nFrom the 1st-Century BCE ruins of the Imperial Forum to the Trevi Fountain\u2019s Baroque splendour, Rome packs such an overwhelming myriad of postcard-worthy landmarks that digging through its historical layers can make any visitor feel like they've turned into an archaeologist.\nAlberto Angela, a TV presenter, global ambassador for Italian heritage, art, history and culture, and a familiar face in Italian living rooms for nearly four decades knows a thing or two about his hometown's 2,000 years of history \u2013 and he's ready to help visitors discover it, especially as this year's Jubilee newly puts it into the limelight.\nThe SpeciaList\nAlberto Angela is an Italian palaeontologist and TV presenter raised and based in Rome. A well-recognised public scholar, he has published books and conducted documentaries for Italian state broadcaster RAI on science, history and archaeology-related topics for the past 36 years.\n\"Rome has two faces,\" says Angela. \"The Papal \u2013 that of the rich \u2013 and its working-class soul, the one that is closest to us\u2026 the most interesting,\" he says.\nIn a city where grand basilicas lie next to shady alleyways, Angela recommends exploring without cramming in too many sights \u2013 so that one can \"immerse oneself in the world of the ancients\".\nHaving followed in the footsteps of his famous father, Piero Angela \u2013 Italy's most well-known documentarist often called a \"national treasure\" \u2013 the younger Angela attributes his career and love of history to growing up in the Italian capital.\n\"You breathe history here,\" he says. \"Anyone who comes to Rome can see the same afterglow Caesar would have seen. You aren't in a place that doesn't exist anymore. Rome was rebuilt on top of its ancient structures.\"\nFor Angela, this is what makes Rome so unique. \"The city did not cancel its history, unlike many others,\" he says. \"Living here, you understand the ancients.\"\nEmerging from a small market settlement on the Tiber, the city of Rome was at an intersection between the Mediterranean and mainland Europe, making it a crossroads that swelled into the world\u2019s first true metropolis. Angela believes that the city's immense global-reaching political and symbolic impact throughout history means everyone has a \"piece\" of Rome inside them \u2013 which is why it can have such a profound impact on those who visit it.\nHere are Angela's favourite ways to experience ancient history in modern Rome.\nMuch of central Rome's labyrinthine urban grid is a direct heir of the former imperial capital, with public spaces like the Baroque Piazza Navona or Campo de\u2019 Fiori piazza taking their shape from a bygone stadium and theatre, respectively.\nTip:\nTrying to cram in all of Rome's main landmarks in a few days is an Olympian feat, so Angela recommends first-time visitors follow a three-day rule.\n\"See the major sights on the first and second days \u2013 Saint Peter's, the Pantheon, the Colosseum,\" he says. \"And then on the third day, choose yourself, to see something cool [off the beaten path]. When you get home, you'll feel you'll have seen the things everyone talks about, but you'll also have seen something you yourself like.\"\nBut on the Palatine Hill, the mythical birthplace of Rome, you can actually walk on the same stones where emperors Augustus and Nero once dwelled.\n\"It's the place where the Caesars lived and died,\" Angela says.\nAs the legend goes, twin brothers Romulus and Remus received an omen from the gods and decided to lay the foundations of a new city on the Palatine Hill in 753 BCE. In the subsequent centuries, the Palatine developed into an exclusive neighbourhood of patrician villas and Imperial palaces \u2013 indeed, it\u2019s where the word \u201cpalace\u201d takes its root.\nOne of the legendary seven hills of the ancient city, offering an incomparable vantage point with a 360 panorama, Palatine Hill offers what Angela describes as \"a beautiful walk\", with arguably the best views of the Colosseum \u2013 the unmistakable \"star of ancient Rome\".\nVisiting the Palatine is a full immersion into the life of the Roman empire, with a plethora of impressive ruins, including the mosaic floors of Augustus's palace, Domitian's hippodrome and the balcony overlooking the Circus Maximus racecourse.\nWebsite: https://colosseo.it/en/area/the-palatine/\nAddress: Parco archeologico del Colosseo, Via di S. Gregorio 30, 00186\nPhone: + 39 06 21115 843\nInstagram: @parcocolosseo\nAs the centre of Catholicism and one of the most important sites in Christendom, the Unesco-listed Vatican is firmly entrenched among Rome's unmissable sights. In honour of the 2025 Jubilee, tourists and pilgrims alike are flocking to Saint Peter's Basilica to walk through its Holy Door, opened for the occasion every quarter of a century.\nBut while much of the Holy See's architectural majesty is immediately apparent \u2013 from the Michelangelo- and Giacomo della Porta-designed designed dome of Saint Peter's all the way to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums \u2013 some of its greatest treasures are hidden underground.\n\"Once in Saint Peter's, you walk on beautiful marble floorings, you look up to the Baldachin,\" says Angela, renowned for his 2015 TV miniseries Alla Scoperta dei Musei Vaticani (Discovering the Vatican Museums). \"But you can go underground. The Popes' tombs can be found underneath, but under those is the ancient Roman graveyard where Peter the Apostle himself was buried. The foundations of [the Basilica] are a graveyard.\"\nThe Vatican Necropolis, excavated only in the 1940s, features mausoleums belonging to citizens of many faiths, as well as a cluster of tombs called \"Field P\u201d, suspected by some scholars to hold the burial chamber of the Church founder himself.\n\"It's a trip into ancient Rome that you wouldn't expect to find [there]\", Angela says. \"It makes you understand how Rome really is.\"\nVisitors must book visits to the Necropolis on the official website of Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica. The dress code mandates covered shoulders and below-the-knee clothing.\nWebsite: https://www.basilicasanpietro.va/en/san-pietro/the-necropolis\nAddress: Piazza San Pietro, 00120 Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano, Vatican City\nPhone: +39 06 6988 5318\nInstagram: @basilicasanpietro.va\nRome has more than 900 Catholic sites of worship built over the course of the centuries. Now and then, there's one that best encapsulates the city's multi-millennial history, like Angela's pick, the Basilica of San Clemente.\n\"This Basilica conceals the three souls of Rome \u2013 Baroque, medieval and ancient,\" Angela says. \"Anyone who comes across it is enchanted.\"\nTucked behind the Colosseum and a composite of two different churches, San Clemente \u2013 dedicated to the third pope of the same name \u2013 has been a site of worship since ancient Roman times, when it served as a temple for the Zoroastrian cult of Mithras.\nThe temple eventually swelled into its grand current form, featuring an intricate overlay of architectural styles \u2013 from its Renaissance courtyard and the Mannerist facade of the main Basilica, all the way to its underground, early medieval second structure, which hides ancient Roman remnants.\n\"The exterior is beautiful and well-maintained, from the 16th Century, with a Cosmatesque [geometric] marble flooring, and then you take the stairs and arrive at the medieval Basilica,\" says Angela. \"And you find yourself right in ancient Rome, in a Roman temple.\"\nWebsite: https://www.basilicasanclemente.com/eng/\nAddress: Piazza di S. Clemente, 00184\nPhone: +39 06 774 0021\nInstagram: @sanclementeroma\nFrom 17th-Century Villa Borghese to the Capitoline, the city\u2019s oldest art gallery, Rome has no shortage of museums displaying a vast array of artefacts \u2013 matched by equally colossal crowds of spectators.\nWhile Angela certainly recommends visitors enjoy the time-worn classics, he also suggests a quieter, quirkier alternative: the Museo della Comunicazione Scritta dei Romani.\nConveniently located a mere five-minute walk from the Termini train station, the museum is found inside the Baths of Diocletian, where the majestic 4th-Century Imperial termae have survived in remarkable condition. It is also home to a curious collection of esoteric Roman artefacts, showing how the ancients dabbled in the occult.\n\"It's a museum dedicated to how Romans expressed themselves,\" Angela says. \"But there's a part dedicated to magic, voodoo of sorts.\"\nSuperstition was the unspoken crux of ancient Roman life, but one that we often overlook. \"It's a world that often gets left behind, that of spiritual beliefs,\" he adds. \"They found the objects in a parking lot.\"\nAmong the objects on display is a large copper cauldron, curse tablets (defixiones), ritual tools and even Christian spells.\n\"For someone coming from the station, especially if it rains, it's quite an intriguing thing to visit,\" says Angela.\nWebsite: https://museonazionaleromano.beniculturali.it/terme-di-diocleziano/il-museo-della-comunicazione-scritta-dei-romani/\nAddress: Viale Enrico de Nicola 78, 00185\nPhone: +39 06 684 851\nInstagram: @museonazionaleromano\nThe 16th to 18th Centuries were a crucial time for Rome's urban development, as the city's aristocratic families \u2013 including the Farnese, Borghese, Doria and Pamphilj \u2013 vied for social dominance through commissioning lavish building projects, all designed in the Baroque style favoured by the Papal Counter-Reformation.\n\"I'd advise anyone coming to visit Rome to see the palaces of the powerful Roman families,\" says Angela.\nWhile listing a few examples \u2013 Palazzo Colonna and Palazzo Farnese among them \u2013 few rival the opulence of the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome's very own \"Versailles\", in Angela's words.\nThe product of an alliance of noble families, what resulted was a Baroque fantasy come to life and an impressive art collection featuring the works of many of Italy's greats, from Titian to Raphael.\nIts crown jewel is its Hall of Mirrors, commissioned by Gabriele Valvassori in the 1730s and featuring whimsical frescos, gilded Venetian frescos and ornate gold-plated furniture.\n\"I had never been prior to shooting [a TV special] and it's truly spectacular,\" he says. \"It truly surpasses anything else.\"\nWebsite: https://www.doriapamphilj.it/roma/\nAddress: Via del Corso 305, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 679 7323\nInstagram: @galleriadoriapamphilj\nMany visitors coming to Rome don't know that the city has what Angela considers its very own \"Pompeii\" around 32km from the city centre: Ostia Antica.\nOnce Rome's sea port, potentially from as early as the 7th Century BCE, Ostia Antica developed into a bustling seaside suburb, reaching a peak of 75,000 inhabitants in the late Imperial age. While the city declined after the empire\u2019s fall, and the coastline ended up advancing by 3.2km, much of the ancient town that once stood there has been preserved.\n\"You lose yourself there, you can see everything,\" Angela says. \"Bakeries, public bathrooms (latrines), homes, apartment blocks\u2026 street businesses, not too dissimilar to those of today.\"\nA tour of Ostia Antica can show you much of the amenities and features of ancient Roman life \u2013 from its 1st-Century BCE theatre, to its forum, public baths and necropolis.\nFor Angela, Ostia Antica best preserves the \"popolare\" (working-class) soul of ancient Rome \u2013 one which its newer counterpart, the beach suburb Lido di Ostia, has carried on in modern form.\nOstia Antica is a roughly 30-minute drive from central Rome, and can be reached in around the same time by taking the Metromare commuter rail from the Porta S Paolo station.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Some of those internal messages are repeated by players in interviews, but without context as to why Brendon is saying them - things like 'we don't care about winning' - that is nonsense. \n\"Sometimes you have got to be above the players and you have got to drag them up, and sometimes when things are going well you've got to be below them and bring them down - and that does happen, too.\" \nComments which caused a stir include Ben Duckett saying it did not matter that England lost 3-0 to India as long as they went on to win the Champions Trophy, while in September last year Harry Brook said \"if you get caught somewhere on the boundary, then who cares?\" when asked about his side's batting approach.\nBut Key added that McCullum is a \"master\" at knowing the differences between his players, such as who needs a harder approach and who thrives by being more relaxed.\n\"After the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston, an absolute rollercoaster, Brendon said something along the lines of how those close games feel like ones you've won,\" Key added.\n\"So that's why it is annoying when it is taken out of context. What he's trying to do is lift everyone, he's trying to make sure they don't walk out feeling like the world has ended because they are gutted, but they still have four Tests left to play.\"\nTest Match Special podcast: Rob Key\nStokes considered as England white-ball captain\n'Karachi a familiar low - England's rebuild starts here'\nKey also denied suggestions he and the England management had put too much focus on Test cricket which resulted in poor results from the white-ball side. \nHe said that during Joe Root's tenure as Test captain, he was often playing without his full-strength XI but this winter the selection decisions were inevitable.\n\"The white-ball team [when I started] were the best or one of the best in the world, and they had done a lot of work with an era of cricketers who were very established and experienced and knew exactly what they were doing,\" said Key.\n\"The problem that we found this winter is that we had a decision to make - and it wasn't a matter of choosing between white and red ball - it was more the fact that it is almost impossible to have your best team play in both formats now.\" \nEngland played three Tests in Pakistan in October, a white-ball series in the Caribbean started a day after that series ended and then three further Tests in New Zealand followed. \nKey said he would have made the same selections again because of the complexity of the schedule.\n\"It meant that the white-ball team suffered, but there was almost no choice,\" he said. \n\"It was either one or the other. Every step along the way we've had to make a call of 'you can only have your best team at one of these series'.\" \nKey's next significant decision will be to appoint Jos Buttler's successor as white-ball captain after he stood down at the end of the Champions Trophy. The process will take time and Key said he has not had any conversations with current Test skipper Stokes about the vacancy. \nEngland next play a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May, followed by a white-ball series against West Indies.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University. \nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nIn his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \n\nCarney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nHe is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nHis political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",

His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out. \nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles. \nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football. \nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of \u00a350m, potentially rising to \u00a355 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club. \nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\n\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 24 goals and 18 assists in 39 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football. \nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training. It is this discipline that has been key to raising him to his physical and mental peak.\nAnd now he has reached this point, there is no stopping him and if Barcelona go far in the Champions League, nobody should argue his right to be considered one of the top players in the world.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Head in hands, eight-year-old Timmy muttered to himself as he tried to beat a robot powered by artificial intelligence at a game of chess.\nBut this was not an AI showroom or laboratory \u2013 this robot was living on a coffee table in a Beijing apartment, along with Timmy.\nThe first night it came home, Timmy hugged his little robot friend before heading to bed. He doesn't have a name for it \u2013 yet.\n\"It's like a little teacher or a little friend,\" the boy said, as he showed his mum the next move he was considering on the chess board.\nMoments later, the robot chimed in: \"Congrats! You win.\" Round eyes blinking on the screen, it began rearranging the pieces to start a new game as it continued in Mandarin: \"I've seen your ability, I will do better next time.\"\nChina is embracing AI in its bid to become a tech superpower by 2030.\nDeepSeek, the breakthrough Chinese chatbot that caught the world's attention in January, was just the first hint of that ambition. \nMoney is pouring into AI businesses seeking more capital, fuelling domestic competition. There are more than 4,500 firms developing and selling AI, schools in the capital Beijing are introducing AI courses for primary and secondary students later this year, and universities have increased the number of places available for students studying AI. \n\"This is an inevitable trend. We will co-exist with AI,\" said Timmy's mum, Yan Xue. \"Children should get to know it as early as possible. We should not reject it.\"\nShe is keen for her son to learn both chess and the strategy board game Go \u2013 the robot does both, which persuaded her that its $800 price tag was a good investment. Its creators are already planning to add a language tutoring programme.\nPerhaps this was what the Chinese Communist Party hoped for when it declared in 2017 that AI would be \"the main driving force\" of the country's progress. President Xi Jinping is now betting big on it, as a slowing Chinese economy grapples with the blow of tariffs from its biggest trading partner, the United States.\nBeijing plans to invest 10tn Chinese yuan ($1.4tn; \u00a31tn) in the next 15 years as it competes with Washington to gain the edge in advanced tech. AI funding got yet another boost at the government's annual political gathering, which is currently under way. This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.\nBut DeepSeek has shown that Chinese companies can overcome these barriers. And that's what has stunned Silicon Valley and industry experts \u2013 they did not expect China to catch up so soon.\nIt's a reaction Tommy Tang has become accustomed to after six months of marketing his firm's chess-playing robot at various competitions.\nTimmy's machine comes from the same company, SenseRobot, which offers a wide range in abilities \u2013 Chinese state media hailed an advanced version in 2022 that beat chess Grand Masters at the game.\n\"Parents will ask about the price, then they will ask where I am from. They expect me to come from the US or Europe. They seem surprised that I am from China,\" Mr Tang said, smiling. \"There will always be one or two seconds of silence when I say I am from China.\"\nHis firm has sold more than 100,000 of the robots and now has a contract with a major US supermarket chain, Costco.\nOne of the secrets to China's engineering success is its young people. In 2020, more than 3.5 million of the country's students graduated with degrees in science, technology, engineering and maths, better known as STEM.\nThat's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. \"Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,\" Xi told party leaders last week.\nEver since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has \"been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,\" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. \"In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.\"\nBehind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.\nThe company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.\n\"Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,\" Mr Lyu insists.\nThe success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and \"is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,\" he added.\n\"It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.\"\nSix homegrown AI firms, including DeepSeek, have now been nicknamed China's six little dragons by the internet \u2013 the others are Unitree Robotics, Deep Robotics, BrainCo, Game Science, and Manycore Tech.\nSome of them were at a recent AI fair in Shanghai, where the biggest Chinese firms in the business showed off their advances, from search and rescue robots to a backflipping dog-like one, which wandered the halls among visitors.\nIn one bustling exhibition hall, two teams of humanoid robots battled it out in a game of football, complete in red and blue jerseys. The machines fell when they clashed \u2013 and one of them was even taken off the field in a stretcher by their human handler who was keen to keep the joke going.\nIt was hard to miss the air of excitement among developers in the wake of DeepSeek. \"Deepseek means the world knows we are here,\" said Yu Jingji, a 26-year-old engineer.\nBut as the world learns of China's AI potential, there are also concerns about what AI is allowing the Chinese government to learn about its users.\nAI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.\nThe West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.\nBut Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.\nThat same fear \u2013 where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea banned new downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia have barred the app from government-issued devices.\nChinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that \"privacy was a red line\" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.\n\"DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,\" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that \"the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain\".\nBut China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage \u2013 because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.\nSo the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.\nSo, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.\n\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"\nThis could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.\nXi has repeatedly declared \"technological self-reliance\" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.\nThe Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race \u2013 the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for \"AI triumphalism\" because China was still in \"catch-up mode\".\nPresident Xi is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, robots and advanced tech in preparation for a marathon that he hopes China will eventually win.",

        "article_text": "The US Department of Education is planning to cut about half of its workforce, as the Trump administration works to slash the size of the federal government.\nThe mass layoffs will affect nearly 2,100 people who are set to be placed on leave from 21 March.\nTrump has long sought to eliminate the department, a long-cherished goal of some conservatives, but such an action would require approval by Congress. \nThe department, which has an annual budget of around $238bn (\u00a3188bn), employs more than 4,000 people.\nEstablished in 1979, the department oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students.\nBut Trump has accused the agency of \"indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material\".\nA common misconception is that the department operates US schools and sets curricula - that is done by states and local districts.\nAnd a relatively small percentage of funding for primary and secondary schools  - about 13% - comes from federal funds. The majority is made up from states and local groups.\nThe agency also plays a prominent role in administering and overseeing the federal student loans used by millions of Americans to pay for higher education.\n\"As part of the Department of Education's final mission, the department today initiated a reduction in force impacting nearly 50% of the department's workforce,\" a statement from Education Secretary Linda McMahon said on Tuesday.\nShe said the cuts would impact all divisions in the department and were made to \"better serve students, parents, educators, and taxpayers\". \nThe agency had 4,133 employees when Trump was sworn into office, an announcement from the department states. It has the smallest staff of all the 15 US cabinet-level agencies.\nAfter the cuts, 2,183 people would remain, which included several hundred who retired or accepted a buyout programme earlier this year, the agency said. \nThe notice to employees said that all of those who are laid off would continue to receive their normal pay and benefits until 9 June, as well as a severance package or retirement pay based on how long they'd worked at the department.\n\"The Department of Education will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking,\" the email states.\nReports have suggested that Trump, for weeks, has considered signing an executive order impacting the Department of Education, though he has not yet done so.\nSeveral of his executive orders have been met with lawsuits, as have Trump's dramatic cuts at agencies around Washington. \nSeveral lawsuits have also challenged actions by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), a team aiming to slash government spending that's being led by Elon Musk. The agency has installed deputies at various agencies, slashed staff and accessed data across the government. \nFor decades, Republicans have floated the idea of axing the Education Department.

        "article_text": "Australian Grand Prix\nVenue: Albert Park, Melbourne Dates: 14 March-16 March Race start: 04:00 GMT on Sunday, 16 March\nCoverage: Live radio commentary of practice and qualifying on BBC 5 Sports Extra, race live on BBC Radio 5 Live. Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nAfter a three-month break, the 2025 Formula 1 season is almost upon us. \nThe Australian Grand Prix this weekend is the first of 24 races between now and Abu Dhabi in December.\nThere are plenty of talking points with Lewis Hamilton preparing for his Ferrari debut, Max Verstappen chasing a fifth consecutive drivers' title and McLaren hoping to maintain the pace that brought them the constructors' championship in 2024.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions before the season gets under way in Melbourne.\nWhat is the pragmatic expectation at Ferrari this year? Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc have all failed to win them a championship so far. Is too much expected from Lewis Hamilton? \u2013 Kenneth\nHamilton has been clear - he is going to Ferrari to win an eighth world title.\nWhen a driver of that level goes to such a storied team, it's obvious what the target is. So, questions about whether too much is expected of him miss the point - he and Ferrari expect that of themselves.\nThe impact of such an achievement would be massive.\nHamilton's move to Ferrari has already dramatically increased interest in F1 in the run-up to this season. Imagine what the reaction would be to the sport's most celebrated driver breaking the only remaining all-time record while driving for its most iconic team.\nWill he do it? That depends on two things. Whether the Ferrari car is up to it, and whether Hamilton can beat his team-mate, Charles Leclerc.\nAs for comparisons with Alonso and Vettel, neither managed to win the title they and Ferrari so craved.\nAlonso was plain unlucky - he should have won in 2010 and 2012. He was outstanding in both years, especially in 2012.\nHad it not been for a catastrophic strategy decision in Abu Dhabi in 2010, and two separate assaults from two different Lotus drivers at the start of two different grands prix in 2012, he would have been champion.\nVettel's situation was more complex - arguably he and Ferrari threw away chances in both 2017 and 2018 through a combination of driver errors and team fallibility. Many people believe Alonso would have won at least one of those titles had he stayed at Ferrari.\nBut that was then. The belief is that this is about as good a time as Hamilton could go to Ferrari. \nIn Frederic Vasseur, they have a team boss who has given the team a more international outlook, and is very matter-of-fact and focused on practicality. He seems to be having a good effect and moving them in the right direction.\nNo one knows what will happen. But it is sure is going to be entertaining finding out, however it ends.\nThis video can not be played\n'Arriving in red will be cool' - Hamilton's Melbourne excitment\nWhat would success look like? Key questions for Hamilton at Ferrari\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nIs this a critical season for George Russell, especially given the possibility that Max Verstappen might leave Red Bull in the future? - David\nEvery season is critical in F1 - people are always looking for signs of weakness. But the stakes are quite high for Russell this year, and that's almost independent of Max Verstappen.\nRussell is out of contract at the end of the year, and his new team-mate is an 18-year-old rookie, Andrea Kimi Antonelli. From the point of view of his reputation within the sport, Russell has to come out on top.\nIf he doesn't, though, that does not necessarily mean his Mercedes career is over. But it would mean Antonelli had marked himself out as a potential future great.\nIf Verstappen is not available, Toto Wolff will stick with his current driver line-up into 2026 - Russell has come out of three seasons with Lewis Hamilton and just about won bragging rights. He has earned his status as one of F1's very top drivers.\nThe pressure is also on Antonelli, even though his raw talent is believed to be immense. If he is comfortably beaten by Russell, he won't be around long. Such is the way of things in F1.\nIt's a tough world, and only the strongest survive.\nComparing the apparently friendly relationship between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris with the ongoing fallout of the Verstappen-Russell spat, does that show that Verstappen doesn't really fear Norris, but he does fear Russell? \u2013 Joe\nIf you asked that question to Max Verstappen himself, I know exactly what he would say. He fears no one.\nVerstappen is absolutely confident that if he is given a car in which it is possible to win the title, he will win it. Doesn't matter who the opponent is.\nHow he gets on with someone out of the car has no bearing whatsoever on his behaviour in it - you only have to look at last year's Mexico City Grand Prix and his two penalised incidents with Norris to see that.\nHe is as ruthless as they come, and anyone who gets in his way will get the same treatment.\nHow they respond to him off the track is a different question. But Verstappen doesn't care about that either. Friendly, or not. Makes no difference to him. He'll race them just has hard.\nThis video can not be played\nRussell won't 'bow down' to Verstappen\nDo you think the conflict between F1 and the FIA might escalate? Where will it lead?  - Sam\nThere has been for some time widespread concern within Formula 1 about the actions of Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of governing body the FIA, and nothing over the winter has changed that.\nBen Sulayem has been embroiled in a series of controversies since he took office in December 2021, and his recent actions in changing the FIA's internal rules to reduce accountability, and codifying a method by which drivers can be banned for swearing have just added to a long list of actions perceived to be problematic by many within the sport.\nAt the moment, though, there is no open conflict between F1 and the FIA, nor between the teams and the FIA.\nHowever, everyone in the sport is very aware of the growing disquiet within the FIA itself - the latest facet of which was revealed by BBC Sport last week in its report on a number of world motorsport council members being barred from its latest meeting, a dispute that could yet see further legal action.\nWith an FIA presidential election looming at the end of the year, the sport's bosses are keeping a close eye on events. But unless Ben Sulayem does something that directly affects F1 business, it is unlikely F1 itself will take any action.\nBut with the drivers unhappy, and the FIA facing a lawsuit from Susie Wolff, and who knows what else coming down the line, this story is not going anywhere any time soon.\nAfter a first-lap red flag, Charles Leclerc managed his tyres to win his home race for the first time in 2024\nAs the FIA has now introduced an extra mandatory pit stop for Monaco, do you think that introducing this across all the grand prix would improve the racing as there would be less tyre saving? \u2013 Andrew\nThe idea of introducing an extra pit stop into the Monaco Grand Prix has been given a guardedly warm response so far.\nThe hope is that this will add extra excitement to the race and reduce its tendency to become a procession.\nLewis Hamilton said he believed it was his idea originally, and added: \"Monaco has to be at least a two-stop. The one-stop was never really great. \n\"That (two stops) won't fix it all. We'll still see some of the issues of not overtaking and stuff, but I think it will make it more exciting.\"\nSome, though, have wondered whether this was a reaction to a particularly bad event last year, which was itself caused by a specific set of circumstances.\nLast year, there was a first-lap crash that led to a red flag. So all the front-runners fitted a set of tyres to get them to the end of the race, and planned not to stop again. That led to Charles Leclerc leading the race at a pedestrian pace and nothing happening.\nBut it's not like that every year. Regardless of the difficulty in overtaking, Monaco has seen a series of interesting races in recent years, some influenced by weather, and others by problems experienced by one driver or another.\nThe mandatory two-stop has been arrived at as a necessary evil - introducing an element of artificiality to ameliorate a specific problem.\nIn general, introducing that level of gimmickry is not something on which the powers that be in F1 are keen.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat is at stake at under-pressure Red Bull?\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "article_text": "Parents who don't want their children on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.\nThe site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.\nBut its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.\nWhen asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"\n\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.\nUS-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.\nIn the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\nBut Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nPlayers who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.\nHowever, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.\nWhile the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.\nWhen we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.\n\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.\nHe admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.\nWe also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:\nWhen we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.\n\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.\nHe insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.\nMr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.\nMr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.\n\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.\nThe name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.\nMr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.\nHe says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.\n\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.\nBut despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.\nPlayers buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.\nMr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.\nRobux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).\nIts share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.\nMr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.\nHe describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.\nThey have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.\nAsked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"\nWe finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.\nWe use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.\nAdditional reporting by Ammie Sekhon",

        "article_text": "On his 18th birthday, Raphinha sat alone in his tiny room in Florianopolis, staring at his phone. No messages. No calls. No offers. Injured and out of the Avai U20 team, he was on the verge of giving up. \nFootball had been his escape from the favelas of Brazil's Porto Alegre, but now it felt like a dead end. His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nHe again showed his worth in Tuesday's last-16 second leg against Benfica, scoring twice to help send Barca through to the quarter-finals.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out. \nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles. \nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football. \nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of \u00a350m, potentially rising to \u00a355 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club. \nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\n\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 26 goals and 19 assists in 40 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal, who also played a starring role in Tuesday's win over Benfica, has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football. \nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training. It is this discipline that has been key to raising him to his physical and mental peak.\nAnd now he has reached this point, there is no stopping him and if Barcelona go far in the Champions League, nobody should argue his right to be considered one of the top players in the world.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump.\nThe former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. \nIn much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"  \nCarney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nCarney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. \nThe Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. \nCarney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.\nLoud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital.  \nThe party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. \nCarney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\nThe governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country\nAt the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.\nThey have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.\nMuch of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. \nThe US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy.\nCarney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was \"attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses\". \n\"We can't let him succeed,\" he added, as the crowd booed loudly.\nHe said his government would keep tariffs on US imports \"until the Americans show us respect\".\nCanada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed.\n\"I know these are dark days,\" Carney said. \"Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. \n\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\nCarney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.\nThe US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.\n\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney. \n\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"\nShortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.\nHe warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.\nThe Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".\nThey accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.\nPoilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. \nCarney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December.\nFederal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he \"embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues\". \n\"I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election.\" \nThe Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. \nThe former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left.\nA major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years.\nHe has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US.\nDuring the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",

        "article_text": "It has been five months since Jonas Eidevall unexpectedly decided to walk away from his position as Arsenal manager.\nNow the 42-year-old is looking forward to a new chapter in the United States as head coach of NWSL side San Diego Wave, with the season getting under way this weekend.\nEidevall tells BBC Sport about the reasons behind his Arsenal exit, why he has no regrets over letting record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema leave and the challenge facing him in the NWSL.\n'Shock' at Eidevall resignation but not his exit\nEidevall criticises 'amateurish behaviour' with fixture schedule\nDuring the Swede's three years at Arsenal he guided them to three consecutive top-three finishes but the closest they came to unseating Chelsea as Women's Super League champions came in his first campaign when they ended a point adrift of the Blues.\nHe claimed the club's first trophy in four years when they won the League Cup in 2023, and they retained it the following year, but further silverware eluded him.\nHis final game came against the side which had proved his biggest nemesis, Chelsea, as he oversaw a 2-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium in front of increasingly disillusioned supporters.\n\"I thought the easiest quick fix in this moment here now is for me to step away,\" he says.\n\"It was extremely tough, both for me personally - my family of course - but also professionally. It's a privilege to be leading a club like Arsenal.\n\"It's very special when you're there, so an extremely difficult decision to make.\"\nThe departure of striker Miedema, who scored 125 goals and provided 50 assists in 172 appearances, to Manchester City during the summer had piled the pressure on Eidevall before the season had even begun.\nHe has previously spoken to Sky Sports, external about how he \"lost quite a lot of my relationship with the supporters\" when he decided not to renew Miedema's contract, so does he have any regrets?\n\"I don't. I think you always take the best decisions as you can make for the club at that point with the information that you know,\" he says.\n\"You can't rethink decisions based on new information that you could not have known at that time. That's not a helpful way of thinking about life. So no regrets. \n\"I do think that that decision was a big part in my relationship with the supporters [deteriorating].\n\"I never took any decision to be liked. I always took decisions because I felt they were the best for the club and for the team,\" adds Eidevall, who signed Spain World Cup winner Mariona Caldentey as a replacement.\n\"But the problem is when you take those decisions and you don't get the results then of course it very much spirals.\"\nStrong results did not materialise.\nThe north London club were sixth in the WSL after winning just one of their opening four games, while they suffered a demoralising 5-2 defeat at Bayern Munich in the Champions League three days before that defeat at home to Chelsea, where some fans could be seen clamouring for his sacking by waving P45 signs.\nSo, on the Monday after that match, Eidevall informed the club of his intention to step down.\nAsked whether the club were surprised, he says: \"Yeah I think so.\"\nYet it ended up being a quick process, explains Eidevall, who had not told the club he wanted to leave the next day, but that's when his departure was announced.\n\"They were onboard with that decision [to leave], which very much told me that if the club is onboard with that decision it's 100% the right decision to walk away,\" he adds.\n\"So that gave me that little bit extra sense of clarity in where we were at.\"\nWith time to reflect on his departure, he looks back on his spell in north London fondly, focusing on the \"immense growth\" the team went through off the pitch.\n\"Both my mission - and also the club's - was to make sure that Arsenal was back to the top of the women's game,\" he says.\n\"I think you can argue on a lot of levels right now Arsenal are that, with having the Emirates as the main home, having really, really good attendances both home and away, having much-improved facilities and staffing around the team, and having a team that has a better mix of youth and more experienced players.\n\"That part is really good, and I can see my part that I played in that.\"\nOn the pitch, he says that \"you can argue quite fairly\" that Arsenal were the second-best team in the UK behind Chelsea during his time as manager, if you take all the competitions into account.\n\"When you see the resources - with player salaries and other costs around the team - Chelsea are by far the biggest spender and it reasonable that they are also the best team,\" Eidevall says.\n\"To be above [Manchester] City and below Chelsea is probably a reasonable result to get from what was invested.\n\"Would I have liked to get a league title? Yes, very much. Then I would have been very, very happy with the results.\"\nEidevall was announced as the new San Diego Wave head coach in January, becoming the permanent replacement for former England captain Casey Stoney, who was sacked in June.\nHe says after leaving Arsenal \"there was quite a bit of interest immediately from various club teams and national teams\" and he spoke to a few different clubs, including San Diego.\nThe \"long-term vision\" at the Californian club really appealed to him, as well as the \"competitiveness\" of the NWSL itself.\nHowever, Eidevall is joining a league undergoing big changes,, external with this year the first time there will be no annual draft - making it the first major US professional sports league to abolish the draft system and aligning the competition closer to other women's football leagues around the world.\nHis club are also going through a period of transition having lost two of their biggest names - Naomi Girma to Chelsea and Alex Morgan to retirement - and they navigated the second-half of the season without a permanent coach.\nHe describes Girma as an \"irreplaceable player\" but says the defender was \"set on leaving\" before his arrival.\nYet despite the huge turnover of players at the club, he says the team's goal should still be \"to reach the play-offs\" at the end of the season.\n\"It feels like a complete rebuild to be honest,\" he says. \"That's the challenge but also the opportunity.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Arriving in red will be cool' - Hamilton's Melbourne excitment\nLewis Hamilton's move to Ferrari is the single biggest storyline of the 2025 Formula 1 season.\nThe sport's biggest star - the only driver who truly transcends the sport - has joined its most iconic team, and interest in how their partnership develops is stratospheric.\nThese are the key questions as Hamilton begins his new adventure.\nHamilton signed with Ferrari in January 2024, just over six months after sealing a new contract with Mercedes.\nIt was the talks over that new Mercedes deal that led to the Ferrari move.\nMercedes wanted to offer Hamilton only a one-year contract - team boss Toto Wolff was planning for the future. The seven-time world champion knew he wanted to stay in F1 longer.\nThey compromised on what is known as a \"one-plus-one\" contract - a firm deal for 2024 with an option for 2025.\nBut Mercedes' reticence to commit to him led Hamilton to consider his future. He had always had a hankering after driving for Ferrari and he has a close relationship with their team boss Frederic Vasseur, which dates back 20 years to their time in the junior categories together.\nHamilton's single biggest ambition is to win the record eighth title of which he feels he was robbed by race director Michael Masi making up the rules and mishandling a late safety-car period in the 2021 title decider in Abu Dhabi.\nMercedes had not furnished him with a car in which he could do that since, so he had plenty of doubts on that front, too.\nHamilton approached Ferrari and the team were keen to do a deal. So when they offered him a longer contract - at least to the end of 2026 - and a close to 50% pay rise to a reputed salary of 65m euros (\u00a355m), it was a no-brainer.\nThe fact that Ferrari had finished 2023 in stronger shape than Mercedes made the decision even easier.\nIn 2024, Hamilton was comprehensively out-qualified by a team-mate for the first time in his career, ending the season 19-5 down to George Russell in their one-lap head-to-head, at an average deficit of 0.171 seconds.\nAlthough both won two races, Hamilton finished 22 points adrift in the championship.\nIt was a confusing situation, because in 2022 and 2023, the two had been closely matched in qualifying, and one of them finished ahead in the championship one year and the other the other.\nThe bottom line is that Hamilton struggled with the characteristics of the 2024 Mercedes more than Russell.\nThe car had slow-corner understeer. The way to counteract this was to slide the rear on entry to promote turn-in. But doing that generates rear tyre temperature, which reduces grip, a problem that increases over time. Hamilton was less able to deal with this than Russell.\nOn top of this, there is no question that, frustrated by his qualifying deficit, Hamilton would sometimes push too hard when it mattered right at the end of qualifying. That led to mistakes, which further harmed his performance.\nThe Mercedes engineers felt that there was something about the general characteristics of the current generation of cars and their ground-effect design philosophy that does not marry as well with Hamilton's style as the previous generations of cars.\nBut just because that was the case last year does not mean it will be the same this year at Ferrari. It may depend on how the car behaves.\nEqually, it's impossible to know how much of an effect psychology had - Hamilton had to do a whole year with Mercedes, the longest season in history, knowing he was leaving at the end of the season, and with his heart effectively already elsewhere.\nCertainly Vasseur believes that is too important to ignore. And Hamilton is of the same opinion.\nHamilton turned 40 in January and is the second oldest driver in F1.\nOf course, athletic performance declines over time, but Fernando Alonso - who is three and a half years older than Hamilton - insists his age is not a problem, and there is no evidence in his case that it is.\nAlonso is still performing at an extremely high level, and produced some outstanding drives last year - as he did in 2023, when again he was older than Hamilton is now.\nThere is no evidence or reason to suggest Hamilton's age will have a deleterious effect on him.\nLewis Hamilton was sixth fastest on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain at the end of February\nHamilton does not speak Italian. He is trying to learn, but it is unlikely the fact he cannot speak the language will have a serious effect on him.\nFor a start, all technical debriefs in Ferrari are conducted in English. Vasseur also does not speak Italian.\nMichael Schumacher could not speak Italian - and he won five world titles with Ferrari and is their most successful driver. Neither could Nigel Mansell. He won on his debut with Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix. He became a folk hero in his two years with the team and is still idolised as 'Il Leone' (the Lion) now.\nVasseur says: \"You know that 99% of the job is in English. It's good to speak a little bit of Italian for the mechanics and the relationship in the team but I am not sure it is crucial for the performance.\"\nCharles Leclerc finished third in the 2024 drivers' championship on 356 points. Hamiton was seventh with 223\nHamilton's partner/rival in the other Ferrari is Charles Leclerc, a 27-year-old from Monaco who has won eight grands prix and set 26 pole positions since joining the team in 2019.\nLeclerc is a Ferrari protege - he has been nurtured by the team since he was a teenager. He is richly talented and regarded as possibly the fastest driver over one lap in F1 at the moment, and his career statistics back that up.\nLeclerc does not have such a big offset between his qualifying and race success stats because he is bad at racing. He has it because his ability and raw speed has often meant he has qualified the car higher than its competitive level can sustain over a race distance.\nHamilton is also a brilliant qualifier - he holds the all-time record for pole positions. And in many ways the two drivers are very similar. Both of them have an ability to produce 'wow' performances in qualifying - laps that leave people open-mouthed, thinking, 'where did that come from?'\nHamilton might have to accept that there is a strong chance he will be out-qualified by Leclerc over the season. But he will be confident that what he probably considers his greater race-craft and experience will see him through over a season.\nHe says: \"Charles is very professional, very embedded in this team. He is very fast and I am completely aware of that. You have seen his qualifying laps.\n\"I told him in Bahrain many years ago (in 2019) he had a bright future ahead of him.  It is not going to be easy to beat him. Especially in his home. But we will work together and have some great races, I hope.\"\nHamilton cannot control whether Ferrari build him a competitive car. And if they don't, the minimum that could be considered success would be to come out on top against Leclerc.\nBut Hamilton has not gone to Ferrari to score a few podium finishes. He wants an eighth world title. He's confident he and the team can do it. And given his level of career success, and Ferrari's history in F1, nothing less than a championship will suffice.\nHe says: \"This team already has an insane legacy and are not short of championships they have won. They have a winning mentality in their DNA.\n\"The competition is fierce. It is going to be close. but I have a great team-mate, the energy I have seen from the team, there is magic here.\n\"It is going to take a lot of hard work and everyone is putting that in. But it is also about belief. Everyone in this team dreams of winning with Ferrari.\n\"I have worked with two title-winning teams before,  I know what one looks and feels like. The passion is like nothing you have ever seen. They have got everything they need to win a championship. It is just about putting the pieces together.\"\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat is at stake at under-pressure Red Bull?\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

He had always had a hankering after driving for Ferrari and he has a close relationship with their team boss Frederic Vasseur, which dates back 20 years to their time in the junior categories together.Hamilton's single biggest ambition is to win the record eighth title of which he feels he was robbed by race director Michael Masi making up the rules and mishandling a late safety-car period in the 2021 title decider in Abu Dhabi.Mercedes had not furnished him with a car in which he could do that since, so he had plenty of doubts on that front, too.Hamilton approached Ferrari and the team were keen to do a deal. Everyone in this team dreams of winning with Ferrari.",

Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 March\nWhile negotiations aimed at reunifying men's golf grind to a halt, the PGA Tour is taking steps to speed up play.\nCommissioner Jay Monahan's state of the union news conference, before this week's Players Championship here at Sawgrass, made clear that eradicating slow play has become more of a priority than ever before for a circuit that has always indulged slowcoaches.\nBut this, the tour's marquee tournament, will again be played in the shadow of the ongoing split brought about by the arrival in 2022 of the breakaway LIV tour.\nThis year's Players will play out in the absence of the reigning US Open champion.  Last year the Masters winner was missing and in 2023 there was no title defence.\nThis, of course, is because Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith all play on LIV.\nTheir absence from the PGA Tour is felt more keenly this week than any other. The old debate as to whether the Players is the 'fifth' major is no longer relevant and will not be until the game reunifies.\nHere we have the most stark imperative for a deal to be done with LIV's Saudi backers.\nAn agreement, though, is not imminent. \nMonahan reiterated that no follow-up meetings are in the diary after the recent White House gathering with the Saudi Public Investment Fund's governor Yasir Al Rumayyan ended without settlement.\n\"We appreciate Yasir's innovative vision,\" Monahan said. \"And we can see a future where we welcome him on to our board and work together to move the global game forward.\n\"As part of our negotiations, we believe there's room to integrate important aspects of LIV Golf into the PGA Tour platform. We're doing everything that we can to bring the two sides together.\"\nMonahan added that while his organisation has \"removed some hurdles, others remain\". \nIn other words, something has to give to end the stalemate.\n'Hurdles' in PGA-LIV deal - but Trump 'bolstering' talks\nAnd no matter how hard the golf media tried, the commissioner flat-batted every enquiry as to how that might be achieved.  \nMonahan does not play verbal 'Bazball'; every non-answer dictated by the delicate nature of golf's future.\nWhere he was more forthcoming, was an acceptance - at long last - that men's professional golf has a problem with slow play.  It seems steps are being taken where the biggest offenders will start to be named and shamed.\n\"We've committed to addressing the speed of play,\" Monahan said as he announced working group recommendations that will be implemented to try to erase one of the sport's biggest blights.\n\"We will begin publishing speed-of-play-related statistics later this season,\" he added.  From 14 April testing will begin on the PGA Tour's feeder circuits to impose stroke penalties on the slowest golfers.\nMonahan also confirmed that the use of range finders will be allowed at tournaments between next month's Masters and the US PGA Championship in May to see whether this improves round times.\n\"We're listening to our fans and we're responding, and clearly this is something where they would like to see improvement,\" the commissioner said.\n\"I think there's a real commitment from players across the board to make certain that we're doing everything that we possibly can to improve, and these three steps are just a start.\"\nThis is a marked shift from an organisation that for decades insisted that slow play was not a problem. The rival LIV circuit has imposed stroke penalties on slowcoaches and now the PGA Tour is starting to respond.\n\"I look at this as a very positive development,\" Monahan insisted.\n\"I think it's pretty telling that when you've got six player directors that sit on our boards, and you've got 16 members of our Player Advisory Council, that there's a lot of shaking of heads and there's an understanding that this is an area where we need to improve.\"\nTwo-time major winner Collin Morikawa says publishing data that shows which players are quicker than others, thereby identifying the slowest, is a good idea. \n\"I don't know why you wouldn't want it to be released,\" said the 2021 Open winner.\n\"You just have to start giving guys actual penalties, whether it be strokes or FedExCup (point deductions). What I've learned is that monetary fines are useless.\"\nMorikawa added:  \"What is there to hide, right? If you're slow, you know you're slow. I mean, if you don't know, then there's an issue.\n\"To me, there's no issue with letting it out. It's only going to make things better because then you're either going to have a target on you, put a little more pressure and hopefully you pick it up, or you get penalised. It's very simple.\"\nDouble US PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas agrees that publicly revealing which players are the slowest will have a beneficial effect. \n\"Nobody wants to be known as that,\" said the US Ryder Cup star.\n\"I'm the first to admit I'm on the slow side of players. It bothers me, but I've talked to many officials about it, like I want to know why I'm slow because obviously the first thing that any slower player thinks is that they're not slow.\"\nFans will surely welcome such long-awaited initiatives to improve pace of play on the game's biggest tour.\nBut those awaiting some kind of resolution that brings the game back together are still left playing the waiting game.",

Other major tech stocks including Meta, Amazon and Alphabet also fell sharply.\nHowever, there was little sign of the turbulence spilling into Europe as the FTSE 100 index, which tracks the biggest companies listed in the UK, and the German Dax both opened flat on Tuesday.

The three countries have rejected the accusations.\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian said investors were initially optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war.\nHe said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets.\n\"It's a complete change in what the market expected,\" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending due to uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth.\nBut Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to President Trump, has pushed back against those projecting this bleak outlook. \nIn an interview with CNBC, Hassett said there were many reasons to be optimistic about the US economy and that that tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico and China were already bringing manufacturing and jobs to the United States. \n\"There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward,\" he said. \nHe admitted there were some \"blips in the data\" for this quarter, which he pinned on the timing of Trump's tariffs and the \"Biden inheritance\".

But if we get going with the government then I think it's a five-year project, not a 10-year project,\" said Ratcliffe.\nThe club plan to build large parts of the stadium off-site before shipping it to the Old Trafford site via the Manchester ship canal.\n\"It will be a modular build - that means it can be built far more quickly,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"There are yards which specialise in building very large structures, which are then shipped to locations around the world.\"\nArchitect Norman Foster added: \"Normally a stadium would take 10 years to build, we halved that time - five years. How do we do that? By pre-fabrication, by using the network of Manchester ship canal, bring it back to a new life, shipping in components, 160 of them, Meccano-like.\"\nThere is no confirmed starting date.\nRatcliffe says the project will depend on how 'quickly' the government are with kick-starting their regeneration project of the area.\n\"On the timeline for this, it starts with a discussion,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"It depends how quickly the government get going with their regeneration programme. I think they want to get going quite quickly, because they want to see progress in this parliament.\n\"I'm assuming that will go well and it will go quickly.\"\nUnited's chief operating officer Collette Roche says the club will work closely with the authorities to make the project proceed \"as smooth and quick as possible\".\n\"One of the things we are establishing is a mayoral development corporation, that gives a lot of rights to speed these things through,\" she added.\n\"You also heard today that Jim mentioned us potentially doing some pre-fabrication. So that means we can do a lot of the enabling works and start to design and build the pieces in advance of having to do anything on the ground in Old Trafford.\"\nIt is unclear what will happen to United's existing home - but it looks unlikely the current Old Trafford will be kept.\nArchitects Foster and Partners had suggested Old Trafford would be demolished - and there is no sign of the current stadium in the new artists impressions.\nGiven the proximity of the new stadium to the current site, this option looks likely.\n\"By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford,\" Ratcliffe said.\nIt had been suggested in 2024 that the current stadium could be scaled back and used as a home for United's women and youth teams.\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said the club may revisit that plan, but it is \"unlikely\".\n\nThat's the ambition.\nBerrada says the club wants to grow the women's team fanbase enough for them to play at the main stadium, which could incorporate matches or events with smaller capacities.\nHe added they were looking at pitch technology that would allow for the surface to be in \"mint condition\" for both the men's and women's teams.\nRoche added: \"The great thing about having this type of stadium is it can actually be creative for different venues.\n\"There is technology now that can still give you a sense of a smaller, great atmospheric stadium. That could benefit the women's team with a smaller crowd \u2013 and that's the kind of thing we are looking at.\"\nManchester United say the new stadium will cost about \u00a32bn.\n\"We're looking at a ballpark [figure] of \u00a32bn,\" Berrada told BBC sports editor Dan Roan.\nThe club have not said how the stadium will be financed.\nThere are several options on the table, such as loans, private investment or investment from co-owner Ratcliffe.\nHowever, the proposal to build a new \u00a32bn stadium runs alongside the cost-cutting measures being made by Ratcliffe since his investment in the club.\n'What we're doing now is try to put ourselves in the best financial position to be able to finance a stadium and other infrastructure projects,\" said Berrada.\n\"Our aim is to be the most profitable club within three years. We think this will put us in the best financial footing to make this investment and to work with private investors who are willing to work with us.\"\nThe club are more than \u00a31bn in debt.\nHowever, football finance expert Kieran Maguire says the club have more headroom to borrow money.\n\"The good news for Manchester United is that the club is in a position to borrow substantial sums, despite existing levels of debt,\" Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"If the club does borrow a substantial amount of the estimated \u00a32bn cost of the new stadium, it is likely to do so with some form of interest only loan.\n\"When Tottenham took a similar approach to building a new stadium in London a few years ago, they negotiated at very low interest rates. These loans have resulted in Tottenham's interest costs rising from \u00a312m in the final season at White Hart Lane in 2016-17 to \u00a346m in 2022-23. During that same period matchday income had increased by \u00a372m and commercial income by \u00a3155m.\n\"The increase in commercial income is due to the club having a bigger multi-function stadium, used for a myriad football and non-football events such as NFL, music concerts and boxing.\"\nSpeaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Ratcliffe said: \"The financing is not the issue, I think it's eminently financeable. But the detail of that we'd rather talk about in the future. It will be financeable, I think.\"\nRatcliffe told the Overlap podcast, external that no public money will be used to build the stadium, but the project will not be possible without wider regeneration funded by the government.\n\"We can't afford to regenerate southern Manchester. It is too big a bill for the club,\" he said.\n\"We don't need any government funding for the stadium, but it has to be the underpin for the regeneration.\"\nAccording to Berrada, no.\n\"We don't want to inhibit our ability to invest in the team, for us to continue being competitive while we are building a new stadium,\" he added.\n\"There are various ways around that. One of the things we are looking at is to shorten the construction timelines.\n\"In the meantime, by getting our finances back in order and becoming profitable, we believe that we can be very competitive.\n\"The big, big benefit that this club has is that it has the biggest fanbase in the world and therefore the ability to be the number one in terms of revenues that it generates.\"\nRoche added: \"Our number one goal is to get our teams winning and to get the men's team competing for all the titles consistently. We are not going to deviate from that.\"\n'Some Man Utd players not good enough & overpaid'\nThe new stadium is to be built next to Old Trafford, which Ratcliffe hopes will \"preserve the essence\" of their current home.\nThe new stadium will form part of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already given Government backing to the plans.\nUnited say the project has the potential to create 92,000 new jobs, bring an additional 1.8 million visitors to the area annually and will be worth an additional \u00a37.3bn per year to the UK economy.\nOld Trafford's current capacity is 74,310, so the new stadium will accommodate more than 25,000 new spectators.\nHow will United fill it? And who will they be?\n\"Those Manchester United fans on the waiting list for season tickets may be disappointed if they thought the additional capacity of the stadium would result in many more season tickets becoming available,\" said Maguire. \n\"Manchester United have a huge global fanbase who are more likely to be willing to pay higher prices than those available to season ticket holders. Liverpool have in recent years increased the capacity of Anfield from 45,000 to over 61,000 as owners Fenway Sports Group have made most of the extra tickets available to fans in the membership scheme rather than those who want to have a coveted season ticket.\"\nIn a statement, the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) said fans \"remain anxious\" about the plans and whether ticket prices will be driven up, forcing out local supporters.\n\"We look forward to further consultation with supporters discussing these vital questions with the club. If they are able to produce a new stadium as stunning as the plans suggest without harming the atmosphere, without hiking ticket prices and without harming investment elsewhere, then this could be very exciting.\n\"But until the questions are answered, our optimism about plans to make Old Trafford the biggest and the best again will be restrained by caution about what the consequences for fans might be.\"\nMan Utd's new \u00a32bn stadium - all the key reaction and best images\nFans tell of hopes and fears for new Man Utd stadium\nThis video can not be played\nWatch promotional film of Man Utd's new stadium\nArchitects at Foster and Partners, who will design the project, said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is \"twice the size of Trafalgar Square\".\nThe design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200 metres high and visible from 25 miles away.\n\"As you move away from the stadium, it's not a fortress surrounded by a sea of cars.

        "article_text": "Reflecting back on the Netflix hit based on his own life, there are two things that come to mind for Palestinian comedian Mo Amer.\nPride and hurt.\n\"It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\nHe is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.\nThe character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.\nMaking a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.\n\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.\nThere was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.\nThe final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.\nThat's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nThis triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nAvoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says. \nThe show is ultimately \"grounded in comedy\", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.\n\"You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,\" says Mo.\nMo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".\n\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.\nThere was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.\n\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.\n\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"\nThe show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.\nIt tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.\nFrom his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.\nMo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.\nThe West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.\nAlong with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what is widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nIsrael occupied the areas in the 1967 Middle East war and built settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.\nPalestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.\n\"I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,\" Mo says.\nHe adds it was \"not only Palestinians\" contacting him.\nMo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was \"almost like we filmed a movie\" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.\nHe says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.\n\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"\nMo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.\n\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.\n\"You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.\"\nMo says he can't \"walk away\" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling \"like public property at this point\".\n\"I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations. But I'm not going to shy away from it,\" he says.\n\"Those that agree with me or disagree with me\u2026 it's important to continue the dialogue and have a conversation.\"\nThe ceasefire agreement in Gaza has provided some hope that there could be an end to fighting, but it has also felt fragile with concern that deal could collapse.\nMo says he is \"always hopeful\" things can get better.\n\"I never lose hope. \n\"If you do, then it becomes a really, really sad place whenever you're devoid of hope,\" he says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Electric Jeeps and carbon credits are unlikely to make up for gas-guzzling private flights and building mini towns in the remote savannah. So, what should travellers be looking for?\nFourteen Jeeps idle near the dozing lion cubs, burning fuel. The smell of petrol hangs in the morning air as a couple of guides illegally park off-road in Botswana's Chobe National Park, crushing the vegetation so their guests can get a better view. One by one the vehicles pull away towards other animals or to their lodges where their passengers will have lunch \u2013 likely flown and driven in from South Africa \u2013 before boarding a tiny bush plane themselves.\nGas-guzzling private flights and building mini towns in the remote savannah might seem at odds with one of the industry's most notable movements: green travel. Yet responsible safaris play an important role in conservation by expanding protected areas, investing in environmental research and creating economic support for local communities. Now, as the pressure of climate change rises, an increasing numbers of travellers are seeking out environmentally and socially ethical safaris that minimise their carbon footprint. According to one report by B Corp-certified travel advisor Go2Africa, interest in sustainable safaris has grown by more than 1000% over the last four years.\nIn response, many of the continent's largest and most popular safari operators tout carbon-neutral (and even carbon-positive) trips, swapping out traditional Jeeps with electric vehicles, installing fields of solar panels and purchasing carbon credits to make up for their guests' air travel. With them, it's promised, travellers can enjoy a guilt- and carbon footprint-free vacation.\nBut some sustainability experts suggest that these efforts might be a savvy attempt to tap into society's rising climate anxiety, which is at an all-time high according to a recent survey by the World Economic Forum. At best, safari operators simply know what will grab the attention of eco-conscious travellers.\n\"It's called green-crowding,\" says Judy Kepher-Gona, executive director of Sustainable Travel and Tourism Africa, a consulting company that helps destinations and businesses achieve their sustainability goals. \"Marketers in the tourism industry are smart. If you talk about carbon neutrality, people hear you more than when you talk about sustainability generally. It's easier to understand and, for lack of a better word, sexier \u2013 so they crowd around that term.\"\nThe African elephant in the room: is there such a thing as a true carbon-neutral safari?\n\"I suppose that in a spreadsheet it might be possible,\" says Lisa Scriven, general manager of Fair Trade Tourism and Africa Coordinator of Green Destinations.\nData manipulation, loopholes and even differing opinions of what defines a \"carbon-neutral\" camp make it difficult to know how strict safari operators are being when they tout the label. For example, Scriven says that some lodges claim to be carbon neutral yet decline to calculate their Scope 3 emissions, which include everything they don't produce. In remote Africa, where every supply, guest, employee and bottle of imported Champagne must travel long distances to reach a private concession in the middle of the Serengeti or Okavango Delta, this cost can quickly skyrocket.\nThoughtful Travel\nWant to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nBoth Kepher-Gona and Scriven also warn against blindly buying into the promise of carbon offsetting, which most carbon-neutral operators include automatically as a levy or offer for a fee to guests. To be effective, reputable carbon-offset programmes should be linked directly to the destination you're visiting and invest in climate justice. When in doubt about the legitimacy of a camp's initiative, Scriven suggests checking with a third-party such as Credible Carbon. In the worst-case scenario, a well-meaning lodge may not purchase their carbon credits wisely; unfortunately, the market has become rife with scams.\nEven when a safari comes close to carbon neutrality, sustainability experts agree that achieving net-zero carbon emissions alone is not enough to ensure a long-term, eco-friendly future. In fact, it can distract from bigger, more relevant issues.\n\"I think when a business says they're carbon neutral, there's immediate awe,\" says Scriven \"It's not greenwashing because maybe they are carbon neutral. But it can be very misleading in terms of the potential burden they're placing on the destination.\"\nGrant Cumings, managing director of Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, agrees. \"Just because a company is climate positive, that does not mean it's taking good care of the wildlife, habitat, local people or the economy of Zambia. All these are just as important \u2013 in my view, more important.\"\nThere's good news, however. More responsible safari brands than ever before are reducing their carbon emissions while simultaneously developing multifaceted standards that extend throughout their business. Segera, the founding member of The Long Run \u2013 a network of nature-based tourism businesses that includes some of Africa's top purpose-driven safaris such as Singita Kruger National Park and Tswalu \u2013 defines its commitment through the 4Cs framework: conservation, community, culture and commerce.\nOriginally a cattle ranch, the property has transformed into East Africa's largest private conservancy\u00a0reforestation project and a thriving wildlife sanctuary, with plans to reintroduce critically endangered rhinos in 2025. Located in Laikipia, Kenya, a region known for historic land injustices since the colonial British government pushed the Maasai out in the early 20th Century, Segera prioritises its relationship with neighbouring villages.\n\"Carbon neutrality is one part of sustainability, but we focus a lot more on the community,\" says Joy Juma, programme manager of the ZEITZ Foundation that spearheads Segera's sustainable initiatives. \"We empower them to be part of the value chain by providing employment opportunities, bursaries, education and medical care.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How will air pollution change where and when we travel?\n\u2022\u00a0Could the airship be the answer to sustainable air travel?\n\u2022\u00a0Is it time to change how we buy travel souvenirs?\nIn addition to community work, conservation is a key standard. Protecting animals from poachers, using environmentally responsible building materials and reducing waste are a starting point, but forward-thinking brands are taking the initiative a step further with transformative biodiversity and environmental management projects. In South Africa, &Beyond Phinda are working on a pangolin reintroduction programme while workers are creating a critical buffer zone for mountain gorillas at Rwanda's Singita lodge.\n\nWith so many layered aspects of sustainability to consider, it's understandable that the average traveller might become easily overwhelmed and feel tempted to fall back on a single metric, such as carbon neutrality. To avoid greenwashing, experts suggest choosing a property that's received a recognised, well-regarded sustainability certification \u2013 legitimate organisations do independent, on-site audits at least every three years. Dr Andrea Ferry, group sustainability coordinator at Singita, also suggests checking a lodge's website for clear data about their spending on conservation and community projects. Partnering with nonprofits is another good sign.\n\"Lodges that have a high sustainability maturity level are likely to have a separate fund or trust that performs the conservation and community work,\" she says.\nGuests must also be bold enough to ask the right questions prior to booking in order to hold operators accountable, says Kepher-Gona. \"Ask them: what are your sustainability principles? Have the claims that you make been verified by a third party? How do you measure your targets? Where is your last report? What have you done for the local community in the last 30 years?\" A legitimately sustainable property should be proud of their answers. According to Ferry, some lodges are excited to invite guests to view their recycling facilities, rainwater harvesting, solar power system and more.\nAbove all, camps must prioritise accountability and transparency while acknowledging room for improvement and growth. For example, Segera hopes to reduce fuel use and switch to electric vehicles for game viewing, while Singita is working towards a system to calculate full Scope 3 carbon emissions and better manage water consumption.\n\"Sustainability is multifaceted and it is rare to find perfect solutions,\" says Ferry. \"The more holistically one can think, the better the solution.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

The protesters later marched further south toward city hall. At least one person was detained.\n\"We're facing a horrifying reality that our own student, a member of the Columbia community, has become a political prisoner here in the United States,\" Columbia University Professor Michael Thaddeus said in a statement. \nThe judge set a hearing for Wednesday where Mr Khalil is expected to make an appearance, according to court documents. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents informed Mr Khalil they were revoking his student visa and green card upon taking him into custody on Saturday, his lawyer said. \nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused the former student of \"leading activities aligned to Hamas\" but provided no details. The BBC has asked the agency for further information on the allegations.\nTrump has previously stated that foreign students found to be \"terrorist sympathisers\" would face deportation. Mr Khalil is the first known detainee under this policy.\nHis lawyer, Amy Greer, condemned his detention as \"terrible and inexcusable\", calling it part of \"the US government's open repression of student activism and political speech\". \nMr Khalil, a Palestinian refugee who was born in Syria, has not been charged with any crime.\nICE agents detained him at his university-owned Manhattan apartment and initially placed him in a New Jersey immigration facility before transferring him to a detention centre in Jena, Louisiana, according to ICE records. \nHis attorney claims ICE also threatened to arrest his wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant. When she attempted to visit him in New Jersey, officials told her he was not there.\nColumbia University stated that law enforcement can enter campus property with a warrant but denied that university leadership had invited ICE agents.\nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed the administration's stance, posting on X: \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\nThe Trump administration announced last week it was rescinding $400m (\u00a3310m) in federal grants to Columbia, accusing it of failing to fight antisemitism on campus.\nColumbia was the epicentre last year of pro-Palestinian student protests nationwide against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel.\nMr Khalil was lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest when its protesters set up a huge tent encampment on the university lawn in protest against the Gaza war.\nHe later told the BBC he had been temporarily suspended by the university, where he was a graduate student at the School of International and Public Affairs.\nNew York Civil Liberties Union President Donna Lieberman called his deportation \"targeted retaliation and an extreme attack on the First Amendment.\" \nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said she was \"extremely concerned\" and monitoring the case.\nSome Jewish students at Columbia claim that protest rhetoric sometimes crossed the line into antisemitism, while others have joined the the pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\nCarly, a Jewish-American graduate student at Columbia and a friend of Mr Khalil, told the BBC that the detainee was a \"very, very caring soul\".\n\"He has been very targeted online and just seeing how he has been so misrepresented, it's very painful, as someone who knows him on a personal level,\" said Carly, who declined to share her surname for privacy reasons. \nSpeaking on Fox News, Trump's border tsar Tom Homan alleged that Mr Khalil had violated the terms of his visa by \"locking down buildings and destroying property\". \nThe Israeli military launched its campaign against Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack into Israel on 7 October 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage.\nMore than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nWith additional reporting from Nada Tawfik",

The Kremlin said earlier on Tuesday it would issue a statement after being briefed by Washington on the outcome of the talks.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Russia is already heavily sanctioned by the US over the war.\nTrump said he was contemplating the move because \"Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now\".\nMeanwhile, the war continued on the ground on Tuesday.\nThree men were killed in the Moscow region in what was described as the largest drone attack on the Russian capital since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine.\nA further 18 people, including three children, were injured, health officials told Russian media.\nThe Russian defence ministry said 337 drones were intercepted over Russia and 91 of them were shot down over the Moscow region.\nUkrainian officials reported Russian drone attacks on the capital Kyiv and several other regions.\nUkraine's air force said it had shot down 79 of 126 drones launched by Russia, as well as an Iskander-M ballistic missile.\nIt was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties.",

And they don't come cheap.\n\"Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,\" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. \"From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge.\n\"Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen.\"\nAirport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access.\nBut now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too.\nJP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business.\nFor American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan.\nIts Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars.\nIt's designed for Centurion card holders \u2013 a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one.\n\"We're more than a credit card company or a charge card company, it's more a lifestyle brand, getting you special access to concerts, getting you into restaurants,\" says Audrey Hendley, the head of global travel at American Express.\nThe card issuers have even moved into a 21st Century staple, the coffee shop.\nCapital One have Capital One Caf\u00e9s - now you have a barista in a bank.\nTheir branch in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC has all the classic signs of the hip coffee shop - exposed vents, bare brick walls, barista coffee machine.\nThe only immediate giveaway you might be in the bank is the neon Capital One sign on the wall and their branded touch screens. Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs.\nAnyone can use the caf\u00e9, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew.\n\"We're creating a showroom for our products,\" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes.\n\"For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for.\"\nNone of this sounds like the sort of language you hear normally hear from financial institutions.\nDan Bennett is the head of behavioural science the ad giant Ogilvy. He says this is all about brands tapping into how people think about themselves, and other people.\n\"Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,\" he says. \"It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated.\n\"The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that.\n\"And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens.\"\nBut even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work.\nHe points out that credit cards are more expensive for merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee. \nProf Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards.\n\"We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,\" he explains.\n\"If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers. Well-off people get to use the high merchant fee, high reward cards, and then it's the rest of society that has to bear that cost.\"\nWhoever is picking up the cost, the direction of travel is clear. More lounges and lifestyle experiences are coming as card issuers compete against each other.\nThe arms race to get your credit card loyalty isn't slowing down.",

It was, at the time, the world's worst air disaster.\n\"A man from the rugby club came up and he just shook his head,\" recalled Betty Rossiter, the sister of one of the victims.\nHer brother, David Hawkins - known as Dai - had boarded the plane with his wife Kathleen, who he had married only six months earlier.\nThe couple had saved up \u00a310 each for the trip as a honeymoon - an added element of anticipation ahead of a Five Nations game which promised a Triple Crown if Wales won.\n\"It was very exciting. I remember my mother saying, 'our Dai's going on an aeroplane, I hope he'll be alright',\" recalled Mrs Rossiter.\nThe moment they learned that Dai and Kathleen had been killed, Mrs Rossiter, 85, said her mother \"just went to pieces, and my father\".\n\"My mother was never the same after,\" she added. \"It was a terrible, terrible time.\"\nAmong those watching out for the plane on that fateful day was a nearby RAF squadron whose commanding officer, Bill Irving, was on board.\n\"It was with some horror that they saw the plane approaching and it suddenly lurched upwards and crashed to the ground,\" explained Flt Lt Martin Wade, historian for 614 County of Glamorgan squadron.\n\"Many of our officers raced towards the runway to the scene of the crash and were among the first at the scene,\" he added. \n\"They sadly had the duty of pulling their commanding officer's body from the plane, alongside all the others who lost their lives.\"\nAll five crew members on board the Avro Tudor plane were killed, alongside 75 passengers.\nThe devastation would come to \"haunt\" the RAF officers who witnessed it, according to Flt Lt Wade.\nAn investigation would later find the plane may have been overloaded, and that extra baggage had not been weighed.\nSeven of those killed were linked to the rugby club in the village of Llanharan, Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nLlanharan was much smaller then than it is today, meaning the impact was particularly far reaching.\n\"I remember the funeral of all the victims coming though Llanharan - the biggest I have ever seen in my life,\" remembers Alan Rossiter, Betty Rossiter's husband, who was a 10 year old child living in the village at the time.\n\"It was a sad day for Llanharan because there was so many of them.\"\nAlan Jenkins, a club member at Llanharan RFC, has looked back through the club's archives from the time.\n\"There was quite a long time before there was any mention of it in the club's minutes,\" he said. \n\"For several weeks after there were no meetings held, and it was as if it never happened. \n\"My perception of that is it was just too big - they didn't quite know how to handle it as a club.\"\nIncredibly, three people survived the crash.\nTwo of them - Handel Rogers, who became president of the Welsh Rugby Union, and his brother-in-law Gwyn Anthony - were sat at the back of the plane in extra seats, newly fitted.\nThe third, Mel Thomas from Llanharan RFC, was in the toilet at the time of impact.\nSpeaking to BBC Wales on the 60th anniversary, he said he could not remember much of the accident.\nAbercarn, in Caerphilly county, was another village that was deeply affected by the crash.\nFour members of Abercarn's local rugby were among the dead.\nAlbert John Robbins - known as Jack - was one of the men who died.\nHe had been Abercarn RFC's baggage boy, unable to play rugby any more after being severely wounded in WW2.\nAccording to Mr Robbins' niece, Michelle Iles, he had \"jumped at the chance\" of a ticket to go on the trip after another family member had to pull out.\nIt was a cruel twist of fate for Mr Robbins and so many of those who lost their lives.\n\"For these families to get their boys back from the war who had fought for their country and to come through that and to lose them in this tragic accident, it was just devastating,\" she reflected.\nMs Iles recalled seeing two precious items at her grandparents' house during her childhood, both of which had belonged to her uncle Jack - a shoe and a wallet. \nThese were all that could be recover from the plane's wreckage that belonged to him.\nThe disaster is remembered on both Llanharan and Abercarn RFC's badges to this day.\nTo mark the 75th anniversary, an RAF flypast at the site of the crash and a memorial event took place last Sunday.\nAmong those who spoke was Cerrig Day, 16, from Abercarn RFC who said he felt it was his generation's responsibility to pass on the story.\n\"These boys kept this club alive - we feel it's really important to make sure the history lives on,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan met with LIV counterpart Yasir Al Rumayyan and US President Donald Trump last month\nThe Players Championship 2025\nVenue: TPC Sawgrass Date: 13-16 Mar\nCoverage: Live radio and text commentaries of the third and fourth rounds. Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 March\nWhile negotiations aimed at reunifying men's golf grind to a halt, the PGA Tour is taking steps to speed up play.\nCommissioner Jay Monahan's state of the union news conference, before this week's Players Championship here at Sawgrass, made clear that eradicating slow play has become more of a priority than ever before for a circuit that has always indulged slowcoaches.\nBut this, the tour's marquee tournament, will again be played in the shadow of the ongoing split brought about by the arrival in 2022 of the breakaway LIV tour.\nThis year's Players will play out in the absence of the reigning US Open champion.  Last year the Masters winner was missing and in 2023 there was no title defence.\nThis, of course, is because Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith all play on LIV.\nTheir absence from the PGA Tour is felt more keenly this week than any other. The old debate as to whether the Players is the 'fifth' major is no longer relevant and will not be until the game reunifies.\nHere we have the most stark imperative for a deal to be done with LIV's Saudi backers.\nAn agreement, though, is not imminent. \nMonahan reiterated that no follow-up meetings are in the diary after the recent White House gathering with the Saudi Public Investment Fund's governor Yasir Al Rumayyan ended without settlement.\n\"We appreciate Yasir's innovative vision,\" Monahan said. \"And we can see a future where we welcome him on to our board and work together to move the global game forward.\n\"As part of our negotiations, we believe there's room to integrate important aspects of LIV Golf into the PGA Tour platform. We're doing everything that we can to bring the two sides together.\"\nMonahan added that while his organisation has \"removed some hurdles, others remain\". \nIn other words, something has to give to end the stalemate.\n'Hurdles' in PGA-LIV deal - but Trump 'bolstering' talks\nAnd no matter how hard the golf media tried, the commissioner flat-batted every enquiry as to how that might be achieved.  \nMonahan does not play verbal 'Bazball'; every non-answer dictated by the delicate nature of golf's future.\nWhere he was more forthcoming, was an acceptance - at long last - that men's professional golf has a problem with slow play.  It seems steps are being taken where the biggest offenders will start to be named and shamed.\n\"We've committed to addressing the speed of play,\" Monahan said as he announced working group recommendations that will be implemented to try to erase one of the sport's biggest blights.\n\"We will begin publishing speed-of-play-related statistics later this season,\" he added.  From 14 April testing will begin on the PGA Tour's feeder circuits to impose stroke penalties on the slowest golfers.\nMonahan also confirmed that the use of range finders will be allowed at tournaments between next month's Masters and the US PGA Championship in May to see whether this improves round times.\n\"We're listening to our fans and we're responding, and clearly this is something where they would like to see improvement,\" the commissioner said.\n\"I think there's a real commitment from players across the board to make certain that we're doing everything that we possibly can to improve, and these three steps are just a start.\"\nThis is a marked shift from an organisation that for decades insisted that slow play was not a problem. The rival LIV circuit has imposed stroke penalties on slowcoaches and now the PGA Tour is starting to respond.\n\"I look at this as a very positive development,\" Monahan insisted.\n\"I think it's pretty telling that when you've got six player directors that sit on our boards, and you've got 16 members of our Player Advisory Council, that there's a lot of shaking of heads and there's an understanding that this is an area where we need to improve.\"\nTwo-time major winner Collin Morikawa says publishing data that shows which players are quicker than others, thereby identifying the slowest, is a good idea. \n\"I don't know why you wouldn't want it to be released,\" said the 2021 Open winner.\n\"You just have to start giving guys actual penalties, whether it be strokes or FedExCup (point deductions). What I've learned is that monetary fines are useless.\"\nMorikawa added:  \"What is there to hide, right? If you're slow, you know you're slow. I mean, if you don't know, then there's an issue.\n\"To me, there's no issue with letting it out. It's only going to make things better because then you're either going to have a target on you, put a little more pressure and hopefully you pick it up, or you get penalised. It's very simple.\"\nDouble US PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas agrees that publicly revealing which players are the slowest will have a beneficial effect. \n\"Nobody wants to be known as that,\" said the US Ryder Cup star.\n\"I'm the first to admit I'm on the slow side of players. It bothers me, but I've talked to many officials about it, like I want to know why I'm slow because obviously the first thing that any slower player thinks is that they're not slow.\"\nFans will surely welcome such long-awaited initiatives to improve pace of play on the game's biggest tour.\nBut those awaiting some kind of resolution that brings the game back together are still left playing the waiting game.",

        "article_text": "Anita Smith has always been cautious about how much she shared online.\nBut her concerns increased following an abusive relationship with a partner, who later stalked her. \nAlthough police intervened, she left the UK and also scaled back her online profile.\n\"I erased my online presence as much as I possibly could, including removing the locations of some posts, and a couple of Instagram accounts,\" says Ms Smith, whose name has been changed for this article.\nMs Smith, who works in communications, still has a LinkedIn account but doesn't use her full name.\n\"I deleted quite a few things off my LinkedIn too, lots of things that were location based, although a few posts do remain.\n\"I have posted recently as I'm trying to build a brand although I'm sceptical as to how much I share.\"\nShe has kept an original private Facebook account: \"I cleanse it once a year, and check on photos and privacy of posts and where I have been tagged.\"\nMs Smith has also become more aware of the terms and conditions of social media platforms.\n\"I follow AI trends and I know a lot of images are training AI models and we don't have ethical guidelines on how they can be used. That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want.\"\nAs scams become more sophisticated, research suggests that more people are concerned about the information they share online.\nIn a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN.\nThere are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles.\n\"First of all, people underappreciate privacy,\" says Vytautas Kaziukonis, chief executive at Surfshark, a security software company that encrypts user's online data and aims to make browsing secure.\n\"What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment.\"\nAnother issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis.\n\"Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,\" he says.\nAI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a \"deadly combination\", says Mr Kaziukonis. \nAlso, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.\nMr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.\nSo what can we do to minimise our footprints?\nFirstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.\n\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.\n\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"\nIt's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted. \n\"They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.\nGus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.\nHe suggests using a VPN (virtual private network) which, for a price, offers a user more privacy when online. \nHe also recommends cookie-blockers and selecting web browsers with privacy controls.\n\"The underlying solution remains that we must keep the pressure on our governments to have strong laws to protect everyone,\" Mr Hosein says.\nKaren Renaud is a computing scientist at the University of Strathclyde  working on security and privacy.\nLast year she studied 15 privacy policy documents, which lay out what a company is going to do with your data.\nShe found that the most complicated of them would take 32 minutes to read and would require college-level education to understand.\n\"The situation is pretty dire,\" she says.\nShe advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.\n\"Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.\"\nSome people turn to services such as DeleteMe and Surfshark, which help remove personal information from data brokers.\nAmanda Unterreiner, product manager at US-based data removal service DeleteMe, says high-profile individuals like video gamers and judges use their service as a safety measure.\n\"In the case of judges\u2026 because if they're announcing some decision, someone might show up at their house.\"\nShe also mentions the case of the killing earlier last year of United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson.\n\"Stories like that kind of spark regular people to think I better get protected.\"\nMs Unterreiner went through the process of having her data removed when she joined the company.\n\"You could see every other place I had ever lived, every phone number I've ever had, every email address, on the first page of Google. If someone wanted to steal my identity\u2026 they would be able to cause some real personal damage.\"\nThe company also offers a service to mask your house on Google Maps.\n\"You can look at street view, but that particular property will just be kind of very pixelated.\"\nThere's multiple reasons why Saam Collingwood, who lives near Stratford-upon-Avon, has cut back her online profile over the years. \nThe first was following an incident at work where she had included her personal Facebook account on an email to a client and her employer was unhappy.\n\"They were able to see photos from a night out,\" she says. \"That didn't go down too well.\"\nIn another incident she was trolled by a stranger online after posting a video of herself learning a dance routine on YouTube.\nPlus, rising online fraud convinced her to further reduce her online profile.\nShe hasn't completely erased her online presence but she no longer posts regularly on Facebook, reducing it about twice a year. \n\"I don't like it when people tag me, people knowing I'm not at home. Most times I remove the tag.\"\nShe says she has upgraded her anti-virus and security software with a service from online security firm Norton. \n\"I wanted to make sure websites weren't taking my details. It makes me more comfortable.\"\nBut are there any downsides to not being so present online?\n\"I miss seeing old friends [on Facebook] and people I would contact once or twice year,\" says Ms Smith.\nMr Kaziukonis says it's common to hear people say they don't care about privacy but he believes this is a flawed argument.\n\"They say I have nothing to hide. But would they mind sharing every single email they have sent? We have curtains at home, we want to feel private. It's human nature.\"",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump.\nThe former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. \nIn much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"  \nCarney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nCarney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. \nThe Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. \nCarney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.\nLoud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital.  \nThe party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. \nCarney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\nThe governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country\nAt the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.\nThey have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.\nMuch of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. \nThe US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy.\nCarney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was \"attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses\". \n\"We can't let him succeed,\" he added, as the crowd booed loudly.\nHe said his government would keep tariffs on US imports \"until the Americans show us respect\".\nCanada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed.\n\"I know these are dark days,\" Carney said. \"Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. \n\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\nCarney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.\nThe US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.\n\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney. \n\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"\nShortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.\nHe warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.\nThe Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".\nThey accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.\nPoilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. \nCarney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December.\nFederal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he \"embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues\". \n\"I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election.\" \nThe Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. \nThe former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left.\nA major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years.\nHe has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US.\nDuring the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",

        "article_text": "From the catwalk to the red carpet, the jacket-and-necktie combo is back for women \u2013 it's a statement of power and authority, say fans of the look.\nThe jacket-and-necktie combination has been a staple of male dress for centuries, but it's always been most striking and subversive when worn by women. Now, it's making a comeback in women's fashion once more.\nOn runways, designers are re-inventing the look. In her recent London Fashion Week collection, Tolu Coker showcased oversized leather blazers, paired with satin ties and tailored shirts. While at New York Fashion Week, Thom Browne teamed classic pattern ties with structured patchwork jackets.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe trend isn't limited to the catwalk. Viewers of the recent Grammy awards may have noticed Sabrina Carpenter's Dolce & Gabbana show-girl outfit, a Swarovski crystal-encrusted black blazer, with matching tie and skirt. Billie Eilish even offers a tie as part of her official merchandise.\u00a0\nThe red carpet is adopting the look, too. At the Berlin Film Festival, Vicky Krieps wore an oversized Bottega Veneta suit. Meanwhile, Doechii styled a Thom Browne exaggerated trouser with a cropped jacket and tie to accept her Grammy win. Nicole Kidman has gone for the jacket-and-tie look too in YSL, joining a growing list of celebrities including Rihanna, Bella Hadid and Iris Law, who have all embraced the label's style of tailoring.\u00a0 \u00a0\nYasmine Tangou is also in the fan club. The content creator and architect, who lives in Paris, likes the oversized, masculine style of a YSL suit, in contrast to other styles of jacket that accentuate curves.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince moving to the French capital from Milan, Tangou has trawled vintage shops in search of men's suits. She prefers their structure. \"I like the movement in a men's garment and the wider, boxier silhouette,\"\u00a0she tells the BBC.\nOn TikTok, Tangou showcases her outfits to thousands of viewers, pairing ties with bomber jackets, trench coats and blazers. \"From a social point of view, I really like that wearing a tie and jacket is bold,\" she tells the BBC. \"People don't expect it on a woman.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to corporate-style looks, Tangou prefers the jacket and tie to the recent office-siren trend because it feels \"unsexualised,\" she says. \"I thought the office-siren look was really cool, but it was about showing off the body, whereas this look is about the garment.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\"Wearing a broad-shouldered jacket makes a statement,\" she says. \u00a0\"There is power in strong silhouettes.\" To balance the masculine structure of her outfits, Tangou draws inspiration from YS's approach. \"I always add a feminine touch,\" she explains. \"That could be a full face of makeup, a floral clutch bag or a pair of heels.\"\u00a0\nAlthough the jacket-and-tie look is experiencing a revival, this isn't the first time women's fashion has embraced it.\nFashion historian Linda Welters traces the trend back to the 19th Century, starting with bowties. She points to John Singer Sargent's 1897 painting of Mr and Mrs Stokes. In it, Mr Stokes stands behind his wife, who wears a bowtie and a shirtwaist \u2013 a women's blouse styled like a men's shirt, which was representative of the \"new woman\", in rejecting Victorian ideas of femininity.\nWelters, a professor at the University of Rhode Island, notes the necktie has long been associated with power and authority in both men's and women's fashion. It's why some suffragettes wore ties at the beginning of the 20th Century, while campaigning for the vote.\u00a0\nLater, in 1930, Marlene Dietrich created an iconic style moment when she wore a suit and bowtie in the film Morocco.\u00a0It was in the 1960s, though, when the suit and bowtie were first embraced by major fashion houses. In 1966, Yves Saint Laurent unveiled the Le Smoking tuxedo suit for women. Alas it was deemed ahead of its time among the designer's haute couture fans, with only one suit selling.\u00a0However the version created for Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear line Rive Gauche was a big success, attracting a younger clientele. Saint Laurent then went on to include it in each of his collections until his retirement in 2002.\nWhile women are increasingly turning to the tie and jacket, in recent years, the look has fallen out of favour in men's fashion, something that is noticeable in both politics and business. Some attribute this to the rise of remote work during Covid, while others see it as an attempt by powerful figures to appear more approachable. Some of the world's wealthiest and most influential businessmen, from Mark Zuckerberg to Jeff Bezos, rarely wear jackets and ties. President Zelensky avoids the suit as a mark of solidarity with Ukrainian soldiers.\u00a0\nWelters points out that, \"men have considered the jacket and tie optional for the last 15 years, with open-collar shirts becoming more common\". She says this shift in menswear has paved the way for womenswear to \"claim and feminise the look\".\u00a0\u00a0\nShe also connects the trend to global politics. \"Fashion labels are responding to a rise in conservative values,\" she says. \"Theres a growing perception that married women do fine at home, but designers are challenging this by styling women in jackets and ties which project authority and power.\"\u00a0\nHowever Dr Gaby Harris, a fashion cultures sociologist and lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, sees it differently. Although she agrees the trend is politically influenced, she links it to the era of dominant male leaders, such as President Donald Trump.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cJackets and ties have long been symbols of the powerful class \u2013 we refer to 'white-collar' workers,\u201d Harris tells the BBC. \u201cOver time, this style has become associated with dominance. Women adopting this look are aligning with a traditionally male expression of power, at a time when strong, macho leaders are in office.\"\u00a0\nHarris also attributes the trend to personal branding: \"We place significant value on individuals as brands, so wearing a jacket and tie make sense because it's a symbol of authority and competence. By wearing a tie and jacket on a red carpet, celebrities are projecting themselves as leaders and CEOs.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nNot everyone believes it's political though. For Holly Beddingfield, the suit revival is about a new generation enjoying office-wear for the first time. The editor of Capsule, a fashion and pop culture newsletter, describes herself as a \"Zillennial\", as she is at the older end of the Gen-Z age bracket.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe explains that for her generation office attire is a novelty. \"We haven't worked in formal environments before, and since lots of offices are ending working from home, we're thinking, 'why not have fun with dressing for work?'\"\u00a0\u00a0\nTies are not only a fun way to experiment with style but, as Beddingfield notes, \"a cheap way of making you feel put together\".\u00a0\n\"I really like masculine-inspired fashion,\" she tells the BBC. \"I wear lots of oversized-men's items, but that can stray into the territory of looking lazy and like I don't care. But a tie can take a boyish outfit, and make it look polished, in the same way having my nails done and wearing jewellery does too.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that suit-and-tie loving Bella Freud agrees with. In an interview last year with the BBC, the British designer recalled that as a teenager,\u00a0\"I put on this boy's shirt, and I stared at myself in the mirror. Suddenly I felt agile and powerful. It was a real moment for me\". \u00a0\u00a0\nAs a teenager who idolised tie-loving pop-rock stars Avril Lavigne and Hayley Williams in the Noughties, Beddingfield says she has waited a long time for them to be back in fashion, so when BoyGenius wore them for much of their tour last year, she was thrilled. \"It was always cool in America,\" she jokes, \"and finally it\u2019s becoming cool in the UK too\".\u00a0 \u00a0\nFor anyone wanting to introduce a jacket and tie combination to their wardrobe, Beddingfield advises \"keeping it simple\".\u00a0\n\"Take your current favourite bottoms, whether that's jeans or a skirt, and add a shirt, tie and your most-loved jacket,\" she says. \"Don't completely re-invent a new look because you won't feel comfortable \u2013 instead build on an outfit you already love.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US officials are headed to Russia to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, according to President Donald Trump. \nThe news comes after Ukrainian officials agreed to a 30-day ceasefire following a highly anticipated meeting with American officials in Saudi Arabia. \nEarlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the \"ball is truly in their [Russia's] court\" and that the US believes the only way to end the fighting is through peace negotiations. \nThe Kremlin has said it was studying the ceasefire proposal, and that a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is possible. \nFollowing the meeting in Jeddah on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky said it was now up to the US to convince Russia to agree to the \"positive\" proposal.\nSpeaking alongside Ireland's Taoiseach - or Prime Minister - Miche\u00e1l Martin in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said he had received  \"positive messages\" about the possibility of a ceasefire. \n\"But a positive message means nothing,\" he said. \"This is a very serious situation.\" \nTrump did not specify which officials were travelling to Moscow.\nHowever, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House that National Security Secretary Mike Waltz had spoken to his Russian counterpart. \nEarlier this week, a source familiar told the BBC that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would head to Moscow for negotiations following the talks in Jeddah. \nThe White House confirmed the plans on Wednesday. \n\"We urge the Russians to sign on to this plan. This is the closest we have been to peace in this war,\" Leavitt said. \nThe Kremlin has said it is studying the proposed ceasefire and further details, which spokesman Dmitry Peskov said will come \"via various channels\" over the course of the next several days. \nIn the Oval Office, Trump said that he believes a ceasefire would make sense for Russia, adding - without further details - that there is a \"lot of downside to Russia\" as well.\n\"We have a very complex situation solved on one side. Pretty much solved. We've also discussed land and other things that go with it,\" Trump added. \"We know the areas of land we're talking about, whether it's pull back or not pull back.\" \nTo pressure Russia, Trump said that he \"can do things financially\". \n\"That would be very bad for Russia,\" he said. \"I don't want to do that because I want to get peace.\" \nThe meeting in Jeddah was the first between US and Ukrainian officials since a 28 February meeting between Zelensky, Trump and Vice President JD Vance descended into a shouting match and, ultimately, a pause in US military assistance and intelligence sharing. \nThe pause was lifted following the meeting in Jeddah, and Trump said that he believes that the \"difficult\" Ukrainian side and Zelensky now want peace. \nEven as negotiations over a potential ceasefire are ongoing, fighting has raged in Ukraine. \nRussian drones and missiles reportedly struck targets in Kryvyy Rih - Zelensky's hometown - overnight, as well as in the port city of Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv. \nClashes also continued in Russia's Kursk region, where Peskov said Russian troops were \"successfully advancing\" and recapturing areas held by Ukrainian forces.\nAnd later on Wednesday, the Kremlin said President Putin had visited a command post in the region. He was shown in footage released by the Kremlin walking alongside his military chief Valery Gerasimov, with both men wearing combat gear.\nIt marked the Russian president's first visit to the region since Ukraine's incursion across the border in August last year.\nRussian media report that President Putin ordered the military to \"fully liberate\" the region during the visit.  He is yet to comment on the ceasefire proposal agreed by Ukraine and the US on Tuesday.\nThe head of Ukraine's military, Oleksandr Syrsky, also indicated on Wednesday that some of its troops were withdrawing from Kursk. In a post on the Telegram messaging app, he said: \"In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.\"",

Frankfurt, Germany's busiest airport, said passengers would be unable to board flights and transfer would \"almost certainly\" be affected.\nVerdi, which represents public sector and transport workers, is in an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions. \nGerman media reports thousands of flights could be cancelled across the day, disrupting travel for more than 500,000 passengers.\nThe Lufthansa group, whose main hub is in Frankfurt, confirmed \"delays and extensive cancellations\" across all its airlines.\nMeanwhile, Munich Airport warned of a \"greatly reduced flight schedule\". This includes flights by Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air.\nKatja Bromm, spokeswoman for Hamburg Airport, where all 143 departures scheduled on Monday have already been cancelled, said Verdi was \"dishonourable\" to call a strike without notice at the start of the holiday season.\nShe said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travellers who have nothing to do with the disputes\".\nA spokesman for Verdi accepted that the strike would affect many, but said the travel disruption was necessary to extracting a better pay offer. \nLars Stubbe, the union's Hamburg representative, told the BBC: \"The workers are aware that disruptions do happen, and they are uncomfortable with that, but in any case, it is the employer that caused these strikes because they haven't put a negotiable offer on the table.\"\nMany of Frankfurt Airport's 1,770 scheduled flights have already been cancelled, while the majority of Munich's 820 flights are expected to be cancelled.\nHundreds more cancellations are anticipated across Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Berlin. \nMany passengers had already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it returned, according to public broadcaster NDR. \nADV, which represents major German airports, said the strike had \"almost completely paralysed air traffic\".\nVerdi's demands include an 8% pay rise, or at least \u20ac350 (\u00a3294) more per month, for all workers - and three extra days of holiday, plus one additional day for union members. \nStubbe said that while airport wages range were above minimum wage, ranging from \u20ac13-\u20ac25 per hour, workers in different roles - particularly security staff - received less annual leave than others.\n\"There have been two rounds of negotiations in which the employers have not yet offered one penny,\" he added. \n\"It is quite usual that we don't get any offers in the first round, but now even in the second round, the employers have basically said, 'No, we're not going to give you an offer because we don't have any money'.\"\nBDLS, the body which sets security workers' pay, said in a statement: \"The damage caused by this strike is almost exclusively to companies that are not at the negotiating table.\"\nIt called on the government to outlaw short-notice strikes, adding that air transport was \"essential for Germany as a business location\" which \"must not be exploited\" in collective pay disputes.\nRalph Beisel, ADV's general manager, said the strike was having an impact on European and global air traffic, leading to missed connections due to a \"domino effect\".\nHe called for reforms to German strike laws concerning \"critical\" infrastructure. \nThe so-called \"warning strike\", an established tactic in German wage negotiations, concerns two separate pay disputes: one relating to airport security workers, and a broader disagreement over pay for federal and municipal government employees.\nVerdi has also called for strikes in waste collection across several German cities, including Berlin, Essen and Kiel, where bins have gone unemptied since last week.\nPay talks for government workers are set to restart on Friday in Potsdam, while the next round of talks for airport security staff is scheduled to begin on 26 March.\nNiklas Benrath, of the VKA, which regulates pay and conditions for municipal workers, also criticised the strikes, saying Verdi's demands would cost nearly \u20ac15bn.\n\"With a total municipal debt of around \u20ac160bn, these demands are not financially viable,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.\nNow two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture. \nHe has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.\nMeanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.\nSo is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\nA chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising. \nA JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs. \nThe forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.\nHe has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.\nThe latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however. \nPrices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.  \nStill, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success. \n\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty. \nThe posture has increased investor worries about his plans. \nGoldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\". \n\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned. \n\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like. \nInvestors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.\nBrian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool. \n\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.\nIn recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.\nRetail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.\nSome analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.\nThat could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation. \n\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.\n\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.\nBut the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says. \nThe unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump. \nInvestors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).\nChipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.\nThat type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy. \nNow, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.\nTech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.\n\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said. \nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.That type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.",

It was a bad fit when Arsenal desperately needed a goalscorer.\nThe sight of midfielder Mikel Merino labouring as an emergency striker to no effect emphasised how Arsenal had left that key position to the fates and lost.\nArteta admitted as much as he said: \"The efficiency we had in the last 20 metres wasn't good enough. We know that.\n\"To come to Old Trafford and do what we did is superb, but you have to capitalise and we didn't. We then had to try to overturn the result after going behind and you know how difficult that is here.\"\nThis does not take into account Arsenal had 48 hours more to prepare for this game than Manchester United, who played away to Real Sociedad in the Europa League on Thursday, and have injury problems of their own.\nArsenal, who won 7-1 at PSV in their Champions League last-16 first leg tie on Tuesday, had these factors in their favour but were still not good enough to cash in.\nRice scores equaliser but Arsenal held at Man Utd\n'We need more Brunos' - Fernandes 'steps up all the time' for Man Utd\nWhen could Liverpool seal Premier League title?\nA disappointed Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta after his side's Premier League title chase faltered again at Manchester United\nArteta, by most measures, has improved Arsenal and been successful. The only gauge that matters at a club of their stature, though, is the tangible success of trophies and he still only has their 2020 FA Cup success to show for his progress.\nThis is not to suggest the Spaniard has been a failure. Far from it.\nArteta, understandably, retains the complete faith of the Arsenal hierarchy as he has moved them in the right direction. And it is expected he will soon be working with a new sporting director in Andrea Berta, who is to succeed Edu after the Italian left the same position with Atletico Madrid in January.\nIn his first 200 matches, Arteta has 118 wins, the fifth highest tally of any manager in that amount of Premier League games.\nAnd since his appointment in succession to Unai Emery in 2019, only Pep Guardiola, his mentor at Manchester City when he was assistant manager there, has more victories and points in the Premier League.\nArteta also has eight more wins than Arsene Wenger achieved when he hit the mark of 200 top-flight matches.\nArsenal can also consider themselves live contenders for the Champions League, with a quarter-final place virtually assured after their spectacular away win at PSV.\nIt does mean, however, the pressure is increasing on Arteta to deliver a trophy that has eluded him for five years \u2013 if not this season, then certainly next.\nArsenal needed a miraculous injury-time save by keeper David Raya from Bruno Fernandes to prevent defeat at Manchester United\nArsenal must consider this season's title race a missed opportunity after running Manchester City close in the last two campaigns - only to stumble near the finishing line. City's unforeseen collapse opened the door to their rivals, but it is Arne Slot's Liverpool who have stepped through it, while the Gunners faltered once more.\nLiverpool's relentless march has seen them ease away from Arsenal, who have fallen away to such an extent that even the subdued reception from players and supporters in a corner of Old Trafford after the final whistle carried a resigned air.\nThey know the game is up.\nAsked if the title race is over in the press conference, having walked out when asked the same question by Sky Sports, the Arsenal boss said: \"I don't want to say that, but today the frustration is that we haven't won a game.\n\"We know the urgency and we are obligated to win every single match if you want to have any chance of doing that. I don't think it's the right moment to talk about that anyway.\"\nWhile it is effectively meaningless in the wider title context, it could have been even worse for Arsenal.\nGoalkeeper David Raya was culpable for Fernandes' opener, positioning himself too far to his right, allowing the Portuguese midfielder to show his expertise by planting the free-kick perfectly as the Spaniard scrambled away in vain to his left.\nThis video can not be played\nWall distance or keeper error? Why did Arsenal concede from Fernandes free-kick?\nRaya, however, made amends with two superb second-half saves from Noussair Mazraoui and Joshua Zirkzee, before a miraculous moment in the dying seconds. Having first blocked a shot from Fernandes, Raya somehow regained his position to claw the ball away from right on the line as a dramatic late United winner looked certain.\nIn between, it took a magnificent saving tackle from goalscorer Rice to rob United substitute Rasmus Hojlund as he raced into the area with only Raya to beat.\nIt will not make much difference to the destiny of the title. It simply emphasised that Arsenal's impotence at one end leaves them increasingly vulnerable at the other.\nAnd this reflects badly on Arteta and Arsenal's recruitment team, who failed to address an obvious problem up front last summer.\nAs he moves on from his managerial landmark, the urgency is growing to mark his progress in the manner that matters most.\nThat is by actually winning a trophy.\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 March\nNorthern Ireland's Rory McIlroy says he does not expect Tiger Woods to play again this year after the 15-time major winner's latest injury setback.\nOn Tuesday 49-year-old Woods had surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon.\nThe American has played a reduced schedule since suffering serious leg injuries in a car crash in 2021, and has not played in a PGA Tour event since The Open in July.\n\"It sucks,\" said McIlroy, who faced Woods in January in the technology-driven Tomorrow's Golf League (TGL) they co-founded.\n\"He doesn't have much luck when it comes to injuries and his body.\n\"Achilles surgeries obviously aren't fun. [I'm] hoping he's in good spirits and hoping he's doing OK.\n\"We obviously won't see him play golf this year, and hopefully we see him maybe play in 2026.\"\nAsked if he thought Woods would return to competitive golf, four-time major champion McIlroy said: \"I don't know what's in his head. But, judging by prior behaviour, he'll definitely try.\"\nMcIlroy has been largely injury-free since rupturing an ankle ligament in 2015, which forced him to miss the defence of his Open title.\nSpeaking before the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass starting on Thursday, the 35-year-old said he intends to retire with a \"little bit left in the tank\".\n\"I can acknowledge how lucky golfers are to be able to do what they do for so long compared to other athletes, so whenever I feel like the time is right, I'll have no problem moving aside and letting the next generation do their thing,\" said McIlroy.\n\"When I've achieved everything I want to achieve in the game and I get to the point where I don't think I can maybe do that any more.\n\"I don't want to be out there embarrassing myself. I'd like to walk away maybe a little before I should.\n\"There's always one more, but that's OK. If you can come to terms with that and walk away on your own terms, then that's a good thing.\"\nAsked about the prospect of playing on the Champions Tour, he said: \"Absolutely not. I will not play Champions Tour golf.\n\"I've said a lot of absolutes in my time that I've walked back, but I do not envision playing Champions Tour golf.\n\"Something has gone terribly wrong if I have to compete at golf at 50.\"\nMcIlroy won his 27th PGA Tour title at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am last month, and finished tied for 17th and 15th in his two tournaments since - the Genesis Invitational and Arnold Palmer Invitational respectively.\n\"The two finishes post-Pebble have been almost like the worst that they could be,\" said McIlroy.\n\"I finished bad on Sunday at Bay Hill. I finished bad on Sunday at Torrey Pines as well.\n\"But the one thing I would say is from the turnaround in my putting from Torrey to Bay Hill was great. I finished fifth in putting last week, so to see that turnaround was really encouraging.\n\"That's something for me to be really encouraged about going into this week and then the next few months.\"\nWorld number two McIlroy, who won the Players Championship in 2019, will tee off alongside world number one and defending champion Scottie Scheffler and world number three Xander Schauffele at 17:29 GMT on Thursday.",

I was shocked by the news, of course.\n\"I think the focus quickly shifted to what's next, what is important to the team and that's the final on Saturday.\"\nMan City boss Taylor sacked five days before cup final\nListen - Women's Football Weekly podcast: Reaction to Taylor sacking\nCity face Chelsea in Saturday's League Cup final (12:15 GMT kick-off), which is live on BBC One, in a run of four back-to-back games against the Blues.\nThey will then play Sonia Bompastor's side twice in their two-legged Champions League quarter-final, with a WSL meeting in between.\nTaylor had been a controversial figure at City, with several players speaking out publicly about their experiences during his time in charge, including England goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck describing her relationship with him as \"fractured\".\nHowever, Greenwood said she had a \"really positive\" relationship with the 52-year-old.\n\"I was his captain and we had a really healthy relationship,\" she added.\n\"I don't expect everyone to have the same relationship with the manager, that's football. Ultimately he has to make decisions and he's never going to please everyone.\"\nForward Vivianne Miedema told BBC Radio 5 Live that Taylor had \"helped her enjoy football again\" but the players\u2019 focus had to immediately turn to Saturday\u2019s final.\n\"We are professional footballers so coming in this morning, the switch needed to be on straight away,\" said Miedema.\n\"Nick [Cushing] left a really, really good impression straight away with lots of energy. The most important thing right now is to move forward to the big cup final on Saturday.\"\nCushing will be in charge for the remainder of the season, having previously helped City win the WSL and the FA Cup, plus the League Cup twice, before leaving in January 2020 to join MLS side New York City.\n\"We were excited by that appointment because he knows the club really well, he's been here before, he comes with a huge history of winning and his mentality to win is second to none,\" said Greenwood, who is currently sidelined with a knee injury. \n\"I had a really, really good chat with him on Tuesday morning.\n\"He had a great meeting with the team - a really, really positive one. It was ultimately about winning and what is achievable, what we need to focus on, which, first of all, is Saturday.\"\nFormer Manchester City players Ellen White and Jen Beattie, who both played under Taylor, have questioned the timing of the sacking. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly podcast, White said: \"Very odd timing I would say - it's super strange.\n\"I feel a bit sorry for him because [he has] a lot of injuries. But you've got to throw it back to the club at the same time to be like - are you invested into this team, where do you want this team to go?\n\"He could have gone months ago, last year potentially. I don't think they're in that bad a position at the moment. It's just the weirdest timing ever.\"\nBeattie said it was the players she felt for most and the impact it has on their cup final preparation.\n\"It's the timing for me, absolutely wild, five days before a cup final.\n\"I understand the decision making, but I do think the timing was really, really unfair on the players.\"\nBoth White and Beattie worked under Cushing in his previous spell at City and believe he is the right choice to take the club forward.\n\"He understands what Man City is about, he understands the club, the expectations and he is a figure that a lot of people will know,\" said White.\n\"I think he's got some great ideas. He's very diligent, he's very tactical, he's good at communication and he loves being on the grass. He's a very, very good coach.\"\nBeattie played under Cushing for four seasons at City and was part of the WSL-winning side in 2016 and won two FA Cups and two League Cups under him.\n\"In my experience under Nick, Nick had this unbelievable ability to make you focus on the task in hand and to be able to shut out the noise,\" she said.\n\"He will be able to take this chaotic time for the team, simplify it, and allow them to focus on the games.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.\nThe government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth. \nThe UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.\nIvy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.\nThe firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.\n\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"\nDr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet. \nIt doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.\nIn this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.\n\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me. \n\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"\nThe FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods. \nProf May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.\n\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"\nBut Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.\n\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.\n\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "Reflecting back on the Netflix hit based on his own life, there are two things that come to mind for Palestinian comedian Mo Amer.\nPride and hurt.\n\"It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\nHe is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.\nThe character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.\nMaking a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.\n\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.\nThere was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.\nThe final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.\nThat's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nThis triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nAvoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says. \nThe show is ultimately \"grounded in comedy\", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.\n\"You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,\" says Mo.\nMo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".\n\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.\nThere was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.\n\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.\n\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"\nThe show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.\nIt tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.\nFrom his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.\nMo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.\nThe West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.\nAlong with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what is widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nIsrael occupied the areas in the 1967 Middle East war and built settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.\nPalestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.\n\"I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,\" Mo says.\nHe adds it was \"not only Palestinians\" contacting him.\nMo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was \"almost like we filmed a movie\" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.\nHe says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.\n\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"\nMo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.\n\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.\n\"You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.\"\nMo says he can't \"walk away\" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling \"like public property at this point\".\n\"I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations. But I'm not going to shy away from it,\" he says.\n\"Those that agree with me or disagree with me\u2026 it's important to continue the dialogue and have a conversation.\"\nThe ceasefire agreement in Gaza has provided some hope that there could be an end to fighting, but it has also felt fragile with concern that deal could collapse.\nMo says he is \"always hopeful\" things can get better.\n\"I never lose hope. \n\"If you do, then it becomes a really, really sad place whenever you're devoid of hope,\" he says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma joined Paris St-Germain in 2021\nIt is the life of a goalkeeper. \nOne day you are the villain. The next, you are the hero.\nGianluigi Donnarumma was blamed by some for Paris St-Germain's defeat by Liverpool last week, allowing Harvey Elliot's 88th-minute effort - the Reds' only shot on target - to slip in. \nAt the other end, the Italian's opposite number Alisson produced the \"performance of his career\" as he single-handedly kept the French side at bay in Paris. \nOn Tuesday night, the tables turned.\nItaly's Donnarumma was the hero, saving two of Liverpool's three penalties in a shootout to send his side through to the Champions League quarter-finals. \n\"The first game belonged to Alisson, the second game belonged to Donnarumma,\" said PSG boss Luis Enrique.\nDonnarumma has now won six of the seven penalty shootouts he has taken part in for club and country.\nSince making his debut aged 16 for boyhood club AC Milan, Donnarumma has faced 60 penalties across his club and international career. \nHe has saved 14 of those, giving him a save percentage of 23.3%.\nRemarkably, the Italian's penalty shootout record is identical.\nThe 26-year-old has saved 10 of the 43 spot-kicks he has faced during shootouts - a save percentage of 23.3%.  \nDonnarumma, who was player of the tournament after Italy's 2021 Euros triumph, saved penalties from Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho in the final against England at Wembley. \nHis full record for penalties faced during matches and in shootouts is 24 saves from 103 penalties. \nDonnarumma missed Luis Enrique's pre-shootout team talk as he headed down the tunnel, choosing instead to retrieve some pre-prepared notes from the dressing room about Liverpool's spot-kicks.\n\"I had prepared something with my trainer, it was right to take something back to try to save some penalties,\" said Donnarumma. \n\"I see a lot of criticism from journalists without knowing what the goalkeeper's job is.\n\"In the first leg we conceded a shot and a goal, it seemed like it was my fault but I always think about smiling, giving my best and working for the team.\"\nAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma cuts an imposing figure.\nBut unlike many of his peers, he has a slightly different tactic for penalties.\nMany goalkeepers use the moments before a penalty is taken to attempt to 'get into the head' of the taker - slowing down the taking of the penalty, retrieving the ball for the taker or moving along their line. \nDonnarumma is different.\nLaidback and calm, the Italian barely moves until the player puts the ball on the spot. \nJust as they are readying their run-up, he expands his arms to make the goal look as small as possible. \n\"The idea behind that is to stand as slim as you can to start with,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told Football Daily.\n\"The ball goes on the spot, now you're putting doubt in their mind, you spread yourself, make yourself big and awkward, making the goal look smaller. \n\"You don't do that when they're walking forward. You do it when the ball is on the spot to put doubt in their mind in the last seconds.\" \nDonnarumma remained level-headed after both of his penalty saves, barely celebrating as he prepared for the next. \n\"I'm sat here watching Donnarumma and thinking, 'Wow, look at the size of him!'\" Warnock added.\n\"How imposing is he in that goal? If he dives the right way he stands a great chance of getting it. The guy's a monster.\" \nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "If a passenger dies on board a flight, cabin crew members like Jay Robert have to think fast.\n\"We go from service to lifesaving to mortician, dealing with dead bodies and then doing crowd control,\" the 40-year-old says. \"We're having to calculate: 'Okay, we still need to serve 300 people breakfast or dinner and we have to deal with this'.\"\nJay, a cabin manager for a major European airline and a former crew member for Emirates, has more than a decade's experience working on planes. Like all cabin crew, he has been trained to deal with passenger deaths, but has only experienced one himself.\nHe says deaths on planes are \"very uncommon\" and that people are more likely to die on longer flights because of the physical toll of being immobile for a long period. Some flight crew don't experience an on-board fatality during their entire career, he says.\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013 concluded that dying on a flight was \"rare\". The study, which looked at emergency calls from five airlines to a medical communications centre between January 2008 and October 2010, found that 0.3% of patients who had an in-flight medical emergency died.\nLast month, an Australian couple spoke about their \"traumatic\" experience of sitting next to a body on a plane from Melbourne to Doha after a woman died during the flight.\nMitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin said cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him. Qatar Airways said it followed appropriate guidelines and apologised for \"any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused\".\nBBC News has spoken to cabin crew and other aviation experts about how mid-air deaths are usually handled, what the rules are around storing corpses on planes and what it's like to work on a flight when someone has died.\nFlight crew themselves can't certify a death - this has to be done by medical personnel. Sometimes, this happens on the plane if there's someone qualified on board but more often, it is done upon landing. Most airlines follow the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) guidelines on what to do if a passenger has been presumed dead, though policies vary slightly by airline.\nIn a medical emergency, cabin crew would administer first aid and seek help from any passengers who were medical professionals, while the captain would use a telecommunications system to get instructions from emergency doctors on the ground, says Marco Chan, a former commercial pilot and a senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University. If necessary, the captain would divert the flight as soon as possible.\nBut it's not always possible to save a passenger.\nIf a passenger is presumed dead, the person's eyes should be closed and they should be placed in a body bag, if available, or otherwise, covered with a blanket up to the neck, according to the IATA guidelines.\nPlanes have very limited space, and it's a challenge to find a suitable spot to place the body without disturbing other passengers and compromising the plane's safety. Per the IATA, the body should be moved to a seat away from other passengers or to another area of the plane, if possible. But if the plane is full, they would usually be returned to their own seat.\nIn a narrow-body plane - those typically used for short-haul flights across the UK or within Europe - there isn't enough room on board \"to really shield a passenger from what has happened\", says Ivan Stevenson, associate professor in aviation management at Coventry University.\nSpace on these planes is \"very, very confined\", he says. \"If someone dies on board an aircraft like that, it's quite likely they will need to be placed in a seat.\"\nProf Stevenson acknowledges it's \"very unfortunate, very unpleasant\" but that crew have to put the plane's safety first.\nCrew will \"try to give some decency to the dead body\" by placing it on an empty aisle and using curtains, blankets and dim lights, Jay says, but they might not have much choice.\nThe body can't be placed in the galley in case it blocks an emergency exit. It also can't be left in the aisles in case there is an emergency evacuation, Jay says, or placed in the crew rest area on a long-haul flight. \nIt's also hard to physically manoeuvre a body in such a confined space, Jay says. This is what happened in the Qatar Airways case, when Mr Ring said the deceased passenger couldn't be carried down the aisle.\nA plane would divert to save a passenger's life in the event of a medical emergency - but it usually wouldn't if they were already presumed dead, aviation experts and cabin crew say. There's \"no point diverting\", Mr Chan says.\nThe captain would inform both the airline's operations centre and air traffic control of the passenger's death as soon as possible, and the plane would be met by local authorities, Prof Stevenson says. Either local authorities or a representative from the airline would contact the passenger's family if they were flying alone.\nAlly Murphy, who hosts the Red Eye Podcast where she interviews flight attendants, experienced one passenger death during a flight in her 14 years working as cabin crew.\nA male passenger who had been travelling alone from Accra, Ghana, to London passed out in his seat. After being alerted by the passenger in the seat next to him, the crew realised he wasn't breathing normally and didn't have a pulse.\nThe crew moved the man to the galley to perform CPR. \"You're kind of trapped in a tin can that's not designed for roaming around,\" Ally recalls. But there was more space than usual in the galley because the carts were out for meal service.\nAlly and another crew member performed CPR for 40 minutes without success. The captain then decided to divert the plane to Lyon, France, and though Ally and her colleague knew they should have strapped themselves in for landing, they continued performing CPR the whole time, she says.\n\"We didn't want to leave him.\"\nAfter landing, paramedics took the passenger away. He was declared dead, having suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm, Ally recalls.\n\"I held him in my arms for the final moments of his life,\" she says. \"He probably would have chosen someone else for that, but he got me.\"\nAfter the plane set off again following the diversion, the passengers were \"quite quiet and sombre,\" she says. But on arrival at their destination airport, one passenger from the flight started shouting at her because he missed his connecting flight. \n\"That's the one and only time that I've ever told a passenger where to go,\" she says.\nWitnessing a passenger dying was a traumatic experience for Ally.\n\"I went home and sat in the bath and I cried. I could taste the man's breath for about a week afterwards,\" she says. \"It was a little traumatising for a while. I couldn't watch anything with CPR for a long time.\"\nCabin crew are offered support after a passenger dies, including therapy and the option to have their rosters cleared for a few days so they can process what has happened, Jay says. \nAlly and her colleagues had a debrief with her airline after the passenger died where they were given \"reassurances that we did everything that we could\". Afterwards, she was able to schedule her shifts with a friend for a month because she felt \"a bit shell-shocked\".\nBecause cabin crew aren't used to passenger fatalities, it can be an especially harrowing experience when a passenger does die on board, Jay says.\n\"We are not doctors, we are not nurses,\" Jay says. \"While we are trained to deal with it, we don't face it every day, so we're not really immune to it.\"",

        "article_text": "Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024, has drawn global attention after the Trump administration arrested and moved to deport him.\nThe case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.\nMr Khalil will remain in detention in Louisiana following a court hearing on Wednesday, where lawyers argued over whether he should be moved back to New York.\nBorn in Syria, the Columbia graduate's arrest by immigration agents was linked to President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of \"un-American activity\". \nTrump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest \"the first of many to come\".\nThe 30-year-old's lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. They accused the government of \"open repression of student activism and political speech\".\nBorn in Syria to Palestinian refugees, Mr Khalil earned a degree in computer science from the Lebanese American University before working with the Syrian-American non-profit Jusoor. \nMore recently, he managed the Syria Chevening Programme for the British Embassy in Beirut, offering scholarships for study in the UK, according to his biography on the Society for International Development website.  \nThe UK Foreign Office said Mr Khalil stopped work there more than two years ago. \nMr Khalil moved to the US in 2022, where he earned a master's degree at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. He has since married an American woman, who is eight months pregnant, and initially faced arrest threats herself, according to his lawyer.\nMr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.\nActivists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.\nMr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.\nAfter Mr Khalil's arrest the Department of Homeland Security accused him of  \"leading activities aligned to Hamas\" but did not provide further details. \nOn Tuesday, the White House alleged that he had organised protests where pro-Hamas propaganda was distributed. His lawyers responded that there was no evidence that he had provided support of any kind to US-designated terror groups.\n\"They're trying to make an example of him to chill others from making similar speech,\" Samah Sisay told the AP.\nSome Jewish students at Columbia have said the protests veered into antisemitism and made them feel unsafe on campus. \nThe Columbia Jewish Alumni Association said Mr Khalil had \"spent over a year abusing the privileges this country and Columbia gave him\".\nThe Trump administration recently cut $400m in funding to the university over what it said was \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students\".\nStudents affiliated with Cuad and the protests have rejected these characterisations, and many Jewish students and groups participated in the campus rallies. \nColumbia was just one college campus that played host to mass student protests over the war in Gaza. And activists say they fear the Trump administration will continue to target protesters who are not US citizens.\nLegal experts say green card holders can be deported on national security grounds, but add that the case against Mr Khalil is unprecedented.\n\"Targeting individual protesters just for protesting... is highly unusual and something that we haven't seen before, even under the first Trump administration,\" said Jacob Hamburger, a visiting assistant professor at Cornell Law School.\nAmid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.\nAt the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa. \nIt is unclear when he obtained his green card, which provides permanent residency.\n\"[They said] that after reviewing the evidence, they don't have any evidence to suspend (me),\" he said in an interview in early May. \"It shows how random the suspension was \u2026 they did that randomly, and without due process.\"\nAt the time he said he would continue protesting, but more recently, Mr Khalil's wife said her husband had grown worried about deportation, after facing online attacks that \"were simply not based in reality\". She said he sent Columbia University an email asking for urgent legal help on 7 March, the day before immigration agents arrested him. \nMr Khalil's arrest has sparked demonstrations in New York City, where Columbia is located. On Monday, hundreds of people gathered at a Manhattan protest, including students and professors from Columbia University. \nDonna Lieberman, president of New York Civil Liberties Union, called the attempted deportation of Mr Khalil \"targeted retaliation and an extreme attack on the First Amendment\". New York Attorney General Letitia James said she was \"extremely concerned\".\nThe American Civil Liberties Union called the arrest \"unprecedented\" and \"obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate\"\n\"The federal government is claiming the authority to deport people with deep ties to the US and revoke their green cards for advocating positions that the government opposes,\" it said.\nThe White House has continued to defend its move.\n\"This administration is not going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in our country and then siding with pro-terrorist organisations that have killed Americans,\" said Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary.",

        "article_text": "An argument in the White House tore apart the US alliance with Ukraine, shook European leaders and highlighted JD Vance's key role in forcefully expressing Donald Trump's foreign policy. The vice-president has come out punching on the global stage - so what is it that drives his worldview?\nVance's first major foreign speech, at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, caught many by surprise.\nRather than focusing on the war raging in Ukraine, the US vice-president only briefly mentioned the bloodiest European conflict since World War Two.\nInstead, he used his debut on the international stage to berate close US allies about immigration and free speech, suggesting the European establishment was anti-democratic. He accused them of ignoring the wills of their people and questioned what shared values they were truly banding together with the US to defend.\n\"If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people,\" he warned.\nIt was a bold and perhaps unexpected way to introduce himself to the world - by angering European allies. But days later he was back in the news, at the centre of a blistering row with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of being ungrateful.\nFor those who have been studying the rise of Vance, these two episodes came as no surprise.\nThe vice-president has come to represent an intellectual wing of the conservative movement that gives expression to Trumpism and in particular how its America First mantra applies beyond its borders. In writings and interviews, Vance has expressed an ideology that seems to join the dots between American workers, global elites and the role of the US in the wider world.\nOn the campaign trail with Donald Trump last year, Vance spent much of his time sharply criticising Democrats - the usual attack-dog duties that traditionally get dished out to running mates - and sparring with reporters.\nAnd while Elon Musk's outsized and unconventional role in the Trump administration initially overshadowed him, that Munich speech and the Oval Office showdown have raised the profile of Trump's deputy.\nIt's also led to questions about the winding ideological journey he's made during his years in the conservative movement - and what he truly believes now.\n\"He's much more of a pragmatist than an ideologue,\" said James Orr, associate professor of philosophy of religion at the University of Cambridge and a friend whom Vance has described as his \"British sherpa\".\n\"He's able to articulate what is and is not in the American interest,\" Orr said. \"And the American interest is not the interest of some abstract utopia or matrix of propositions and ideas, but the American people.\"\nVance has repeatedly returned to this \"America First\" - or perhaps \"Americans First\" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.\nAt the Republican National Convention last summer, for example, he lamented how in small towns across the US \"jobs were sent overseas and children were sent to war\". And he attacked then-President Joe Biden, saying: \"For half a century, he's been a champion of every single policy initiative to make America weaker and poorer.\"\nBut Vance is also someone who, after a tough upbringing in an Ohio family with Appalachian roots and sudden fame on the back of a bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has tried out many different views.\nNot only is he a former \"Never Trumper\" who described the US president in 2016 as \"reprehensible\" and \"an idiot\", his book places much of the blame for the plight of the rural poor squarely on the choices made by individuals.\nMore recently he's shifted that blame to elites \u2013 a group he's variously defined as Democrats, conventional Republicans, liberals, corporate leaders, globalists and academics.\nIn speeches, Vance regularly argues that \"America is not just an idea\u2026 America is a nation.\"\nHe couples this statement with an anecdote about his family's ancestral graveyard in Kentucky, where he says he, his wife and their children will one day be buried, arguing that family and homeland are more important than some of America's traditional core ideas.\nIn Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.\nRod Dreher, a conservative American writer who is also a friend of the vice-president, said Vance's thinking arises from a belief that \"moderate normie Republicans\u2026 failed to offer anything to stop the so-called forever wars, and they also failed to offer anything to ordinary Americans like where he comes from, who are suffering economically from globalism and from the effects of mass migration and fentanyl\".\n\"He got red-pilled, so to speak, by Donald Trump,\" Dreher told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme this week.\n\"Red-pilled\" is internet slang for suddenly waking up to a supposedly hidden truth, as featured in The Matrix movies. It's commonly used by those on the right online who believe they have special access to reality and that people with liberal, centrist or establishment views are uncritical thinkers.\nVance is a vice-president who, more than his boss, seems extremely plugged into internet culture. He's an enthusiastic user of X, often jumping directly into arguments rather than using it, as many politicians do, as a platform for announcements.\nHis appearances on fringe right-wing podcasts, while he was trying to drum up support for a Senate run, provided fodder for his opponents, as did provocative trollish comments such as that the US was being run by \"childless cat ladies\".\nMarried to the daughter of Indian immigrants, he has rejected and been rejected by members of the alt-right even if he does echo some of their views. However, he does have friends and allies both at the top of Silicon Valley and in some of its lesser known corners.\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, he was brought into the world of venture capital by influential Silicon Valley conservative Peter Thiel, who later funded his US Senate campaign.\nHe has cited people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, a key guru in the \"neo-reactionary\" movement which dreams up fantasies of technologically-assisted, hyper-capitalist societies led by powerful monarchs.\nHis familiarity with the internet's fringes was further demonstrated when he spread false rumours about immigrants eating pets and an allegation about Ukrainian corruption - which the BBC traced back to Moscow.\n\"He sort of stews in this online world,\" said Cathy Young, a writer for the conservative, anti-Trump media outlet The Bulwark.\nAt the same time, Young said, his anecdote about family graveyards and homeland suggests another political tendency - a \"disturbing undertone of nativism\".\n\"That bothers some people and rightly so,\" she said. \"Part of the American legacy is that we are a nation of immigrants. [Former Republican President] Ronald Reagan talked about that, about one of the distinctive things about this country is that anyone can come here from any part of the world and become an American.\"\nVance's \"Americans First\" thinking clearly extends to the issue of the war in Ukraine. When he was a senator, he was often critical of America's involvement in the war and the huge sums spent on it, his former Senate colleague Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, recalled.\n\"His position then was very much like what it is now\u2026 that the conflict must end,\" Hawley told the BBC. \"It needs to end in a way that's maximally advantageous to the security of the United States and it needs to end in a way that gets our European allies to take increased responsibility.\"\nVance regularly accused the Biden administration of being more interested in Ukraine than in stemming illegal immigration. Writing in 2022, during his Senate campaign and after the Russian invasion, he said: \"I will be damned if I am going to prioritise Ukraine's eastern border right now when our own southern border is engulfed by a human tsunami of illegal migrants.\"\nHis views burst out into the open during that dramatic argument with President Zelensky in the Oval Office. Vance accused Zelensky of lacking respect, of sending politicians on a \"propaganda tour\" of Ukraine and of being insufficiently thankful for US aid.\n\"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,\" he told the Ukrainian president.\nThe argument left European leaders scrambling to defend Zelensky, while also trying to maintain negotiations over a possible peace deal.\nVance then prompted widespread outrage from allies when he poured scorn on the idea of security guarantees in the form of troops \"from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".\nHe later denied he was talking about the UK or France, the only two European countries that have publicly stated their willingness to send peacekeepers to Ukraine.\nBut the vice-president's willingness to step on the toes of allies reflect a world view which, in his words, has little time for \"moralisms about 'this country is good', 'this country is bad'\".\n\"That doesn't mean you have to have a complete moral blind spot, but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that you're dealing with, and there's a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country,\" he told a New York Times columnist last year.\nHis tone has shifted from the two years he spent in the US Senate before being picked by Trump. Democrat Cory Booker remembered Vance as \"very pragmatic and thoughtful\".\n\"That's why some of this stuff surprises me,\" Booker told the BBC.\nOthers detect the same disconnect.\nDavid Frum, now a writer for The Atlantic magazine, said that Vance's views have changed significantly from when he first commissioned the former marine, who was attending Ohio State University at the time, to write for his website on conservative politics more than 15 years ago.\n\"He was not in any way the culture warrior that he is today,\" Frum said.\nFrum, a former George W Bush speechwriter and staunch critic of Trump, said that Vance's view of Russia represented \"ideological admiration\".\nIn Munich, as he spoke about free speech, the vice-president cited cases involving conservatives and Christians in Western countries but avoided any mention of Russia's harsh clampdowns on expression.\nVance and his allies reject that he is sympathetic to Putin.\n\"I've never once argued that Putin is a kind and friendly person,\" Vance, then an Ohio senator, said in a speech at the 2024 Munich Security Conference.\n\"We don't have to agree with him. We can contest him and we often will contest him,\" he said. \"But the fact that he's a bad guy does not mean we can't engage in basic diplomacy and prioritising America's interests.\"\nThe BBC has asked the White House for comment on Vance's stance in relation to Ukraine and Russia.\nA quick end to the conflict in Ukraine is, in Vance's view, not only about putting a stop to billions of dollars being spent thousands of miles away.\nHe himself has said that there are bigger issues for the US and its friends to focus on than Ukraine, namely the threat of China, which he has called \"our most significant competitor... for the next 20 or 30 years\".\nVance's views on Ukraine and his willingness to publicly air them provided a dramatic moment in the early days of Trump's second presidential term.\nBut it also offered a vivid illustration of the vice-president's ideology, his prominence in the Trump administration and how he views America's place in the world.\nWith reporting by Rachel Looker and Anthony Zurcher in Washington and Lily Jamali in San Francisco\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "James Finlayson failed to make it as a lead man in Holywood but became one of the most memorable comic foils ever to grace the silver screen.\nThe Scottish actor performed in more than 100 films but was best known for being the \"third man\" to Laurel and Hardy. \nWith his distinctive fake moustache, he starred with the iconic duo in 33 of their films and later became the inspiration for Homer Simpson's \"D'oh!\" catchphrase.\nNow Finlayson has been memorialised with a new portrait in the Scottish theatre where he first tread the boards more than a century ago. \nDobbie Hall in his hometown of Larbert, Stirling, commissioned the oil painting to celebrate the actor's career and rise to international fame in the early days of cinema. \nThe portrait by young artist Connor Draycott was unveiled by Finlayson's family, some of whom had travelled from the US for the occasion.\nThey were joined by fans of the black and white movies and \"talkies\" from the UK chapters of Sons of the Desert, named after the fictional lodge that Laurel and Hardy belonged to in the 1933 film of the same name. \nFinlayson, known as Fin to his fans and as Jimmy to his good friend Stan Laurel, was born in Larbert in 1887.\nHe worked for a while as a tinsmith in his father's foundry before moving to Edinburgh to study and then pursue an acting career. \nAt the age of 23 he was performing at the Theatre Royal, but his ambitions were not satisfied. \nAfter the death of his parents he moved to New York with his brother.\nWithin the year he had landed a role on Broadway in The Great Game, for which reviews offered \"nothing but praise\". \nIn May 1912, the New York Dramatic Mirror said Finlayson had \"an excellent opportunity, which he did not miss, for developing two characters in his one role - the simple, naive Scotsman and the artful, determined detective\". \nIt added: \"The remarkable thing is that he managed to do them both at the same time.\"\nHe took on another Scottish character in the Broadway production of Bunty Pulls the Strings, but pulled out of the national tour in 1916 when Holywood beckoned. \nBy 1919 he was signed with the \"King of Comedy\" Mack Sennet, appearing as a Keystone Cop and lauded as a \"legitimate and screen player of international celebrity\".\nAfter a move to Hal Roach at Culver City in 1923, Finlayson was tested in different billings, sometimes in a lead role or as one of a comic trio with up-and-coming comics Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. \nHe eventually found his niche as their established comic support or antagonist. \nBy the time he died aged 66 in 1953, he had more than 100 film credits to his name and his eccentric mannerisms were internationally recognised. \nThe double-take, the squint then a one-eyed stare and raised eyebrow - Finlayson's madcap facial expressions became his trademark, along with the drawn-out \"dohhhh\".\nIt inspired Dan Castellaneta when he voiced Homer in The Simpsons, which first aired in 1989. \nIt is also said Finlayson's fake walrus moustache allowed him a degree of anonymity even in his heyday in Holywood. \nThe artist who created his new portrait said he toyed with the idea of picturing the actor without his famous facial hair. \nDraycott, who is studying fine art at Glasgow School of Art, was commissioned to produce the artwork by the Dobbie Hall Trust.\nIt wanted to commemorate the Larbert man's global success and inspire young performers who appear in shows at the theatre.\nDraycott, 20, said it was an honour to be asked to create the portrait for the theatre.\nAnd he revealed he spent hours watching Finlayson's films to \"recreate his trademark facial expression\". \nDraycott said: \"James is such a well-known face among fans of black and white movies and I wanted to capture the distinctive look that made him a real superstar of his day.\" \nThe award-winning artist said he was fascinated by Finlayson's look and story.\nHe added: \"There was initially some debate as to whether I should include his moustache in the portrait, as it was actually a false moustache that he wore specially for filming, but we decided that his moustache was such an integral part of his unique look that it should feature in the painting.\"\n\"I like the fact that despite his face being so well-known during the 19040s and 50's he could apparently remove the moustache and walk around Hollywood without being recognised by members of the public.\"\nBut now, thanks to his portrait, new generations in his hometown will recognise the young man from Larbert who followed his dream all the way to Holywood.",

        "article_text": "The Los Angeles District Attorney has announced his opposition to the resentencing of the notorious Menendez brothers, a move that could have paved the way for their freedom.\nDistrict Attorney Nathan Hochman's decision marks a departure from his predecessor who had sought to have the brothers resentenced and considered for parole. Both brothers are serving life sentences. \nLyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have long maintained that the murders were driven by years of sexual and physical abuse, rather than financial gain.\nHochman argued that the brothers' claims of self-defence was part of a litany of \"lies\".\nA California judge is set to consider the option of resentencing the brothers on 20 and 21 March.\nSpeaking at a news conference on Monday, Hochman outlined much of the criminal case, the defences the brothers had taken and the alleged lies he said they continued to stand by. \nHe said the brothers had not demonstrated true accountability, citing their continued insistence that the killings were an act of self-defence because they believed their parents were planning to kill them. \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" Hochman said, adding that their self-defence claim was \"fabricated.\"\nHochman's predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, had pushed to reduce the Menendez brothers' sentences to 50 years to life, which would have made them immediately eligible for parole. \nOn Monday, newly elected District Attorney Hochman moved to rescind that request, arguing the brothers' meticulously planned the murders and attempted to cover up the crime. \nIn his court filing, Hochman presented detailed evidence of the brothers' planning of the murders, contrasting sharply with Gasc\u00f3n's stance. \nGasc\u00f3n, known for his progressive approach to criminal justice, had argued the brothers had been rehabilitated during their three decades behind bars\u2014earning college degrees and establishing prison programs to aid fellow inmates.\nHochman suggested the brothers' resentencing request could only be reconsidered if they fully admitted to fabricating their self-defence claims. He said the Menendez brothers had \"acknowledged\" only four of 20 alleged lies they told about the case.\nHe emphasised how they repeatedly changed their account of events\u2014initially denying involvement and suggesting their parents were victims of a Mafia hit. The truth about their culpability emerged after Erik Menendez confessed to his therapist, whose recorded session was later handed over to law enforcement.\n\"They convinced, not just the media, not just the police, but their family and their friends that they were 100% innocent of these crimes, until eventually these tapes came out,\" Hochman said.\nThe resentencing bid is one of three avenues the Menendez brothers have been working on in hopes of gaining their freedom. \nThey've asked for a new trial but Hochman has said his office will oppose the request. \nThe brothers have also asked California Governor Gavin Newsom for clemency, which could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon. \nNewsom has ordered the parole board to conduct a risk assessment to examine whether the brothers are a danger to society - one step in a broader process that could lead to clemency. \nMuch of the Menendez family has been pushing for the brothers to be released, holding news conferences, appearing at court hearings and meeting with prosecutors in the case. \nBut after meeting Hochman about the case, one family member accused the new district attorney of  a \"hostile, dismissive and patronizing tone\" in a complaint filed with the state's department of corrections and rehabilitation, US media reported. \nTamara Goodell, a cousin of the brothers, said in the complaint that Hochman violated her rights as a victim and accused him of having a bias against Erik and Lyle Menendez. \nAt least one member of the family has publicly come out against the bids for their freedom. \nA lawyer for Kitty Menendez's brother, Milton Andersen, has called the killings \"cold-blooded\" and said the murders \"shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades.\"\nMr Andersen has said he believes his nephews should stay in prison for their \"heinous act\", said the lawyer, Kathy Cady.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the \"anti-Trump\" on the US president's doorstep.\nThe former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought \"dark days\" from \"a country we can no longer trust\" and that he was \"proud\" of Canadians resisting the US \"with their wallets\".\nWhile on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs \"until Americans show us respect\", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking. \nTrump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. \"The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our country\u2026 Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,\" he said.\nBehind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to \"stand up to a bully\". \nHe ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused \"entirely\" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and \"perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back\".\nHe follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over.\nCarney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic. \nHe has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund. \nCarney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said \"good luck with that\". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's \"southern neighbour\".\nThe Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June.\nHis rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely.  \nOn the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards \"more reliable\" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US.\nThe bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system. He says Canada can \"stand on its own feet\" but sees merit in creating a more coherent international alliance to focus the minds of Congress and tariff-sceptics in the Trump administration.\nCanada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear. Canada and the UK should be on the same side in this new world era.",

        "article_text": "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.\nIt was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.\nThen Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.\nShe was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.\n\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"\nThe firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.\nSince returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.\nThe president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.\nBut the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.\nGoods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher. \n\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.\n\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"\nBusinesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.\nMeanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.\nWhile many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise. \nAt the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.\n\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.\n\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"\nResearch suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.\nIn February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.\nMs Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.\n\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"\nDuring Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.\nInsiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.\nFears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.  \nFor the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute. \nHe plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.  \nThere is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.\nMs Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.\nShe hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.\n\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"  ",

US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs11 hours agoShareSaveDaniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesAlmost 80% of smartphones sold in the US are made in China Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.Getty ImagesChina remains the centre of global tech manufacturingMs Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time.",

        "article_text": "On his 18th birthday, Raphinha sat alone in his tiny room in Florianopolis, staring at his phone. No messages. No calls. No offers. Injured and out of the Avai U20 team, he was on the verge of giving up. \nFootball had been his escape from the favelas of Brazil's Porto Alegre, but now it felt like a dead end. His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nHe again showed his worth in Tuesday's last-16 second leg against Benfica, scoring twice to help send Barca through to the quarter-finals.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out. \nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles. \nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football. \nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of \u00a350m, potentially rising to \u00a355 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club. \nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\n\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 26 goals and 19 assists in 40 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal, who also played a starring role in Tuesday's win over Benfica, has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football. \nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training. It is this discipline that has been key to raising him to his physical and mental peak.\nAnd now he has reached this point, there is no stopping him and if Barcelona go far in the Champions League, nobody should argue his right to be considered one of the top players in the world.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "A lack of this vital nutrient is one of the world's leading causes of disability \u2013 but exactly when it becomes a problem, and the best way to treat it, remains unclear.\nWhen Megan Ryan first noticed her fatigue, she assumed it was normal. After all, she was a single parent to a three-year-old.\u00a0She also worked full-time. Almost every day, when she picked her son up from daycare, she'd fall asleep with him during his afternoon nap. She didn't think much about it. \"I just thought, 'Oh, this is motherhood',\" says Ryan, who lives in upstate New York, US. At a routine medical check-up in June 2023, her doctor asked if she felt exhausted. Blood test results showed that Ryan had iron deficiency anaemia.\nLooking back, there had been other signs. Despite regularly working out, Ryan had suddenly started to feel winded on routine hikes. She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. That time, her midwife suspected it after Ryan mentioned that her only pregnancy craving was ice \u2013 a classic sign of pica, which is, in turn, a symptom of iron deficiency.\u00a0\nIron deficiency is the\u00a0most common micronutrient deficiency in the world today, affecting roughly two billion people. It is especially prevalent among children as well as women of reproductive age, including pregnant women.\nThe condition can cause a wide range of consequences. When a pregnant woman doesn't have adequate iron stores, for example, it can affect the foetus' brain development and there is also a higher risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, dying during pregnancy and stillbirth. For babies and toddlers, not having enough iron can affect long-term development, with studies finding that children are at risk\u00a0of exhibiting behavioural issues \u2013 they are less happy and contented, and tend to be more socially inhibited. It can also influence children's motor skills, and cognitive ability even years after a deficiency has been corrected. In adults, iron deficiency is one of the world's leading causes of disability. In rare cases, it can be life-threatening.\n\"It's a major global problem,\" says Michael Zimmermann, professor\u00a0of human nutrition at the University of Oxford in the UK and a long-time researcher of micronutrient deficiencies. \"It's very common. It's not going away very fast. And it is associated with a lot of disability.\"\nMost scientists agree that iron deficiency is a common condition. But other questions persist, such as how exactly to define iron deficiency, or how likely it is, in the absence of other symptoms, to raise the risk of poor health outcomes. So, when should, and shouldn't, someone supplement their iron?\u00a0\nWhat isn't disputed is that some groups are more susceptible to iron deficiency than others.\nIn women, for example, iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 where the body does not have enough iron to make sufficient red blood cells \u2013 is a leading cause of disability worldwide. One study of first-time US blood donors found that iron levels were low in 12% of women, but in less than 3% of men, reflecting the impact made by regular blood loss through menstruation. Then there's the impact of pregnancy, which diverts nutrition to the foetus, meaning that women in this group are particularly at risk. One study found that 46% of UK women had anaemia at some point during pregnancy \u2013 though not all cases stemmed from iron deficiency.\nEndurance athletics, vegetarianism or veganism and frequent blood donation can all put both men and women at increased risk. People with certain health conditions might also be prone to lower iron levels. Kidney disease and coeliac disease can decrease iron absorption, for example.\nBut children are among the most vulnerable group to iron deficiency because the mineral is so important for their development.\n\"What's the most rapid period of growth in our entire lifespan? Infancy,\" says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \"You triple your birth weight by a year of age. You double your length.\" As our bodies grow, they need more blood. And red blood cells are built \u2013 in part \u2013 on iron. Without that necessary iron, says Corkins, you risk not able to produce enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your growing tissues, including the brain.\nIron deficiency is especially common in children from lower income countries. \"In studies I've done in Africa, 70% of babies between six and 12 months of age have clear iron-deficiency anaemia,\" says Zimmermann.\nEven in wealthier countries, which have better overall nutrition and which are more likely to fortify certain food products with iron, this deficiency persists. Up to 4% of toddlers in the US, for example, have iron-deficiency anaemia, while some 15% have iron deficiency.\nIron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, and anaemia\nAnaemia occurs when someone is not producing enough normal red blood cells or haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen around in your blood. While this can be due to various factors, around half of all anaemia cases are caused by iron deficiency. Adults with this condition, iron-deficiency anaemia, might experience weakness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath, among other symptoms. Symptoms in babies and small children are similar, though they might also have sleep issues \u2013 particularly frequent night wakes, restlessness during sleep, and difficulty falling asleep.\nJust because someone is iron deficient does not necessarily mean they will have anaemia. \"Iron deficiency can be considered a stage prior to anaemia,\" says clinical haemotologist Sant-Rayn Pasricha, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health who specialises in iron deficiency and related conditions.\nThe severity of the deficiency plays a key role, Pasricha explains. When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently, he says. They get smaller and, eventually, the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in that person's blood drops below a healthy level. \"That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia,\" Pasricha says.\nIron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a blood test \u2013 usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or haemoglobin.\nSome specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern \u2013 especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.\nPasricha co-authored a review to help inform the World Health Organization's guidelines on iron supplementation in women. In that research, he found something interesting.\u00a0\nWhile those women in clinical trials who were iron deficient and reported feeling fatigued found that their fatigue improved upon taking iron supplements, the intervention didn't change the energy levels of women who were also iron deficient, but who had not reported fatigue.\u00a0\n\"This hints to us that, at least in adults, if you're clinically unwell with an iron deficiency, then of course you should be treated and that will improve how you feel,\" Pasricha says. \"But it also suggests that, if you're feeling perfectly fine, and someone just finds that you have a low iron level \u2013 then it's hard to be sure that that treating you then would boost you to feel any different.\"\nOverall, iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia has been studied less than iron-deficiency anaemia. But there are some broad conclusions we can make, researchers say.\n\"The consensus is that iron-deficiency anaemia is certainly worse,\" says Zimmermann. \"But iron deficiency is also associated with impairment.\"\nAccording to some studies, the effects of iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 particularly in children \u2013 can be long-lasting. \"It's not just about [poor health outcomes] \u2013 it is that you didn't maximise your development,\" Corkins says.\nOne review, for example, found a \"consistent association\" between children with iron-deficiency anaemia having poorer cognitive performance compared to controls. However, the researchers note, perhaps it's not iron-deficiency anaemia that's the problem. It could be the effect of anaemia in general, which depresses energy levels. The researchers also say in their review that it is hard to rule out the influence of socioeconomic factors on children\u2019s behaviour and cognition.\nThis complexity lies at the heart of all nutrition research: is it the absence of a nutrient itself that's the problem, or is that deficiency a sign of something else going on?\nTo complicate matters further, the criteria for defining iron deficiency in children is still up for debate, says Zimmermann. Because children are growing so fast, he adds, iron deficiency normally quickly leads to anaemia \u2013 which means it's not easy to find, and study, iron-deficient children who are not anaemic.\nGiven that, and the potential consequences for their development, guidelines often advise supplementing children with iron at any sign of deficiency \u2013 or even to supplement as a prevention measure.\u00a0\nIn the US, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed receive iron drops from four months old, for example. This is because breastmilk has low levels of iron, while formula milk is usually fortified.\nBut some researchers question this approach.\nPasricha was involved in the largest trial to date that has examined the effect of supplementation on child development, he says. The study, of 3,300 eight-month-old babies in Bangladesh, randomised children into groups that received either daily iron supplementation for three months, or a placebo. He and colleagues measured the children's neurodevelopment before and after the supplementation. \"We did not see any evidence of a functional benefit,\" he says, although they also saw no harm either way.\n\"We did see that haemoglobin and iron status did improve in the children that received iron \u2013 but we didn't see that affect child development,\" says Pasricha. The \"why\", he says, \"is something that the team is really grappling with\".\nOther research has yielded similar findings. For example, in one study, even after infants with iron-deficiency anaemia received supplementation that corrected their anaemia, they continued to show more restless sleep patterns than their cohorts \u2013 sometimes even years later.\nOne possible reason might be that even a brief period of deficiency can lead to long-lasting harm. One study, for example, found that when children had had iron deficiency at birth, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old \u2013 even if their iron levels had been corrected.\u00a0\nBut another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else \u2013 such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.\nMeanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. Some studies have found that babies and toddlers who had adequate iron levels, but received supplementation, had poorer weight gain and less growth compared to controls. Randomised controlled trials have found that babies randomly assigned to high-iron formula milk scored more poorly on cognitive tests of abilities like visual memory, reading comprehension and mathematics at both 10 years old and 16 years old, compared to those on a low-iron formulation. However, exactly how much iron supplementation would avoid these effects remains unclear, the researchers say as other factors could also be involved.\nGiven results like this, however, some experts have criticised US guidelines to supplement all breastfed infants.\nSupplements can also have other side effects. Zimmermann, for example, has studied how supplementation can affect people's microbiome. Bacteria thrive on iron, he says. The very small amount of iron that breastmilk has is bound to protective substances like lactoferrin, which helps to keep iron away from potential pathogens in the gut \u2013 especially protective for babies, who have immature immune systems. Giving a baby aged six months old micronutrient powders containing iron, which is what many experts recommend, could result in a negative outcome, says Zimmermann.\n\"These powders have very high amounts of iron in them\u2026 which can cause a very rapid shift in the microbiome,\" says Zimmermann. The babies can't absorb all that iron, which ends up impacting their gut microbiome \u2013 potentially towards a balance favouring \"the pathogens we worry most about in babies\", he says. This includes E. coli, which grows prolifically in the presence of iron.\nMany clinicians and researchers agree, however, that when someone has iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia along with symptoms, supplementing can be one of the fastest ways to help them improve. One review of iron deficiency in endurance athletes, for example, found that supplementation not only improved ferritin and haemoglobin, but athletes' aerobic capacity, too.\u00a0\nWhether to take supplements \u2013 or give them to a child \u2013 is something that people should decide with the help of a doctor, experts say.\nBut in an ideal world, people would get sufficient iron by eating a balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods, and avoid developing a deficiency in the first place \u2013 though this is not always possible. Ingredients such as liver or red meat, pulses, including kidney and edamame beans and chickpeas, as well as nuts and dried fruits are all considered good sources of iron.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants aged six to 12 months need 11 mg of iron per day. For toddlers, they recommend 7 mg, and for four- to eight-year-olds, 10 mg.\nPart of the higher recommendation for younger babies is because of their rapid development, experts say. But it's also because there is an assumption being made that most infants' first solids will be foods like iron-fortified cereals, as well as fruits and vegetables \u2013 non-heme sources of iron, which the body absorbs less readily than heme sources, which are animal-derived, like meat, fish and eggs.\n\"Diet is the best approach. Your body tends to take it up better. Your body tends to use it better,\" Corkins says. \"Now, if someone is profoundly anaemic, and you're trying to get them fixed faster \u2013 then you do supplementation.\"\nAs for Ryan, she was able to correct her iron deficiency both times it happened: in pregnancy, with a supplement, and in 2023, with iron infusions, administered at her hospital, every two weeks for five months. \"It wasn't a quick fix,\" she says. With time, however, she noticed her fatigue fade.\nDisclaimer\n All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of a doctor or any other health care professional.

        "summary": "She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. What isn't disputed is that some groups are more susceptible to iron deficiency than others.When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently \u2013 Sant-Rayn PasrichaIn women, for example, iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 where the body does not have enough iron to make sufficient red blood cells \u2013 is a leading cause of disability worldwide. \"That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia,\" Pasricha says.Iron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a blood test \u2013 usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or haemoglobin.A matter of debateSome specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern \u2013 especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.Pasricha co-authored a review to help inform the World Health Organization's guidelines on iron supplementation in women. But another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else \u2013 such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.Meanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. One study, for example, found that when children had had iron deficiency at birth, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old \u2013 even if their iron levels had been corrected.",

        "article_text": "Residents of Greenland are going to the polls on Tuesday in a vote that in previous years has drawn little outside attention - but which may prove pivotal for the Arctic territory's future.\nUS President Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has put it firmly in the spotlight and fuelled the longstanding debate on the island's future ties with Copenhagen.\n\"There's never been a spotlight like this on Greenland before,\" says Nauja Bianco, a Danish-Greenlandic policy expert on the Arctic.\nGreenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen.\nNow, five out of six parties on the ballot favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.\nThe debate over independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\nThe island's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught the US president's eye. He first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in 2019.\nSince taking office again in January, he has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory. Greenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands.\nAddressing the US Congress last week, however, Trump again doubled down. \"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,\" he said, prompting applause and laughter from a number of politicians, including Vice-President JD Vance.\nIn Nuuk, his words struck a nerve with politicians who were quick to condemn them. \"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" Prime Minister Mute Egede said.\nStill, the US interest has stoked calls for Greenland to break away from Denmark, with much of the debate focused on when \u2013 not if \u2013 the process of independence should begin.\nGreenland's independence goal is not new, Nauja Bianco points out, and has been decades in the making.\nA string of revelations about past mistreatment of Inuit people by the Danes have hurt Greenlandic public opinion about Denmark. Earlier this year, PM Egede said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\".\nBut it is the first time the subject has taken centre stage in an election.\nInuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of Prime Minister Mute Egede, favours gradual steps towards autonomy. \"Citizens must feel secure,\" he told local media.\nArctic expert Martin Breum says Egede's handling of the challenge from Trump and strong words against Denmark over past colonial wrongdoings \"will give him a lot of votes\".\nSmaller rivals could also gain ground and potentially shake up alliances.\nOpposition party Naleraq wants to immediately kick-off divorce proceedings from Copenhagen and have closer defence dealings with Washington.\nPointing to Greenland's EU departure and Brexit, party leader Pele Broberg has said that Greenland could be \"out of the Danish kingdom in three years\".\nNaleraq is fielding the largest number of candidates and has gained momentum by riding the wave of discontent with Denmark.\n\"Naleraq will also be a larger factor too in parliament,\" predicts Mr Breum, who says party candidates have performed well on TV and on social media.\nHowever, the centre-right Demokraatit party believes it is too soon to push for independence.\n\"The economy will have to be much stronger than it is today,\" party candidate Justus Hansen told Reuters.\nGreenland's economy is driven by fishing, and government spending relies on annual subsidies from Denmark.\nTalk of Trump and independence has overshadowed other key issues for voters, says newspaper editor Masaana Egede.\n\"It's an election where we should be talking about healthcare, care of the elderly and social problems. Almost everything is about independence.\"\nAccording to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back moves towards future statehood.\nAbout 44,000 people are eligible to vote, and given the low numbers and few polls, results are difficult to forecast. \nEven though a majority of Greenlanders favour independence, a survey has shown that half would be less enthusiastic about independence if that meant lower living standards.\nOne poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish to become a part of the United States, and nearly half see Trump's interest as a threat.\nOne fear among some Greenlanders, says Masaana Egede, is how long the Arctic island could remain independent and whether it would break off from Denmark only to have another country \"standing on our coasts and start taking over\".\nExperts say it is this worry that could steer votes towards keeping the status quo.\nAlthough Greenland's right to self-determination is enshrined into law by the 2009 Self-Rule Act, there are several steps to take before the territory could break away from Denmark, including holding a referendum.\nThis means getting full independence could take \"about 10 to 15 years,\" says Kaj Kleist, a veteran Greenlandic politician and civil servant who prepared the Self-Rule Act.\n\"There is lot of preparation and negotiations with the Danish government before you can make that a reality,\" he adds.\nWhatever the election's outcome, experts do not believe Greenland could become independent before Trump's second term is over in 2028.\nThe results are expected in the early hours of Wednesday.",

        "article_text": "Native Americans, English sailors and pirates all came together on Ocracoke Island in North Carolina to create the only American dialect that is not identified as American.\nI'd never been called a \"dingbatter\" until I went to Ocracoke, North Carolina for the first time. I've spent a good part of my life in the state, but I'm still learning how to speak the\u00a0Hoi Toider\u00a0brogue. The people here just have their own way of speaking: it's like someone took Elizabethan English, sprinkled in some Irish tones and 1700s Scottish accents, then mixed it all up with pirate slang. But the Hoi Toider dialect is more than a dialect. It's also a culture, one that's slowly fading away. With each generation, fewer people play meehonkey, cook the traditional foods or know what it is to be \"mommucked\".\nIn an effort to put his \"America first\" stamp on the nation's speech, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order making English the country's official language. It marks the first time in the US's nearly 250-year history that the nation has had an official language. Yet, on this small 9.6-square-mile island surrounded by the swirling waters of the Atlantic, residents still speak what is arguably the most English version of English in the country \u2013 and many Americans don't understand it.\nAs the island's official website proudly proclaims: \"With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets.\"\nLocated 20 miles from the North Carolina mainland, Ocracoke Island is fairly isolated. You can't drive there as there are no bridges, and most people can\u2019t fly either as there are no commercial flights. If you want to go there, it has to be by boat. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, that meant Ocracoke was a perfect spot for pirates to hide, as no soldiers were going to search 16 miles of remote beaches and forests for wanted men.\nWilliam Howard was one of those outlaws, serving as quartermaster on Blackbeard\u2019s ship Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge. Leaving before Blackbeard\u2019s final battle in 1718, Howard made his way to Virginia, eventually taking the general pardon offered by King George I to all pirates. But unlike some, Howard had a plan. For several decades, he dropped out of sight, only to reappear in 1759 when he bought Ocracoke Island for \u00a3105 from a man named Richard Sanderson, a justice and later a General Assembly member in mainland North Carolina.\nHoward settled down along with some other ex-pirates and started building a community with boat pilots who had been stationed on the island to help guide merchant ships around sandbars in the area. A mainland North Carolina Native American tribe also interacted with the early settlers. The Woccon tribe had set up fishing and hunting outposts on the island, which they called Woccocock. Through misspellings and mispronunciations, it became Wokokon, Oakacock and Okercock, before finally arriving at the current version of Ocracoke in the mid-1700s. So at this point, there were Native Americans, English sailors and pirates from a variety of places all in one location. And that isolated community of just under 200 started blending words and dialects, and eventually building its own way of speaking. \u00a0\n\"It's the only American dialect that is not identified as American,\" said Dr Walt Wolfram, a North Carolina State University professor who studied the Ocracoke dialect for more than 20 years and currently works as the director of NC State\u2019s Language and Life Project. \"That's fascinating to me. You can find pronunciation, grammar structures and vocabulary on Ocracoke that are not found anywhere else in North America.\"\nHoward's community lived in near-isolation for almost two centuries. Electricity didn't arrive at the island until 1938 and a ferry service didn't start until 1957, leaving the islanders cut off except for the occasional supply trip to the mainland. Even today, things are a bit different for the island's 676 residents than on mainland North Carolina.\n\"You have to be a certain type of individual to enjoy living here,\" said Chip Stevens, an island resident directly descended from Howard and the former owner of the local hotel Blackbeard's Lodge. \"There isn't a Lowes or a Harris Teeter or any [supermarkets]. Rarely does anyone go off the island without a cooler [to bring back supplies]. You have to be almost a holistic person, capable of dealing with less of a hectic nightlife lifestyle.\"\nYes, mobile phones and laptops still work here, and if you want to sit down and watch some Major League Baseball in a pub, there are plenty of options. But in many other ways, the island is a throwback to a time before internet and television. Instead of cinemas, there are outdoor theatre groups. Local teashops, spice markets and other family-owned stores take the place of chain supermarkets. Cars are allowed on the 16 mile-long island, but most people just park them and walk everywhere. The island's children all attend one school, while residents work as everything from fishermen to brewery owners to woodworkers.\n\"It's amazing how coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country,\" Stevens said, sitting on the hotel's front porch. \"You feel that separation. It's a really nice feeling, being able to give your kids some freedom. When I was a kid, we'd leave [home] after breakfast, eat lunch at somebody else's house, walk to the beach, take a rowboat out in the water, and our parents never had to worry about us. We've maintained a lot of that.\"\nAnd they've still \u2013 just \u2013 maintained their unique way of speaking.\nWhen older Ocracoke natives, or \"O'cockers\" as they call themselves, speak, the \"I\" sound is an \"oi\", so they say \"hoi\" instead of \"high\". That's where the Hoi Toider name comes from: it's based on how the O'cockers say \"high tide\".\nThen there are the phrases and vocabulary, many of which are also kept over from the original British and Irish settlers. For example, when you're on Ocracoke, someone might \"mommuck a buck before going up the beach\", which means \"to tease a friend before going off the island\".\n\"We have a lot of words that have been morphed to make our own,\" said Amy Howard, another of William Howard's descendants, who runs the Village Craftsmen, a local arts and crafts store. \"[Hoi Toider] is a combination from a whole blend of cultures. A lot of the early settlers were well travelled, so they ran into lots of different types of people. For example, the word \"pizer\" we use comes from [a European] word which means porch. So if you're going to be sitting on your pizer, you're sitting on your porch.\"\nThere's a long list of words in Ocracoke vocabulary that are taken from countries across the globe. \"Quamish\", for example, means sick or nauseated. It comes from the 16th-Century English word \"qualm\". Then there's \"buck\", which means a male friend. You can trace that back to 13th-Century Germany, where it originally meant a male deer, as it does in most English-speaking places today.\nLocals even made up words in some cases. For example, early settler children played a game of hide and seek called meehonkey. Everyone would hide and call out \"meehonkey\" while one person tried to find them. According to island tradition, Amy told me, the kids believed meehonkey was the sound a goose made as it flew by. Then there's \"dingbatter\", which is used for anyone who isn\u2019t a native.\nBut with each generation, the dialect is starting to disappear. The world is coming to the island through television and the internet, as well as with the long line of tourists who show up every summer. There's also more people from the mainland moving in.\n\"What's happening is that some of these small dialects that thrive on isolation are dying because isolation is a thing of the past,\" said Dr Wolfram. \"They still pick up terms and vocabulary, but when a kid from the island retains a strong dialect, that was the norm and now it\u2019s an exception.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Alabama musuem grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022\u00a0How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n\u2022\u00a0The only land disputed between the US and Canada\nIn the past, kids adopted the dialect because that was the only version they heard. Now there are hundreds of dialects and languages that most will encounter before they graduate high school. In fact, as of 2024, on this island of 676 people, fewer than half actually speak with the full Hoi Toider brogue.\n\"Within one to two generations, it'll be gone,\" said Dr Wolfram. \"It's dying out and we can\u2019t stop that.\"\nYet while the dialect may be in danger, the islanders are managing to hold onto their unique culture in other ways. In the beginning, settlers often had to come up with alternatives when they didn't have the right ingredients for a recipe. That same concept holds true today: with limited stores on the island, if you run out of supplies, you can either head to the mainland for what you need or just find a replacement.\n\"Ocracoke is really good at adapting,\" said Amy. \"I joke that we need to make a cookbook for Ocracoke that says what the recipe is and then what you can actually get, because almost inevitably, you get a quirky recipe and you won\u2019t have everything you need.\"\nThat's actually how the fig cake, which is now Ocracoke's signature dish, came to be. The story goes that in 1964, island resident Margaret Garrish was making a date cake and she had all the ingredients mixed in, except one.\n\"She found she didn't have any [dates], so she did what we all do and looked in her cupboard and found a jar of fig preserves,\" Amy said, explaining that figs are a holdover from the original settlers, and you can find fig trees in almost every yard. \"She threw them in the cake, mixed them up and now we have fig cakes.\"\nNow every year in August, the island holds a Fig Festival, complete with a fig cake bake-off, fig tastings, a square dance and traditional games like meehonkey.\nBut while some traditions stand strong, residents do see the island changing.\nNew York native Daphne Bennink\u00a0came to the island 35 years ago and never left. For her, the change, in some ways, reflects the same wealth of experience those original settlers brought.\n\"I see more and more people coming here,\" Bennink said. \"On Ocracoke, you have this kind of patchwork quilt of all people from all walks. It\u2019s a little bit of a melting pot.\"\nAs for what type of culture that melting pot will create? Everyone I talked to pretty much said the same thing: no matter what changes, some things will stay the same on Ocracoke. If someone is sick, the community will pitch in. If one business owner needs help, 14 others will show up to solve the problem.

        "article_text": "Oval Invincibles and London Spirit were the men's and women's champions in The Hundred in 2024\nThe Hundred draft takes place on Wednesday before the fifth edition of the tournament this summer.\nWith a host of big-name players up for grabs, the 16 teams - eight men's and eight women's - will be looking for the additions to give themselves the best chance of lifting the trophy at Lord's on 31 August.\nBBC Sport and data analysts CricViz look at how the squads are shaping up, what each team needs and who they may target.\nRehan Ahmed took 11 wickets over three seasons with Southern Brave\nCurrent squad: Liam Livingstone, Ben Duckett, Trent Boult (overseas), Jacob Bethell, Benny Howell, Adam Milne (o), Dan Mousley, Tim Southee (o), Will Smeed, Chris Wood, Aneurin Donald.\nWhat do they need? The best player available. With established openers (Duckett and Smeed), a flurry of all-rounders (Livingstone, Bethell, Mousley, Howell) and their Kiwi pace trio (Boult, Milne, Southee), Phoenix can be flexible with their selection and pick who they think is the best player available at the time.\nRehan Ahmed could give Phoenix a specialist leg-spin option to complement their army of finger-spinning all-rounders.\nCurrent squad: Jamie Smith, Liam Dawson, Daniel Worrall, Kane Williamson (o), Richard Gleeson, Olly Stone, Ollie Pope, Keaton Jennings.\nWhat do they need? An explosive all-rounder.\nGiven a slow-ish scoring top four of Jennings, Smith, Williamson and Pope and tricky six-hitting conditions at Lord's at the end of innings, Jamie Overton could fit the bill. \nHe has a strike-rate of 167 in the last 25 balls of Hundred matches. He also clocks 87mph when fit and is an exceptional fielder. Spirit have the first pick in the men's draft.\nNoor Ahmad was part of the Afghanistan squad at the Champions Trophy\nCurrent squad: Jos Buttler, Phil Salt, Heinrich Klaasen (o), Matthew Hurst, Scott Currie, Josh Tongue, Tom Hartley, Sonny Baker, Tom Aspinwall.\nWhat do they need? A wicket-taking spinner. The Originals only picked up 31 wickets across eight games last season, the joint lowest for any side.\nLeft-arm wrist-spinner Noor Ahmad took 13 wickets at 17.5 in the recent SA20 with an economy of 6.90.\nThe 2.5\u00b0 average turn at Old Trafford in the last two Hundred seasons is the second highest in the competition, which would help him. Given the Originals' new owners RP Sanjiv Goenka Group also own Durban Super Giants - Ahmad's SA20 side - it would be no surprise to see the Afghanistan international head to Manchester.\nCurrent squad: Harry Brook, Adil Rashid, David Miller (o), Mitchell Santner (o), Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts, Ben Dwarshuis (o), Graham Clark, Pat Brown, Tom Lawes.\nWhat do they need? A top order run-scorer. Nicholas Pooran (fourth with 227 runs) was the only Supercharger in the top 10 run-scorers last season. Their top three batters collectively average 18.9 (only Spirit were worse in 2024).\nDespite tricky conditions at Lord's, Dan Lawrence has averaged 24 in Hundred games there while striking at 147. He'll be even more suited to the flat pitches of Headingley and provides a back-up captaincy option to Brook.\nLhuan-dre Pretorius scored 397 runs for Paarl Royals in the SA20\nCurrent squad: Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Tom Curran, Jordan Cox, Rashid Khan (o), Saqib Mahmood, Sam Billings, Gus Atkinson, Nathan Sowter, Donovan Ferreira (o), Tawanda Muyeye.\nWhat do they need? A left-handed opener. Having retained most of their back-to-back title winning squad, with the exception of Dawid Malan, they'll be looking for a good value overseas option in the middle rounds of the draft.\nEighteen-year-old Lhuan-dre Pretorius lit up the SA20 in January, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the competition with 397 runs at an average of 33 and a strike rate of 166.\nCurrent squad: James Vince, Jofra Archer, Tymal Mills, Chris Jordan, Faf du Plessis (o), Leus Du Plooy, Craig Overton, Laurie Evans, Finn Allen (o), Danny Briggs, James Coles.\nWhat do they need? Lower-order power. Established top-order batters Du Plessis and Vince should do the bulk of the run scoring but the squad is missing a big hitter to clear the ropes at number six.\nKieron Pollard, who memorably hit Rashid Khan for five sixes to win Southern Brave a match last year, could return. He boasts a six every nine deliveries he faces in Hundred cricket.\nHis availability is a slight issue with the Caribbean Premier League starting in mid-August, but he can be replaced.\nSunil Narine has starred in franchise leagues around the world for the past decade\nCurrent squad: Joe Root, Marcus Stoinis (o), Tom Banton, John Turner, Sam Cook, Sam Hain, Tom Alsop, Calvin Harrison.\nWhat do they need? Mystery spin. Rashid Khan has left for Oval Invincibles and Andy Flower's side have always had an overseas spinner in their ranks (Rashid, Chris Green, Ish Sodhi, Tabraiz Shamsi, Imad Wasim).\nSunil Narine could be the next. His availability because of the CPL is a concern but that hasn't stopped them picking Rashid in the past.\nWith 24 wickets at 16.5 in 19 previous Hundred games, while conceding at just 1.15 runs per ball, the experienced former West Indies international might be a shrewd pick.\nCurrent squad: Chris Woakes, Steve Smith (o), Jonny Bairstow, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Tom Abell, Luke Wells, Stephen Eskinazi.\nWhat do they need? Bowlers! Fire released all of them, with only Woakes coming in. Franchise-leading wicket-taker David Payne was a particularly surprising release.\nNew Zealand quick Matt Henry is an exceptional new-ball bowler in helpful conditions and in high demand after his Champions Trophy exploits.\nHe has 11 wickets at 11.9 in eight previous games for Welsh Fire.\nThe Hundred 2025: Full squad lists\nAnderson 'hungry' for Hundred chance\nMaxwell and Healy among big names in Hundred draft\nCurrent squad: Ellyse Perry (o), Amy Jones, Emily Arlott, Megan Schutt (o), Hannah Baker, Charis Pavely, Sterre Kalis, Ailsa Lister.\nWhat do they need? A top-order batter. The departure of Sophie Devine leaves a big gap - but Phoenix will pick first in the women's draft.\nGeorgia Voll is a WPL star and now an Australia international. The 21-year-old's stock has only risen throughout the winter thanks to both franchise and international exploits.\nSince the start of the 2024 WBBL, Voll is averaging 31 while striking at 148 across 22 innings. She's also the fastest scoring batter inside the powerplay in this timeframe.\nLondon Spirit are expected to bring back Heather Knight after she led them to victory in 2024\nCurrent squad: Grace Harris (o), Danielle Gibson, Sarah Glenn, Charlie Dean, Deepti Sharma (o), Georgia Redmayne (o), Eva Gray, Cordelia Griffith, Tara Norris, Sophie Munro.\nWhat do they need? Their title-winning captain. After lifting the title last year, Spirit followed both Oval Invincibles and Welsh Fire in retaining 10 players, with their 11th an established player returning in the top bracket.\nSkipper Heather Knight was superb with the bat for the Spirit last year, finishing as the second leading run-scorer behind Nat Sciver-Brunt. She also finished not out in four successful chases last year.\nCurrent squad: Amelia Kerr (o), Sophie Ecclestone, Beth Mooney (o), Lauren Filer, Mahika Gaur, Eve Jones, Kathryn Bryce, Fi Morris, Danielle Gregory.\nWhat do they need? A dynamic middle-order batter. With Beth Mooney and Amelia Kerr expected to score the bulk of the runs, the Originals will be looking for a quick scoring batter to finish off innings.\nNo-one strikes a longer ball than Deandra Dottin. The big-hitting Barbadian has history in Originals colours, scoring 259 runs in 10 innings across the 2022 and 2023 editions, with an impressive 32 average and 140 strike-rate.\nMady Villiers won The Hundred with Oval Invincibles in 2021 and 2022\nCurrent squad: Phoebe Litchfield (o), Annabel Sutherland (o), Georgia Wareham (o), Kate Cross, Bess Heath, Linsey Smith, Hollie Armitage, Alice Davidson-Richards, Grace Ballinger, Davina Perrin.\nWhat do they need? The best player available. With the Superchargers not picking until round nine, they'll have jump on whoever drops down.\nMady Villiers has been a mainstay at Oval Invincibles and, while capable of bowling in both the powerplay and at the death, her ability to keep it tight through the middle has helped her side squeeze opposition.\nVilliers would elevate the likes of Sutherland and Wareham as wicket-taking options by holding up an end.\nCurrent squad: Marizanne Kapp (o), Alice Capsey, Lauren Winfield-Hill, Amanda-Jade Wellington (o), Meg Lanning (o), Tash Farrant, Ryana Macdonald-Gay, Sophia Smale, Jo Gardner, Rachel Slater.\nWhat do they need? Continuity. Jonathan Batty has kept a core of players throughout his time as Invincibles head coach and has been joined by his WPL skipper Meg Lanning in the off-season.\nPaige Scholfield has capped herself at \u00a350,000 for the draft and looks all but certain to return to the Invincibles.\nScholfield has flipped between opening and a middle-order role across the last couple of years, making her the perfect squad batter to complement the established stars.\nChinelle Henry has starred for UP Warriorz at the WPL\nCurrent squad: Laura Wolvaardt (o), Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Maia Bouchier, Lauren Bell, Freya Kemp, Georgia Adams, Tilly Corteen-Coleman, Rhianna Southby.\nWhat do they need? All-round talent.\nLauren Bell led the Brave in wickets last year with nine, but that was only joint 13th best in the competition. With the bat, Brave's scoring rate in the final 25 balls of the match was the second lowest in the competition, a clear sign of a lack of power.\nWest Indies' Chinelle Henry has lit up the 2025 WPL, averaging 27 while striking at 196 with the bat, hitting more sixes (15) than fours (12).\nHenry is also a capable new-ball swing bowler, keeping her economy inside the powerplay below a run-a-ball.\nCurrent squad: Ash Gardner (o), Nat Sciver-Brunt, Alana King (o), Heather Graham (o), Bryony Smith, Grace Scrivens, Kirstie Gordon, Alexa Stonehouse, Natasha Wraith, Cassidy McCarthy.\nWhat do they need? X-factor pace. While pace isn't everything, the Rockets were the only side last year to not register a ball over 70mph in the entire competition.\nWhile spinners Gardner and King are exceptional, they could be backed up by spells of fiery pace.\nLook no further than Issy Wong. While she has had a tough time of late, only Lauren Filer is also capable of clocking into the late 70s among domestic bowlers.\nSophia Dunkley played for Welsh Fire in 2023 and 2024\nCurrent squad: Hayley Matthews (o), Tammy Beaumont, Jess Jonassen (o), Shabnim Ismail (o), Sarah Bryce, Georgia Elwiss, Freya Davies, Georgia Davis, Emily Windsor, Beth Langston.\nWhat do they need? Continuity. Welsh Fire have retained the core of last year's runners-up side and will look to do the same with their only pick in the top eight rounds, with Sophia Dunkley expected to return.\nDunkley started the 2024 Hundred brightly before her form tailed off.\nThis shouldn't put off the Fire from retaining her in the top bracket, with Dunkley performing well for England at times this winter - hitting 59 off 30 balls in Sydney during the Women's Ashes.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Retailers are also advised to make parents fully aware of this guidance.\"\nThe FSA added: \"While the symptoms of glycerol intoxication are usually mild, it is important that parents are aware of the risks - particularly at high levels of consumption.\"",

        "article_text": "On his 18th birthday, Raphinha sat alone in his tiny room in Florianopolis, staring at his phone. No messages. No calls. No offers. Injured and out of the Avai U20 team, he was on the verge of giving up. \nFootball had been his escape from the favelas of Brazil's Porto Alegre, but now it felt like a dead end. His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nHe again showed his worth in Tuesday's last-16 second leg against Benfica, scoring twice to help send Barca through to the quarter-finals.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out. \nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles. \nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football. \nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of \u00a350m, potentially rising to \u00a355 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club. \nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\n\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 26 goals and 19 assists in 40 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal, who also played a starring role in Tuesday's win over Benfica, has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football. \nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training. It is this discipline that has been key to raising him to his physical and mental peak.\nAnd now he has reached this point, there is no stopping him and if Barcelona go far in the Champions League, nobody should argue his right to be considered one of the top players in the world.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Syria's defence ministry says it has completed a military operation in the country's western coastal region, after days of violence in which hundreds of people have been killed.\nSecurity forces had \"neutralized\" loyalists of former president Bashar al-Assad in several towns in Latakia and Tartous provinces and were \"paving the way for life to return to normal\", a ministry spokesman said.\nA monitoring group says more than 1,500 people have been killed since Thursday, including 1,068 civilians.\nGunmen loyal to the Sunni Islamist-led government have been accused of carrying out revenge killings against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect following a deadly ambush on a security patrol.\nThe interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has said he will set up an independent committee to investigate the killings and insisted the perpetrators would be held accountable.\nThe violence is the worst in Syria since Sharaa led the lightning rebel offensive that overthrew Assad in December, ending 13 years of devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others were forced to flee their homes.\nDefence ministry spokesman Hassan Abdul Ghani announced on X that the security operation in Latakia and Tartous had ended after \"achieving all the specified objectives\".\n\"Our forces have neutralised the security cells and remnants of the former regime from the town of al-Mukhtareyah, the town of al-Mazairaa, the area of al-Zobar, and other locations in Latakia province, as well as Dalia town, Tanita town, and Qadmous in Tartous province, resulting in the thwarting of threats and securing the area,\" he said.\nHe also said that public institutions in the region were now able to resume their work, adding: \"We are preparing for the return of normal life and working to reinforce security and stability.\"\nAbdul Ghani promised that security forces would also \"give the investigating committee the full opportunity to uncover the circumstances of these incidents, verify the facts and deliver justice to the oppressed\".\nIn an interview on Monday, Sharaa acknowledged that there were \"many violations\" following the outbreak of violence and promised to punish everyone responsible, including his own allies if necessary.\n\"Syria is a state of law. The law will take its course on all,\" he told Reuters news agency.\n\"We fought to defend the oppressed, and we won't accept that any blood be shed unjustly, or goes without punishment or accountability, even among those closest to us,\" he said. \nThe government launched the operation in Latakia province in response to a growing insurgency by Assad loyalists in recent weeks. The region is the heartland of the Alawite sect, to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged.\nOn Thursday, security personnel were ambushed by gunmen in the town of Jableh as they tried to arrest a wanted Assad regime official. At least 13 officers were reportedly killed.\nSecurity forces responded by sending reinforcements to the region, who were joined by armed supporters of the government. Over the next four days, they stormed many Alawite towns and villages, where residents said they carried out revenge killings and lootings.\nA widely shared video showed the bodies of at least two dozen men in civilian clothing, piled in the yard of a house, in al-Mukhtareyah. Elsewhere, accounts emerged of fighters searching for Alawite members and killing entire families on the spot.\nHiba, an Alawite woman in Baniyas, told the BBC that Chechen fighters loyal to the government had attacked her neighbourhood.\n\"Our neighbours were killed including children. They came and took everything, gold, everything\u2026 They stole all of the cars in the neighbourhood. They even went to the supermarket and they took everything from the shelves.\"\n\"We were waiting for our turn. We didn't know when it would come.

        "article_text": "Architecture group Foster + Partners has released some concept images of the proposed new stadium\nManchester United have announced ambitious plans to build a new \u00a32bn 100,000-capacity stadium close to their current home at Old Trafford.\nRed Devils co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted to build the \"world's greatest football stadium\".\nBut when? And how can they afford it? What does it look like? And what happens to the current stadium? \nBBC Sport looks at some of the key questions surrounding the project.\nKey questions, images & reaction to Man Utd's new \u00a32bn stadium\nMan Utd plan to build 'iconic' \u00a32bn 100,000-capacity stadium\nThe Football News Show: Manchester United unveil new stadium plans\nManchester United believe the new stadium can be completed in five years.\nA project of this size would normally take about 10 years to complete.\nHowever, the club think they can halve the building time by making full use of the Manchester ship canal.\n\"Normally, if you were building a 100,000-seater stadium from the ground up, in an area that needs to be regenerated, it's a 10-year project. But if we get going with the government then I think it's a five-year project, not a 10-year project,\" said Ratcliffe.\nThe club plan to build large parts of the stadium off-site before shipping it to the Old Trafford site via the Manchester ship canal.\n\"It will be a modular build - that means it can be built far more quickly,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"There are yards which specialise in building very large structures, which are then shipped to locations around the world.\"\nArchitect Norman Foster added: \"Normally a stadium would take 10 years to build, we halved that time - five years. How do we do that? By pre-fabrication, by using the network of Manchester ship canal, bring it back to a new life, shipping in components, 160 of them, Meccano-like.\"\nThere is no confirmed starting date.\nRatcliffe says the project will depend on how 'quickly' the government are with kick-starting their regeneration project of the area.\n\"On the timeline for this, it starts with a discussion,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"It depends how quickly the government get going with their regeneration programme. I think they want to get going quite quickly, because they want to see progress in this parliament.\n\"I'm assuming that will go well and it will go quickly.\"\nUnited's chief operating officer Collette Roche says the club will work closely with the authorities to make the project proceed \"as smooth and quick as possible\".\n\"One of the things we are establishing is a mayoral development corporation, that gives a lot of rights to speed these things through,\" she added.\n\"You also heard today that Jim mentioned us potentially doing some pre-fabrication. So that means we can do a lot of the enabling works and start to design and build the pieces in advance of having to do anything on the ground in Old Trafford.\"\nIt is unclear what will happen to United's existing home - but it looks unlikely the current Old Trafford will be kept.\nArchitects Foster and Partners had suggested Old Trafford would be demolished - and there is no sign of the current stadium in the new artists impressions.\nGiven the proximity of the new stadium to the current site, this option looks likely.\n\"By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford,\" Ratcliffe said.\nIt had been suggested in 2024 that the current stadium could be scaled back and used as a home for United's women and youth teams.\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said the club may revisit that plan, but it is \"unlikely\".\n\nThat's the ambition.\nBerrada says the club wants to grow the women's team fanbase enough for them to play at the main stadium, which could incorporate matches or events with smaller capacities.\nHe added they were looking at pitch technology that would allow for the surface to be in \"mint condition\" for both the men's and women's teams.\nRoche added: \"The great thing about having this type of stadium is it can actually be creative for different venues.\n\"There is technology now that can still give you a sense of a smaller, great atmospheric stadium. That could benefit the women's team with a smaller crowd \u2013 and that's the kind of thing we are looking at.\"\nManchester United say the new stadium will cost about \u00a32bn.\n\"We're looking at a ballpark [figure] of \u00a32bn,\" Berrada told BBC sports editor Dan Roan.\nThe club have not said how the stadium will be financed.\nThere are several options on the table, such as loans, private investment or investment from co-owner Ratcliffe.\nHowever, the proposal to build a new \u00a32bn stadium runs alongside the cost-cutting measures being made by Ratcliffe since his investment in the club.\n'What we're doing now is try to put ourselves in the best financial position to be able to finance a stadium and other infrastructure projects,\" said Berrada.\n\"Our aim is to be the most profitable club within three years. We think this will put us in the best financial footing to make this investment and to work with private investors who are willing to work with us.\"\nThe club are more than \u00a31bn in debt.\nHowever, football finance expert Kieran Maguire says the club have more headroom to borrow money.\n\"The good news for Manchester United is that the club is in a position to borrow substantial sums, despite existing levels of debt,\" Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"If the club does borrow a substantial amount of the estimated \u00a32bn cost of the new stadium, it is likely to do so with some form of interest only loan.\n\"When Tottenham took a similar approach to building a new stadium in London a few years ago, they negotiated at very low interest rates. These loans have resulted in Tottenham's interest costs rising from \u00a312m in the final season at White Hart Lane in 2016-17 to \u00a346m in 2022-23. During that same period matchday income had increased by \u00a372m and commercial income by \u00a3155m.\n\"The increase in commercial income is due to the club having a bigger multi-function stadium, used for a myriad football and non-football events such as NFL, music concerts and boxing.\"\nSpeaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Ratcliffe said: \"The financing is not the issue, I think it's eminently financeable. But the detail of that we'd rather talk about in the future. It will be financeable, I think.\"\nRatcliffe told the Overlap podcast, external that no public money will be used to build the stadium, but the project will not be possible without wider regeneration funded by the government.\n\"We can't afford to regenerate southern Manchester. It is too big a bill for the club,\" he said.\n\"We don't need any government funding for the stadium, but it has to be the underpin for the regeneration.\"\nAccording to Berrada, no.\n\"We don't want to inhibit our ability to invest in the team, for us to continue being competitive while we are building a new stadium,\" he added.\n\"There are various ways around that. One of the things we are looking at is to shorten the construction timelines.\n\"In the meantime, by getting our finances back in order and becoming profitable, we believe that we can be very competitive.\n\"The big, big benefit that this club has is that it has the biggest fanbase in the world and therefore the ability to be the number one in terms of revenues that it generates.\"\nRoche added: \"Our number one goal is to get our teams winning and to get the men's team competing for all the titles consistently. We are not going to deviate from that.\"\n'Some Man Utd players not good enough & overpaid'\nSir Jim Ratcliffe: The Interview\nThe new stadium is to be built next to Old Trafford, which Ratcliffe hopes will \"preserve the essence\" of their current home.\nThe new stadium will form part of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already given Government backing to the plans.\nUnited say the project has the potential to create 92,000 new jobs, bring an additional 1.8 million visitors to the area annually and will be worth an additional \u00a37.3bn per year to the UK economy.\nOld Trafford's current capacity is 74,310, so the new stadium will accommodate more than 25,000 new spectators.\nHow will United fill it? And who will they be?\n\"Those Manchester United fans on the waiting list for season tickets may be disappointed if they thought the additional capacity of the stadium would result in many more season tickets becoming available,\" said Maguire. \n\"Manchester United have a huge global fanbase who are more likely to be willing to pay higher prices than those available to season ticket holders. Liverpool have in recent years increased the capacity of Anfield from 45,000 to over 61,000 as owners Fenway Sports Group have made most of the extra tickets available to fans in the membership scheme rather than those who want to have a coveted season ticket.\"\nIn a statement, the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) said fans \"remain anxious\" about the plans and whether ticket prices will be driven up, forcing out local supporters.\n\"We look forward to further consultation with supporters discussing these vital questions with the club. If they are able to produce a new stadium as stunning as the plans suggest without harming the atmosphere, without hiking ticket prices and without harming investment elsewhere, then this could be very exciting.\n\"But until the questions are answered, our optimism about plans to make Old Trafford the biggest and the best again will be restrained by caution about what the consequences for fans might be.\"\nMan Utd's new \u00a32bn stadium - all the key reaction and best images\nFans tell of hopes and fears for new Man Utd stadium\nThis video can not be played\nWatch promotional film of Man Utd's new stadium\nArchitects at Foster and Partners, who will design the project, said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is \"twice the size of Trafalgar Square\".\nThe design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200 metres high and visible from 25 miles away.\n\"As you move away from the stadium, it's not a fortress surrounded by a sea of cars.

        "article_text": "Greenland's centre-right opposition Democratic party has unexpectedly won the territory's general election. \nThe semi-autonomous island is currently controlled by Denmark, and the vote was dominated by the question of independence, and US President Donald Trump's repeated pledge to take it over, \"one way or another\".\nThe Democratic party favours a gradual approach to independence, and has promised to work with the other political parties to take this forward.\nGreenland, the world's largest island, is located in the Arctic.\nIt is also the most sparsely populated territory. About 56,000 people live there, mostly indigenous Inuit people.\nAbout 80% of its territory is covered by ice, meaning most people live on the south-western coast around the capital, Nuuk.\nAn autonomous - or self-governing - territory of Denmark, it is also home to Danish and US military bases.\nGreenland's economy is mainly based on fishing. Large subsidies from the Danish government account for about a fifth of its income, or GDP.\nIn recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. \nThese may become more accessible as global warming leads to some of the ice covering Greenland to melt.\nLocated geographically within North America, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years.\nThe island was governed as a colony until the mid-20th Century. For much of this time, it remained isolated and poor.\nIn 1953, it was made part of the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlanders became Danish citizens.\nIn 1979, a referendum on home rule gave Greenland control of most policies within the territory, with Denmark retaining control over foreign affairs and defence.\nThe US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War Two, the US invaded Greenland, establishing military and radio stations across the territory.\nAfter the war, US forces remained in Greenland. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US ever since.\nIn 1951, a defence agreement with Denmark granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases.\n\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. \n\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"\nChina and Russia have begun building up their Arctic military capabilities in recent years, according to an Arctic Institute paper. The paper called for the US to further develop its presence in the Arctic to counter its rivals. \nIn January, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Denmark was open to discussions with the US, adding that Washington had \"legitimate\" interests in the region. \n\"We see a Russia that is arming itself. We see a China that is also starting to take an interest,\" Rasmussen said. \nTrump is also likely interested in the mining potential across Greenland's vast landmass, Mr Jacobsen added, especially the rare earth minerals in the south. \nDuring a speech to Congress, Trump said that control of Greenland was essential \"for national security and international security.\"\nHe said he strongly supported the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future.\n\"If you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,\" he added.\nThough the president's rhetoric may seem unusual, a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland for more than a century. \n\"The US has tried a few times to push the Danes out of Greenland and take it over as part of the US, or at least to have full security tutelage of Greenland,\" said Lukas Wahden, the author of 66\u00b0 North, a newsletter on Arctic security.\nIn 1867, after buying Alaska from Russia, US Secretary of State William H Seward led negotiations to buy Greenland from Denmark, but failed to reach any agreement.\nIn 1946, the US offered to pay $100m (equivalent to $1.2bn; \u00a3970m today) for the territory, judging that it was vital for national security, but the Danish government refused.\nTrump also tried to buy Greenland during his first presidential term. \nBoth Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"\nThe debate over the territory's independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", according to Masaana Egede, editor of the newspaper Sermitsiaq.\nAccording to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark.  \nBut an opinion survey in January found that 85% of Greenlanders rejected the idea of becoming part of the US, versus 6% who wanted it. The rest were undecided. \nWhen BBC correspondent Fergal Keane visited the island in January, he said he heard one phrase again and again: \"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders. So, Trump can visit but that's it.\"\nThe issue took centre stage in the election. \n\"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" said outgoing Prime Minister Egede during the campaign.\nHe previously said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\", but wanted to take gradual steps towards autonomy.\nIn contrast, the opposition party Naleraq wanted to immediately start divorce proceedings from Denmark and have closer defence dealings with Washington.\nSpeaking after the election results, Democratic leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that \"Greenland needs us to stand together in a time of great interest from outside.\"\n\"There is a need for unity, so we will enter into negotiations with everyone,\" he added.\nWhen Trump first raised the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, many locals told the BBC they were opposed to the proposal. \n\"This is a very dangerous idea,\" said Dines Mikaelsen, a tour operator who was born and raised in Tasiilaq, east Greenland.\n\"He's treating us like a good he can purchase,\" said Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister.

        "article_text": "On his 18th birthday, Raphinha sat alone in his tiny room in Florianopolis, staring at his phone. No messages. No calls. No offers. Injured and out of the Avai U20 team, he was on the verge of giving up. \nFootball had been his escape from the favelas of Brazil's Porto Alegre, but now it felt like a dead end. His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nHe again showed his worth in Tuesday's last-16 second leg against Benfica, scoring twice to help send Barca through to the quarter-finals.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out. \nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles. \nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football. \nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of \u00a350m, potentially rising to \u00a355 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club. \nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\n\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 26 goals and 19 assists in 40 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal, who also played a starring role in Tuesday's win over Benfica, has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football. \nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training. It is this discipline that has been key to raising him to his physical and mental peak.\nAnd now he has reached this point, there is no stopping him and if Barcelona go far in the Champions League, nobody should argue his right to be considered one of the top players in the world.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Major oil spills can be catastrophic for seabirds and marine life. Nearly 15 years on from the biggest marine spill in history, are we any better at cleaning up oil at sea? Jocelyn Timperley examines the latest science of ocean clean-ups.\nOn April 20, 2010, a blowout caused a huge explosion on the offshore drilling rig operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven people were killed. Two days later, the rig collapsed. Oil began seeping into the sea, and it continued to flow for almost three months.\nThe Deepwater Horizon disaster is among the most lamented environmental catastrophes of the past century. It's hard to comprehend how incredibly huge the spill was. It was the world's largest ever marine oil spill, releasing an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil (779 million litres, or over 300 Olympic swimming pools-worth). Up to a million seabirds were killed outright, and the human health and socioeconomic effects are still being felt today.\nNorth Sea oil spill\nOn 10 March 2025, two ships collided in the North Sea: the oil tanker MV Stena Immaculate and a cargo ship called Solong.\nThe company that owns Immaculate has said that the ship's load \u2013 jet fuel \u2013 is now leaking into the sea.\nFollow\u00a0BBC News' live page on the collision here.\nBP, rig operator Transocean, and several government agencies immediately tried to limit the damage, with BP's chief executive saying the company was \"determined to do everything in our power\" to contain the spill. Booms were deployed to try to contain the oil, skimmer ships nibbled at the edges of the widening slick and fires were set to try to burn it off the sea surface. Various devices were deployed deep below the surface to try to contain or capture the oil. BP also began to spray the oil with enormous amounts of dispersants both on the sea surface and 1.5km (0.9 miles) underwater, where oil was gushing from the wellhead.\nHowever, it is thought that these measures recovered or dispersed only around a third of the spilled oil. The BP spill sparked a huge amount of research into oil spills and their impacts. But 14 years on, what hope is there for better measures should another oil spill occur?\nJeffrey Short, an expert in oil spills and now-retired scientist from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), was working for Oceana, a marine conservation organisation when the BP spill occurred. When a colleague told him about the spill at lunchtime, he felt sick.\n\"I knew immediately that this would be ecologically and economically disastrous, that it would wreck tens of thousands of people's lives, and that it would dominate my professional life for the next several years,\" he says. \"All of which proved true.\"\nOil spills are the third largest source of oil in the sea, after land-based runoff (largely from cities and vehicles) and natural oil seeps. The problem with spills, of course, is the sheer volume of oil that enters the sea all at once. This means that oil spills \u2013 especially big ones \u2013 are \"much, much more dangerous per unit oil released\", says Short.\nWhile no spill has since surpassed Deepwater Horizon's in sheer volume, Noaa responds to more than 150 oil spills every year. Just last month, oil began spewing from a submerged\u00a0oil tanker and at least two other sunken vessels in Manila Bay, in the Philippines, after they were hit by monsoon rains and Typhoon Gaemi.\u00a0Another oil tanker hit by projectiles from Yemen's Houthi movement remains in a precarious position in the Red Sea. However, the number of oil spills from tankers is today far lower than in the 1970s, due to improved standards.\nWhen oil spills occur, the first step is to control the source, \"whether that be a ship, pipeline, or leaking well\", says Doug Helton, regional supervisor of the emergency response division at Noaa's Office of Response and Restoration. \"The second priority is recovering oil at sea.\"\nThe major priority is to avoid the oil reaching the shoreline, where it can do the most damage. Shoreline cleanups can last days to years, depending on the type of oil and severity of contamination, says Helton.\nSpilt oil tends to spread quickly into a thin layer on the sea surface. Within days, centimetres-thick layers become a film of a millimetre or less, spread in drifting patches over a wide area. Efforts to scoop up the oil from the sea surface therefore offer diminishing returns as time goes on. \"Floating oil spreads very quickly and there is a limited window of time \u2013 days \u2013 when at-sea tools are effective,\" says Helton.\nHundreds of skimmers were deployed to clean up the BP Deep Horizon spill. Skimmers are boats that scoop up spilled oil from the water's surface, usually after the slick is first surrounded with floating booms to keep it from spreading. They do this in various ways \u2013 some, for example, suck up the oil like a vacuum cleaner, while others use oil-attracting \"conveyor belts\" or gravity to carry the spilled oil into a reservoir.\nBut hopes at the time that the skimmers could pick up oil \"like a lawnmower cutting grass\" proved to be overblown. They only recovered an estimated 3% of the oil. \"At sea, the oil may spread more rapidly than the skimming vessels trying to capture oil,\" says Helton. \"Going faster is not an easy option because the bow wave from the ship will push the oil away.\"\nThe satellite photos of the BP disaster \"speak volumes\", says Short. \"You'll see a half a dozen surface skimming boats that, from the sea surface next to the boat, look quite large and quite effective. But from a satellite, you realise that you are [...] just having a nearly negligible effect on the size of the spill.\"\nIn fact, a 2020 review of 30 large offshore oil spills found only 2-6% of oil was recovered using mechanical methods like skimmers. Short says that mechanical recovery has improved in recent decades, with better booms to corral the oil and better systems to remove it from the sea surface. But even with improvements, mechanical methods can't have much impact on a large spill, he says.\nIn recent years a plethora of studies and reports have emerged looking at different ways to soak up oil spills, from laser-treated cork and textiles based on leaves to graphene, magnets and even hair and fur. These mostly rely on the oil-attracting and water-hating properties of the material, with various forms of oil-attracting sponges a particularly common solution. But the difficulty of handling oil-soaked materials means these techniques are typically only useful for small spills.\nWhen Guihua Yu, a professor of materials science at the University of Texas at Austin, and his team began considering whether a new material his lab was working on could be used to help clean up oil spills, he says he was surprised about the lack of focus on how these innovative materials could be used in practice.\nOne central problem, he says, is that most can only be used in a non-continuous way, requiring processing to remove the oil before the same material can be used again.\nYu and his team landed on a solution which he thinks could help. In a 2023 paper, his lab developed a prototype with a collection speed 10 times faster than current clean up rates.\nThe lab produced their own super oleophilic gel capable of 99% separation of oil from water, which they used to cover a mesh filter. But they also designed a continuous roller system, which Yu says would be attached to the front of a ship. This conveyer belt picks up oil from the water surface, then rolls it round to beside an induction heater, which heats the oil, detaching it and allowing it to drip down to a collector in the middle. The roller is freed up to be directly reused as it rolls down to the water again.\n\"The most important [innovation in our work] is probably higher throughput,\" says Yu. \"I personally felt it's very unique and very different from what is conventional.\"\nThe invention has so far only been tested on a small motor oil spill in a lake in China using a metre-scale prototype, but Yu says he has had conversations with industry potentially interested in scaling it up. The overall costs, he believes, would be reasonable. However, he admits his current design does not address the bow-wave issue of oil being pushed away from the ship, noting that how to balance collection and bow wave is \"worthy of further investigation\".\nBut Short says that, for large spills which require more than a day to clean up, movement of oil during the night (when operations can usually not be carried out) will always limit the efficacy of collecting oil on the sea surface.\n\"The following day, the oil must first be located before response equipment can be effectively deployed,\" he says. \"For large spills, especially when response equipment is limited, these challenges may limit the amount of recoverable oil to less than 10% of the initial spill volume.\"\nStill, improvements have been made in tracking the oil too. Noaa now uses drones and satellites to help find and track oil spills, and tools for mapping and coordination have advanced. Undersea manned and autonomous tools that can tap into sunken vessels to extract oil have also been developed since the Deepwater Horizon spill, says Helton.\nBurning is another, more controversial, way to remove floating oil at sea. An estimated 5% of the BP oil spill was burnt off the surface.\nBurning requires concentrating the oil on the sea surface to at least 2-3mm \u2013 relatively thick for an oil spill. It also requires quick action, and lucky weather conditions. In the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska in 1989, a storm dispersed the oil over a wide area into a film too thin to catch alight.\nImproved boom designs to better corral oil have improved the effectiveness of burning over the years, says Short. But successful burning also has its own problems for the environment and human health in the form of air pollution.\nThe impacts of air pollution on the workers attempting to clean up the BP oil spill are still being investigated today. A major 2022 study found that workers involved in cleaning up the spill were 60% more likely to be diagnosed with asthma or experience asthma symptoms one to three years after the spill, compared with those who did not work on the cleanup.\nBurning is not the only culprit for air pollution. The evaporation of the oil itself is also highly toxic, as is another controversial way to try to dissipate the impacts of oil spills: dispersants.\nDuring the Deepwater Horizon disaster, BP sprayed roughly 1.84 million gallons (8.37 million litres) of the dispersant Corexit on the surface and deep into the water column \u2013 the largest volume of dispersant ever used for an oil spill.\nDispersants work by breaking down the oil into smaller droplets that can mix with the water below, which both helps it to degrade and removes it from the surface, where it tends to do most damage (especially to diving seabirds, surfacing marine mammals, turtles and young fish). But it needs to be added quickly after oil spills.\nLittle was known about exactly how this quantity of dispersant would affect the environment in the BP spill, but the hope was that it would stop the oil from reaching shoreline habitats. But the sheer volume used has been widely criticised as largely ineffective as well as harmful to the environment and humans. It's thought just 8% of the oil was dispersed using Corexit.\nIn Short's view, prior knowledge about oil spills meant that in the Deepwater Horizon spill \"you can be quite certain in advance\" that the continued application of dispersants on parts of the oil slick which had already emulsified was \"a waste of time\" beyond the first few days. \"But it shows the public that you're doing something.\"\nEnvironmentalists and scientists have a term for these kinds of reactions to oil spills \u2013 \"response theatre\". It describes when companies responsible for a spill focus more on being seen to do something about the spill than necessarily doing the best thing.\nSome researchers, however, say the dispersants were relatively effective and may have helped avoid further air pollution by getting rid of the oil. A 2019 report from the US National Academies found that dispersants can help cope with oil spills in some circumstances, but that limitations in the research make it hard to make conclusions about whether it improves the human health aspect compared to not using dispersants.\nStill, counterintuitive as it may sound, there are occassions where some interventions could be a worse option than leaving an oil spill alone. In many places, ocean microbes have developed to eat the oil seeping naturally into the environment. These same bacteria and fungi can munch away at oil spills too \u2013 albeit relatively slowly and some more than others \u2013 but if they are impacted by chemicals, such as those in dispersants, this process could be disrupted.\nBioremediation \u2013 such as adding nutrients to encourage oil-degrading bacteria \u2013 has a long history of use in oil spills. But scientists are still at the beginning of understanding the complex interactions between microbial communities and chemical dispersants, as well as how these interact with environmental factors like temperature and sunlight. Research, for example, has shown that sunlight levels impact oil degradation in different microbes differently.\nA study published in 2024 became the first to use an advanced microbiology technique to look at these interactions. Rather than look at the DNA of microbes, as previous studies have done, the scientists examined the protein expression of microbes in waters off the coast of Florida \u2013 a technique usually only used in medical or clinical science.\nUsing these techniques can show far more detail than looking at DNA alone, says Sabine Matallana-Surget, an associate professor of environmental and molecular microbiology at the University of Stirling, Scotland, who led the study. If she did a similar study on humans, for example, she would be able to tell when they had lunch by tracking the enzymes involved in food digestion.\nMore like this: \nHer team found that Corexit induces a high expression of proteins involved in oxidative stress in oil-degrading bacteria. \"I have never seen so many proteins involving DNA damage [and] repair, [as] when you introduce the Corexit to your microbial community,\" says Matallana-Surget. More sunlight also increased the toxicity of Corexit and oil in their experiment, creating a \"double pill effect\", she adds.\nThe team plan to conduct similar experiments in other places with natural seepages of oil, with different microbes, temperature and sunlight levels. If there is another oil spill in one of these places, Matallana-Surget says, these findings could inform the optimum level of Corexit to use in that particular location for maximum oil recovery. \"I'm hoping that in the near future, if there was an accident somewhere else, we would be able to say, 'Well, listen, no, you shouldn't apply Corexit in that region, or not as much, or maybe this concentration.'\"\nDispersants aren't the only intervention after oil spills that have caused concern. \"We have found after lengthy research that aggressive cleanup of some environments can cause more harm than the oil,\" says Helton. \"Marshes and sheltered intertidal habitats, for example, are often treated very carefully.\"\nThe high-pressure, hot-water washing used to clean the ecologically sensitive shorelines of Prince William Sound in Alaska after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, for example, sterilised the beaches, inadvertently killing bacteria as well as larger animals. Research has shown that areas not cleaned by the hot water recovered faster than the treated sites.\nCleaning seabirds\nOil-soaked birds are often one of the most immediate and visible impact of oil spills, and depressing survival rates \u2013 which can be lower than 1%\u00a0\u2013 led experts such as German biologist Silvia Gaus to argue euthanasia is a more humane option.\nBut wildlife rescuers say these rates may be improving as they learn better animal husbandry, such as allowing rest and hydration before embarking on the stressful process of removing oil from feathers. Guidelines have also been developed for cleaning turtles and marine mammals.\nIf a spill like Deepwater Horizon happened today, says Matallana-Surget, the reaction would be completely different. \"There have been huge conversations around what happened with applying tonnes of [a] chemical [where] we have no idea what's going in the environment. I think nobody in any part of the world would do that.\"\nUltimately, since spills are so hard to clean up, avoiding them happening in the first place remains the most important thing. \"Prevention is going to be the most fruitful line of approach,\" says Short. \"Continuing to implement safety measures and especially being vigilant.\" The problem is that standards are expensive to maintain, he says. If years go by without a spill, they \"tend to start slipping\".\nMajor changes have been made to US regulations governing offshore oil and gas operations, as well as advances in preventing blowouts in the first place. New performance measures and enforcement mechanisms have been introduced to improve pipeline safety. However, there are also new potential risks for oil spills: deeper drilling, ageing infrastructure, transport of new types of oil and through different routes such as the Arctic, and climate impacts like sea-level rise and more intense and frequent storms.\nA report released by BP in September 2010 concluded that decisions made by \"multiple companies and work teams\", including BP and others, had contributed to the spill. The unprecedented costs \u2013 over $65bn (\u00a349bn) \u2013 to BP of the Deepwater Horizon has acted as an incentive to companies maintain the vigilance to avoid future disasters, says Short. \"I think that's really got a lot of attention in the industry, that this is not a trivial operating expense that you can just write off as business as usual.\"\nBP also quickly announced $500m (\u00a3380m) for a 10 year research programme, which has been credited with galvanising advancement in oil spill science.\nBut while risks can be reduced, so long as oil is being produced, \"you're not going to get rid of [spills]\", adds Short. Oil supply is set to reach a record high this year, with the US last year producing more oil than any country ever has before. Until oil dependence begins to fall, sadly the risks of another oil spill will stay with us.\nBoth BP and ExxonMobil declined to comment for this article.\n* Jocelyn Timperley is a senior journalist for BBC Future.
