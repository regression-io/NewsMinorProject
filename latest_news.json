Some customers told the BBC that M&S' communication over affected orders has been \"disappointing\".\nAnalysts warn the incident may affect the retailer's reputation.\nCustomers have been telling the BBC of the impact the situation is having on them.\nLinda Sonntag, who lives in Norwich, told the BBC she was left \"disappointed\" after a flower delivery arranged for a friend never arrived.\nShe told the BBC she was still awaiting a refund and email with information about her order.\n\"In the meantime I've had to order flowers from somewhere else,\" she said.\n\"I don't blame them, they've had a cyber attack,\" Ms Sonntag added.\n\"But I don't think their attitude towards their customers is very helpful.\"\nDawn Cunnington, of Exeter, agreed the company was not to blame, but said she had no communication from M&S about her own flower order not being fulfilled.\nShe had ordered flowers on Wednesday, on behalf of her 91-year-old mother, for her mother's friend, who was celebrating their 90th birthday.\n\"I'd had nothing from them until I phoned up,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Cunnington said she received a refund and a \u00a310 apology voucher after calling M&S to find out what happened to the flowers, but was \"a bit cross\" they had allowed her to place the order in the first place, given it was aware of cyber incident.\nOther customers have described having to cancel orders for clothes which they were expecting to collect before going on holiday, or being unable to return goods they had previously bought.\nBut some have expressed sympathy for the staff at the stores, who they say have been on the receiving end of abuse from angry customers, or having to deal with shopping abandoned at the tills when customers were unable to pay when contactless payments were down.\nM&S remains silent on how the cyber attack unfolded, the nature of the attack and how specifically it has been affected by it - leaving cyber security experts to speculate as to what might have happened.\nIt is known it has hired external cyber security experts, who are likely to be a team of incident response specialists who will be working around the clock either at the headquarters of the company or remotely.\nTheir first priority is likely to be find out where the hackers are in the IT system and kick them out.\nSwitching off computer servers used in their online ordering, payment or logistics systems might imply that security teams have isolated that portion as a way the hackers gained entry.\nThey might also have taken these offline to stop the hackers from spreading their malicious software into those previously unaffected areas.\nIt might also be the case that the company is taking all non-business critical services offline to help deal with the hack.\n\"In situations like this, in-store services are typically prioritised for recovery, which can mean online operations take slightly longer to restore,\" said Sam Kirkman, a director at cyber-security firm NetSPI.\nHe told the BBC that while M&S taking steps like pausing services may make the incident seem \"even more serious from the outside,\" they would allow staff to contain any potential threats and begin recovery safely.\nAbout a third of M&S's clothing and household goods' sales in the UK are through its online platforms and were worth some \u00a31.268bn in latest published financial results. \nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said even though M&S's physical stores were still open, many of them \"simply don't stock the popular ranges from online\".\nShe added clothes sales were \"likely to take a big hit\" as the cyber-attack had occurred during a spell of warm weather when summer ranges would be \"piling up in virtual baskets\".\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said M&S's success was \"built on trust\" - and this was something customers may question after it suspended online orders.\n\"The longer it takes to draw a line under the cyber incident, the greater the risk to Marks & Spencer's reputation,\" he told the BBC. \n\"Shoppers want to know that their personal and financial details are safe when buying goods online and Marks & Spencer failing to give the all-clear implies that something is very wrong at its end.\"\nAdditional reporting by Michael Race",

I don't think I want to say a lot. The only thing now is to send my appreciation to Jurgen Klopp,\" Slot, who replaced Klopp as Liverpool manager last summer, told LFCTV.\nThe 46-year-old immediately launched into a rendition of the song Klopp asked Liverpool fans to sing after his final game last May, but replaced the lyrics 'Arne Slot' with 'Jurgen Klopp'.\n\"I am 99.9% sure that if I pick up my phone there will be a message from Jurgen,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"So many moments in the season the two of us have had contact. I think he showed last season what a wonderful human being he is by introducing me. \n\"But what mattered most is the team he left behind that was able to win the trophy.\"\nSlot, speaking to Sky Sports, added: \"The work Jurgen and Pep [Lijnders] did - the culture, work-rate, quality - was outstanding,\"\nThis video can not be played\nCommentary cam scenes as Liverpool win title\nFew expected Slot to oversee a successful title charge in his first season at Anfield, not least the man himself.\n\"We started really well and maybe it helped that [Manchester] City had a difficult spell that they have not had in five years,\" he said.\n\"When the season started, we would have been happy with top four. But I don't think that is fair on the players as they are much better than that and they have shown it this season.\"\nDominic Solanke gave Spurs a surprise lead at Anfield, but Slot had no doubts his side would turn things around.\n\"I think from the moment we arrived on the bus everyone could feel that we were never going to lose this game,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"The fans were so supportive before and during the game. Even at 1-0 down you felt this team and the fans could get it over the line.\"\nHe told LFCTV: \"They always find a way to win. I'm incredibly proud, not only of the players but the people standing here, sport directors, my staff members, we should give them a big round of applause.\n\"Let's forget it's the second title in 35 years... it's the second in five years.\"\nLiverpool crowned Premier League champions with thumping win over Tottenham - reaction\n'No-one expected this' - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title\nLiverpool rejoin Man Utd on 'perch' with 20th title\nLiverpool last won the Premier League five years ago, but the Coronavirus pandemic meant there were no fans inside Anfield to witness it.\nFor fans and players alike, a first title win in front of supporters since 1990 is something special.\n\"It's special to win it at Anfield - it's very difficult to describe,\" Mohamed Salah told BBC Sport.\n\"Everyone wanted Palace to finish it [at Arsenal on Wednesday], but I know what Anfield is like, so I'm glad we did it here.\n\"It's completely different [to the title in 2020]. The feeling is unbelievable. The first time was lockdown and the pandemic, but to be here five years later is incredible.\"\nSalah told Sky Sports: \"This is 100% better than last time.\"\nVirgil van Dijk - the first non-British captain to lead Liverpool to a top flight title - dedicated the triumph to the club's supporters.\n\"I was desperate to win it for them [the fans] and all the fans around the world, and for us as well,\" Van Dijk told Sky Sports.\n\"This is the most beautiful club in the world.

We are going to enjoy the next couple of weeks and take it in.\"\nThis video can not be played\nSalah on securing PL title after Tottenham win\nLeft-back Andy Robertson was also a member of the 2019-20 title-winning team, and he has now become just the third Scotsman to win multiple Premier League titles after Darren Fletcher and Brian McClair.\n\"Last time [we won the league in 2020] was a strange time,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\"It was unique the way we did it. We enjoyed it of course but you cannot beat what we experienced today. Nothing compares to that.\n\"It is special. For me, when I came to this club I quickly realised how good Scottish players have been here. There is a bit of pressure with that. I am glad I managed to continue that and hopefully can carry that forward.\"\nIt has been a remarkable few years for midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, who won the 2022 World Cup with Argentina before joining Liverpool in 2023.\n\"To win a World Cup and now a Premier League is really special,\" he said. \n\"But it would not be possible without my team-mates. I am just one part of the puzzle. This team has been really good the last two years. \n\"It wasn't enough last year but this year we made a big difference. Hopefully we can enjoy this week.\"\n20 of the best photos from Liverpool's momentous day\n'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'\nDespite uncertainty regarding his future hanging over him for much of this season, Salah has been sensational.\nHis 63rd-minute goal on Sunday was his 28th of the season, while he has set up another 18 for his team-mates.\n\"It's incredible. Winning the Premier League and having the impact I've had is incredible,\" Salah told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"For me, this [title] feels more special. Jurgen [Klopp] is not here and other players I respect a lot are not here, but to do it with a new manager and a new team shows what I'm capable of.\"\nDefending their title will not be easy, but having committed his immediate future to the club with a new two-year contract earlier this month, Salah is confident.\n\"People think it's going to get easier, but now it's going to be difficult because other teams will catch us and it's going to be harder for him [Slot],\" he said. \n\"Even in my time here, the second season was way harder.\n\"I believe next season and the year after will be great, for sure.\"\nSlot shared his star man's optimism.\n\"That is something we are definitely going to try [to defend the title],\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"But first we are going to enjoy the last few games.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMurphy on phenomenal first season for Slot",

I probably have a bit more belief in myself and I feel a lot more calm. \"Related topicsSnookerMore on this storyWatch World Snooker Championship: Trump beats Murphy, Si leads WoollastonTrump pockets \u00a3100,000 prize for 100 centuriesPublished19 hours ago",

        "article_text": "Will India be able to stop the Indus river and two of its tributaries from flowing into Pakistan?\nThat's the question on many minds, after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday's horrific attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. \nThe 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management.\nThe suspension is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism -  a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi, and said stopping water flow \"will be considered as an Act of War\". \nThe treaty allocated the three eastern rivers \u2013 the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej \u2013 of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones \u2013 the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab \u2013 to Pakistan.\nDisputes have flared in the past, with Pakistan objecting to some of India's hydropower and water infrastructure projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. (More than 80% of Pakistan's agriculture and around a third of its hydropower depend on the Indus basin's water.)\nIndia, meanwhile, has been pushing to review and modify the treaty, citing changing needs - from irrigation and drinking water to hydropower - in light of factors like climate change.\nOver the years, Pakistan and India have pursued competing legal avenues under the treaty brokered by the World Bank.\nBut this is the first time either side has announced a suspension - and notably, it's the upstream country, India, giving it a geographic advantage.\nBut what does the suspension really mean? Could India hold back or divert the Indus basin's waters, depriving Pakistan of its lifeline? And is it even capable of doing so?\nExperts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes.\n\"The infrastructure India has are mostly run-of-the-river hydropower plants that do not need massive storage,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, a regional water resources expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.\nSuch hydropower plants use the force of running water to spin turbines and generate electricity, without holding back large volumes of water.\nIndian experts say inadequate infrastructure has kept India from fully utilising even its 20% share of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus waters under the treaty - a key reason they argue for building storage structures, which Pakistan opposes citing treaty provisions.\nExperts say India can now modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan.\n\"Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan,\" said Mr Thakkar.\nBut challenges like difficult terrain and protests within India itself over some of its projects have meant that construction of water infrastructure in the Indus basin has not moved fast enough.\nAfter a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016, Indian water resources ministry officials had told the BBC they would speed up construction of several dams and water storage projects in the Indus basin.\nAlthough there is no official information on the status of such projects, sources say progress has been limited.\nSome experts say that if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest.\n\"A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season - when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical,\" Hassan F Khan, assistant professor of Urban Environmental Policy and Environmental Studies at Tufts University, wrote in the Dawn newspaper.\n\"That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.\"\nThe treaty requires India to share hydrological data with Pakistan - crucial for flood forecasting and planning for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.\nPradeep Kumar Saxena, India's former IWT commissioner for over six years, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the country can now stop sharing flood data with Pakistan.\nThe region sees damaging floods during the monsoon season, which begins in June and lasts until September. But Pakistani authorities have said India was already sharing very limited hydrological data.\n\"India was sharing only around 40% of the data even before it made the latest announcement,\" Shiraz Memon, Pakistan's former additional commissioner of the Indus Waters Treaty, told BBC Urdu.\nAnother issue that comes up each time there is water-related tension in the region is if the upstream country can \"weaponise\" water against the downstream country.\nThis is often called a \"water bomb\", where the upstream country can temporarily hold back water and then release it suddenly, without warning, causing massive damage downstream.\nCould India do that?\nExperts say India would first risk flooding its own territory as its dams are far from the Pakistan border. However, it could now flush silt from its reservoirs without prior warning - potentially causing damage downstream in Pakistan.\nHimalayan rivers like the Indus carry high silt levels, which quickly accumulate in dams and barrages. Sudden flushing of this silt can cause significant downstream damage.\nThere's a bigger picture: India is downstream of China in the Brahmaputra basin, and the Indus originates in Tibet.\nIn 2016, after India warned that \"blood and water cannot flow together\" following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which India blamed on Pakistan, China blocked a tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo - that becomes the Brahmaputra in northeast India.\nChina, that has Pakistan as its ally, said they had done it as it was needed for a hydropower project they were building near the border. But the timing of the move was seen as Beijing coming in to help Islamabad. \nAfter building several hydropower plants in Tibet, China has green-lit what will be the world's largest dam on the lower reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo.\nBeijing claims minimal environmental impact, but India fears it could give China significant control over the river's flow.",

        "article_text": "BBC film critics Caryn James and Nicholas Barber pick their cinema highlights of the year so far, from a brutal war epic to an ambitious period vampire drama.\nThe sharpest American indie film of the year so far, Companion stars Jack Quaid and Sophie Thatcher as a devoted young couple who go to stay with some friends in a Russian tycoon's remote forest getaway. (Rupert Friend has a hilarious cameo as the mulleted oligarch.) As a drunken evening of confessions, suspicions and disagreements unfolds, it seems at first if the film might be a romantic comedy, or maybe a noirish thriller about a robbery gone wrong. In fact, Companion is a science-fiction comedy thriller \u2013 but beyond that, the less you know about the film in advance, the more enjoyable its many ingenious twists and turns will be. Suffice it to say that the big-screen debut of writer-director Drew Hancock is a sparklingly entertaining satire on modern technology and the never-more-relevant topic of how entitled and misogynistic certain insecure young men can be. And it packs all of its ideas into 97 minutes. (NB)\nAs stunning as Ryan Coogler's Black Panther was, he has outdone himself with Sinners. Michael B Jordan is slyly convincing as twins named Smoke and Stack, who return from Chicago to their home town in Mississippi, in the Jim Crow South in 1932, to open a juke joint. With huge ambition and imagination, Coogler swirls familiar genres and tropes into a wholly original film that blurs the real and the supernatural. Sinners is a period piece as well as a vampire film. It is a drama about racism, family, superstition and spirituality, and it comes with passionate sex and exhilarating blues music. Coogler directs with brio, at times creating a phantasmagoria in which robed African musicians appear next to rappers. The first hour is so full of texture it could stand alone as a period film, but the supernatural eventually intrudes, leading to a finale of action, blood and vengeance. Jordan is surrounded by a superb supporting cast, including Delroy Lindo, Wunmi Musaku and Hailee Steinfeld.\u00a0 Sex, blues and vampires at the door? What more can anyone want from a film? (CJ)\nMiranda Yousef's riveting documentary tells the stranger-than-fiction story of Thomas Kinkade, one of the biggest-selling artists in history. Critics dismissed his work as nauseatingly sickly, but in the 1990s and 2000s, there were shops all around the US devoted to Kinkade's sentimental pictures of cosy country cottages. Art for Everybody asks fascinating questions about who gets to decide what counts as legitimate art, and whether some paintings can be more moral than others \u2013 questions that resonate today, in light of the continuing culture wars in the US . But Yousef's delicately balanced and sensitive film is just as fascinating on personal issues as it is on sociopolitical ones. A key part of Kinkade's marketing was his carefully constructed public image as a devoutly Christian, all-American family man, and yet the so-called \"Painter of Light\" had a dark side, too. Did the pressures of being a squeaky-clean Dr Jekyll push him into becoming a self-destructive Mr Hyde? (NB)\nAlex Garland, the writer and director of Civil War, and Ray Mendoza, a veteran who was that film's military advisor, have created a harrowing, visceral, real-time drama that recreates an actual battle between Navy Seals and al-Qaeda jihadists. Garland's virtuoso technique and Mendoza's first-hand experience of war blend in a film of uncompromising focus, which plunges us into the intensity of combat without explanation or backstory. Yet the faces of Joseph Quinn, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai are enough to capture the fear and determination of being under siege. Creating characters far from the bravado of typical Hollywood war films, the actors depict courage in battle as a terror-filled endurance test. The film immerses us in that feeling. It is loud and intense, relentless in its barrage of grenades and gunfire, and when the cries of pain from the injured men start, they never stop. Warfare is a dazzling technical achievement but much more. Focusing on the personal cost of combat and violence itself rather than the politics of the Iraq conflict, it reinvents the war film with bracing freshness and immediacy. (CJ)\nBarry Keoghan, Christopher Abbott and Colm Meaney star in this dark and bloody western-style thriller about a feud between sheep farmers in remote rural Ireland. Meaney and Abbott (who speak their dialogue in Irish) play a laconic father and son who lose their two prize rams, only to discover that they have been stolen by their neighbour's shiftless son (Keoghan). Accusations are made, simmering resentments reach boiling point, and violence ensues \u2013 but then Christopher Andrews, the film's debut writer-director, rewinds his story and replays it from a revelatory new perspective. Suddenly, a hard-boiled story of crime and retribution becomes an aching tragedy about desperate economic hardship, youthful stupidity, male pride, and the traumas passed down from taciturn fathers to taciturn sons. Bring Them Down is tough to watch but it's beautifully shot, cleverly plotted and stunningly powerful. (NB)\nAlain Guiraudie's (Stranger by the Lake) engaging film is full of surprises. It starts as a drama about Jeremie, a young man returning to his small village in the lush French countryside for a funeral, then becomes a quietly comic take on desire along with a thriller about covering up a murder. The film deftly carries the audience with it through all these turns. Jeremie is an opportunist but also an enigma. He may have had a passion for his former boss and mentor, the village baker, who died. The baker's widow definitely seems interested in Jeremie, who grew up as the best friend of her son, Vincent; he now angrily suspects Jeremie of wanting to sleep with his mother. Jeremie does not want that but he does find himself in a reluctant affair with the local priest. The joke is that so many people lust after the unremarkable Jeremie, and the suspense comes from the small-town eyes and local police wondering what happened when Vincent mysteriously disappears. Misericordia (Latin for mercy) was nominated for eight Cesar awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars, including film and director, but its human comedy lands easily with audiences everywhere. (CJ)\nDeep in the leafy French countryside, a scruffy teenage layabout Totone (Cl\u00e9ment Faveau) has to look after his younger sister Claire (Luna Garret) after the sudden death of their father. His answer to their dire financial problems? Making award-winning luxury cheese. Louise Courvoisier's debut film is a heart-tugging coming-of-age drama, rooted in the soil of the Jura region where she grew up. She offers an earthy insider's view of how strenuous life can be for agricultural workers, and how wrenching it is when carefree youth turns to relentless, responsible adulthood. But she also fashions a warm, romantic, gorgeously scenic and ultimately hopeful tale of underdogs working together in the sunshine to improve their lives. Blessed are the cheesemakers, as Monty Python once put it. (NB)\nA giant, sloppy Great Dane tugs Naomi Watts around the streets of Manhattan, but by the end of this lovely film about affection and grief the physical comedy with the dog seems the least of it. Watts smoothly play Iris, a creative writing teacher whose best friend, Walter, a famous womanising author, kills himself. He leaves her his dog, Apollo, even though she lives in a one-room apartment in a pet-free building. Dealing with Apollo becomes a way for Iris to grapple with her feelings of love and loss for Walter, played by Bill Murray in flashback scenes filled with such wit and tenderness that they have a great impact in spite of his minimal screen time. Based on Sigrid Nunez's eloquent, acclaimed 2018 novel, the film was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose films include the underrated Montana Story (2021) with Haley Lu Richardson and Owen Teague. Avoiding mawkish clich\u00e9s, they have created a gem of a film that is funny and touching whether you are a pet lover or not. Come for the rambunctious Great Dane, stay for the beautifully rendered emotions. (CJ)\nAardman's two greatest heroes are back \u2013 and so is their sneakiest ever adversary, a diabolical penguin named Feathers McGraw. Directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, the Oscar-nominated Vengeance Most Fowl is chock-full of the qualities that make Wallace & Gromit's farcical adventures so cherished: the painstaking stop-motion claymation, the Heath Robinson-style gadgetry, the winking homages to classic cinema, the gleefully silly British humour, and the deep affection for the characters and their world. Above all, it a treat to see Feathers McGraw, more than 30 years after he was introduced in The Wrong Trousers. But there is more to the Bristol-based studio's new film than the nostalgic whimsy you would expect. When Wallace invents a robotic garden gnome that does all of Gromit's favourite gardening jobs (and that's even before it turns evil), the story takes a canalboat trip into Mission: Impossible territory by addressing fears about artificial intelligence. (NB)\nThe immensely talented director Rungano Nyoni, whose I Am Not a Witch (2017) won a Bafta for outstanding British debut, makes artful, accessible films of great visual panache. Her latest is a clear-eyed drama about cultural and generational conflict. The heroine, Shula, is a cosmopolitan woman recently returned from the city to her village in Zambia. Nyoni conveys this dissonance at once, as Shula drives home from a costume party dressed in a glittery silver helmet and dark glasses (an homage to a Missy Elliott video) and finds her Uncle Fred dead on a dirt road. As the story takes us into the family's traditional funeral rituals, it slowly reveals that Shula and two cousins had been abused by Fred as children, a reality their mothers put aside as they mourn their brother. Nyoni's style is realistic even as she drops in surreal images. The narrative about secrecy and the trauma of sexual assault builds in power right to the end, when Shula recalls a children's television programme and the title of this stunning film finally makes sense.

        "article_text": "The creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.\nWhen news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, had resurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.\nThe story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. \"I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,\" Martin wrote on his blog.\nMartin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.\u00a0\nColossal \u2013 which is currently valued at $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA \u2013 boldly states on its website that it's \"going to fix\" the problem of extinction.\nAccording to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. \"We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,\" James tells the BBC.\u00a0\u00a0\nDe-extinction has been talked about for decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves \u2013 which are actually grey wolves that possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features \u2013 represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.\nIn the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.\nThe BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.\nChief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.\nSuch a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing from international agreements on climate change and revoking measures intended protect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.\n\"It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,\" he says.\nThis worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior \u2013 who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement \u2013 praised the company's work on X as a new \"bedrock for modern species conservation\". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the \"endangered species list\" \u2013 presumably a reference to the Red List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government \u2013 thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. \"Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation \u2013 not regulation \u2013 that has spawned American greatness,\" he wrote.\nBiodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons, according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.\nColossal claims that its de-extinction work will directly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to \"ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list\" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.\nWhile Colossal's de-extinction work is \"super-cool science,\" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.\nColossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats' resilience to climate change through their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.\u00a0\nHowever, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparing carbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forest found the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.\nSome research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they can reduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggests bison and horses could replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained at high densities \u2013 where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans \u2013 to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is also different today than it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.\nThere could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun \u2013 an effect that some research suggests is already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.\u00a0\n\"Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,\" Sekar says. \"It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.\"\u00a0\nJames calls for more research to resolve these questions and show \"direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey\".\nDire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.\nModern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.\n\"That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,\" she says. \"If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.\"\nJulie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as the northern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. \"These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,\" she says.\n\"I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,\" she adds. \"That is unfortunate.\"\nJames at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just \"one piece of a very complex puzzle\" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like \"a giant ship\" pulling \"all these other projects in its wake\".\u00a0\nIt is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. \"What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.\"\u00a0\nThis in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.\nIn the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality \"genetically modified grey wolves\", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.\nBut scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white \"because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones\", Gill says. \"This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.\"\nEven if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. \"A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.\"\nColossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.\nIn the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants \u2013 extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings \u2013 should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer from infertility and lose their calves to stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothers deeply mourn dead calves. \"Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?\" asks Sekar.\nJames says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to \"avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead\".\u00a0\nColossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme \u2013 but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.\nWhile Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being \"the right investment to make\".\nFor every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.\u00a0\nBut while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, their biggest threats are road collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing \"how the animal is going to survive on the ground\", the genetic component becomes \"kind of irrelevant\".\u00a0\nHerpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, , who has reviewed data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around two wild elephants are known to die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.\u00a0\nColossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways to engineer high quality animal proteins for human consumption could, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.\u00a0\n\"Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,\" Sekar says. \"If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Many of McLaren's road-car market rivals, such as Ferrari, Porsche and Lamborghini, are also competing in WEC.\nMcLaren also have a presence in the Formula 1 Academy for aspiring female drivers.\nFormula E is a world championship but it is struggling to maintain a significant public profile and last year Brown said its failure to grow its audience was the series' \"biggest problem\". \nIn addition to that, while Formula E gives brands a chance to trumpet sustainability as a message, the same now applies to F1.\nF1 already uses highly efficient hybrid engines, and from next year the electrical part of the power unit will increase to supply about 50% of the total performance. F1 is also switching to fully sustainable fuels.\nMcLaren is also pushing its sustainability agenda in other areas, for example by producing a circularity handbook, external which was commissioned by governing body the FIA aimed at improving sustainability practices in F1 design and manufacturing. \nBrown said McLaren would look for a new owner for the Formula E team, whose British drivers Taylor Barnard and Sam Bird are fourth and 13th in the championship after the first five rounds.\n\"For now, we are focused on setting this great team up for future success\u00a0by working towards securing a new owner,\" Brown said.\n\"The team has delivered a strong start to the year and we intend to finish the season on a high.\"",

        "article_text": "Ben and Tatiana Woollaston have forged separate careers in snooker\nBen Woollaston shot into the snooker spotlight with his surprising first-round win against Mark Selby at the World Championship.\nIt was a match between friends and practice partners from Leicester, and one that Selby said before the draw he hoped to avoid.\nWhile Selby coughed up what he described as a \"pathetic\" performance to lose 10-8, Woollaston celebrated arguably the best result of his career in what became a post-midnight finish.\nA first win at the famous Crucible theatre has been a long time coming for Woollaston, who is now 37.\nHe has suffered with chronic fatigue in recent years and said he was so sickly he was \"green\" before the final session against Selby.\nBut if the surname rings a bell, then that might not be entirely down to Ben's snooker achievements alone.\nWife Tatiana is one of the sport's leading referees.\nShe is not allowed to take charge of Ben's matches to avoid any possible accusations of a conflict of interest, but has officiated on many of the sport's big occasions and first appeared at the World Championship in 2020.\nTatiana Woollaston is regarded as one of snooker's top referees\nBen Woollaston turned professional at the age of 17, and, as might be expected, found it tough initially to get the wins to stay on tour.\nHe flitted between professional and amateur ranks, but since 2009 has been a fixture on the main tour.\nIt was while in Germany for the Paul Hunter Classic in 2010 that Tatiana, making her way in the game as a European Billiards and Snooker Association referee, first encountered Ben.\nThey married in 2011.\nTatiana later told BBC Sport: \"I had never heard of him.

        "article_text": "The threat to Canada's sovereignty from US President Donald Trump has dominated the election, but the country also faces a challenge from within. Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation.\nStanding in front of a crowd of about 100 squeezed into a small event hall in the city of Lethbridge, Dennis Modry is asking locals about Alberta's future.\nWho thinks Alberta should have a bigger role in Canada, he asks? A dozen or so raise their hands.\nWho thinks the province should push for a split from Canada and form its own nation? About half the crowd raise their hands.\n\"How many people would like Alberta to join the US?\" Another show of support from half the crowd.\nMr Modry, a retired heart surgeon, is a co-leader of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a grassroots organisation pushing for an independence referendum.\nThe possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday's federal election.\nMr Modry told the BBC the separatist movement has grown in recent months - driven in part, he believes, by the president's rhetoric.\n\"We're not interested in that\", he said. \"We're interested in Alberta sovereignty.\"\nJeffrey Rath, however - a lawyer and rancher from Calgary who is another of the project's co-founders - was not as dismissive of Trump's 51st state suggestion. Although he agrees independence is the priority, he could see a future where Alberta joined with the US.\n\"We have a lot more culturally in common with our neighbours to the south in Montana\u2026 [and] with our cousins in Texas, than we do anywhere else,\" he said.\nPreviously on the political fringes, the possibility of a unity crisis is now being discussed out in the open.\nIn an opinion piece for national newspaper the Globe and Mail, Preston Manning - an Albertan considered one of the founders of the modern conservative movement in Canada - warned \"large numbers of Westerners simply will not stand for another four years of Liberal government, no matter who leads it\".\nAccusing the party of mismanaging national affairs and ignoring the priorities of western Canadians, he added: \"A vote for the Carney Liberals is a vote for Western secession \u2013 a vote for the breakup of Canada as we know it.\"\nThis sense of \"western alienation\", a term used to describe the feeling that the region is often overlooked by politicians in Canada's capital, is nothing new. For decades, many in the oil and gas-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskachtewan have bemoaned how they are underrepresented, despite the region's economic significance for the country as a whole.\nThat resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region's economic growth.\nNational polls suggest the Liberals, now under the leadership of Mark Carney, could be headed for their fourth consecutive win come election day on Monday. That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide.\nJudy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote \"yes\" in an independence referendum.\nShe said she didn't see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, as a westerner.\n\"He can come and say 'I'm from Alberta,' but is he?\" Ms Schneider said.\nAn independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated.\nPolitical analysts say the divide will pose a challenge to the country's next prime minister, especially if Carney wins. And even a victory for Calgary-born Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would \"not solve the imbalance that presently exists between the East and the West,\" Mr Modry, the activist, said.\nThat wider sentiment has pushed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who leads the United Conservative Party, to strike her own path in trade talks with the US, while other provincial leaders and the federal government have co-ordinated their efforts closely. She even visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\nIn Canada, Smith has publicly warned of a \"national unity crisis\" if Alberta's demands - which centre around repealing Trudeau-era environmental laws to accelerate oil and gas production - are not met by the new prime minister within six months of the election.\nWhile Smith has dismissed talk of outright separation as \"nonsense\", critics have accused her of stoking the flames at such a consequential time for Canada's future.\nEven those within the separatist movement have different ideas on how best to achieve their goals.\nLorna Guitton, a born-and-bred Albertan and a volunteer with the Alberta Prosperity Project, told the BBC in Lethbridge that her aim was for the province to have a better relationship with the rest of Canada.\nShe described the current union as \"broken\", and believes a referendum, or the threat of it, will give Albertans \"leverage\" in future negotiations with Ottawa.\nBut Ms Guitton also dismissed any notion of it becoming a 51st US state.\n\"They've got enough of their own problems. Why would I want to be part of that?\" she said. \"I would rather be my own independent, sovereign province, or a province with a better deal in Canada.\"\nAt his ranch outside of Calgary in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Mr Rath has a different view. \nAs he tended to his race horses, he spoke of the political and social attitudes of free enterprise and small government that are shared by Albertans and many Americans.\n\"From that perspective, I would see Alberta as being a good fit within the United States,\" he said.\nHe is currently putting together a \"fact-finding\" delegation to travel to Washington DC and bring the movement directly to the Trump administration.\nMany voters in Alberta, however, dismiss the notion of independence altogether, even if they agree that the province has been overlooked.\nSteve Lachlan from Lethbridge agrees the West lacks representation in Ottawa but said: \"We already have separation, and we need to come together.\"\nAnd the Liberals are not entirely shut out from the province. Polls suggest that Alberta may send more Liberal MPs to Ottawa than in 2021, partly due to changing demographics that led to the creation of new ridings in urban Edmonton and Calgary.\nJames Forrester, who lives in the battleground Calgary Centre district, told the BBC he had traditionally voted Conservative but has leaned left in recent years. This time, he will vote Liberal because of the \"Carney factor\".\n\"I feel he's the best guy to deal with Trump,\" he said. As for the separation sentiment: \"I'm not worried about it.\"\n\nAdditional reporting and videos by Eloise Alanna",

        "article_text": "Days after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar at the end of March, killing at least 3,700 people, the country's ruling junta agreed to a halt in its devastating military campaign.\nIt then violated that ceasefire, again and again.\nI went inside rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state for 10 days from mid-April. I witnessed daily violations by the junta, including rocket and mortar attacks which killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters.\nOne of those was Khala, a 45-year-old father killed in a strike by military warplanes, in a place his wife Mala said should have been safe.\nWhen the ceasefire was announced, on 2 April, Mala and Khala sensed an opportunity to return to their home for the first time in years.\nWith their four-year-old child, they headed from the camp where they'd taken refuge to their village, Pekin Coco. They found it abandoned, with buildings shattered from drawn-out fighting. Almost everyone there had moved to farmland further away from the junta's weapons.\nBut as the young family was about to leave Pekin Coco again, their car loaded with their possessions, the shelling started.\n\"We were all at the front of the house. Then, shells landed near us. We hid at the back of the house. But he [Khala] stayed where he was,\" said Mala. \"The artillery shell landed and exploded near him. He died in the place where he thought he was safe.\n\"He was a good man,\" she said and began to cry.\nLater that afternoon, the junta's warplanes attacked a house on the same street, killing four more men.\n\"I hate them,\" Mala said. \"They always attack people without reason. I don't feel safe here. Jet fighters are flying over the sky often but there is no place to hide.\"\nMala is 31 and seven months pregnant. When we spoke she was back in a displaced people's camp, grieving. Her son Zoe, missing his father, wouldn't leave her side.\nBefore the earthquake, Myanmar was in the midst of a nationwide civil war.\nAfter decades of military rule and brutal repression, ethnic groups, along with a new army of young insurgents, brought the dictatorship to crisis point. As much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the resistance.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed, including many children, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The UN says the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, some 2.5 million were already displaced before the quake.\nKarenni, or Kayah, state is far from the earthquake's epicentre. Its remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Its thick jungle provides cover for those who oppose military rule, but it is difficult to get around, the roads are poor and main highways remain in range of the army's guns. Most of the state is now controlled by rebel and armed ethnic groups.\nOn 28 March when the quake hit, there were no reported deaths in Karenni - but the hospitals still filled quickly with people suffering spinal and crush injuries.\nA 30m (100ft) sinkhole had appeared in the forests around the town of Demoso. Locals who heard the ground open up thought it was another air strike. For many weeks, the sinkhole continued to expand with the aftershocks.\nThe UN noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end. The State Administration Council, the ruling junta, has not commented on the alleged violations but has claimed that it was attacked by resistance groups. During the ceasefire all sides in the conflict have reserved the right to respond if attacked.\nDuring my 10 days in Mobeye, Karenni, I witnessed daily attacks by the junta.\nI met Stefano there, a 23-year-old fighting the military dictatorship with the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF).\nHe leads a platoon of young fighters who have set up trenches around the base.\nFrom a dugout just 100m (330ft) from the junta's positions, he explained the army had continued attacks \"using all means\" during the ceasefire - soldiers on the ground, drones and jets.\n\"They usually attack with drones and heavy artillery on this side. When it rains, they advance by taking advantage of the weather.\"\nHe called the ceasefire a \"joke\". \n\"We did not believe the military council from the beginning. We don't believe it now, and we won't believe it in the future.\"\nThe day after we spoke, the military launched a full-scale assault with heavy weapons and men, attacking rebel lines. As we made our way to the front lines, small-arms fire could be heard nearby, along with mortar strikes. The ground was pitted with fresh hits from armed drones.\nNearby lay the corpse of a junta fighter who had tried to breach the rebel positions. The resistance forces say they have suspended all offensive activities during the ceasefire, but they have said they will respond if attacked. Yi Shui, the commander of another resistance group, the Karenni National Army, showed me pictures on his phone. \"When we saw them, we shot them. One of them got hit\" and another ran away, he said.\nAnd again, the military wasn't just targeting the resistance forces. Its rockets hit farmland beyond, killing a 60-year-old woman. We arrived at fields where four rockets had landed, children were playing with the bent metal and shrapnel from the strikes.\nThe injured were taken to local hospitals, which are hidden deep in the jungle to avoid air strikes from junta warplanes.\nIn one, a young fighter was being treated in a wooden ward with a dirt floor. He had a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and was losing a lot of blood.\nThe doctor in charge, 32-year-old Thi Ha Tun, said he'd treated around a dozen patients for war-related injuries since the ceasefire was declared. Two of the patients, resistance fighters, died.\nHe dismissed what he called the junta's lies. \"They only care about their own interests,\" he said. \"They will only care about their own organisation. They will not care about the rest of this country, their own generation, the youth, the children, the elderly, anything.\"\nThe only solution is to keep fighting, he said.\nHigh on a hilltop in the rebel-controlled areas is the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The earthquake brought down the church steeple and part of the roof. The bell from Rome now sits in a temporary cradle. Repairs have been made, but the church will probably need to be rebuilt.\nThey are still feeling the aftershocks here weeks later.\nBut for Father Philip, the local priest, the greatest threat to his congregation, many of whom are the war displaced, comes from above, not below.\n\"No place is safe. When we have jet fighters flying in the sky\u2026 you never know what will come falling from the sky.\"\nBack at the Mobeye front, Stefano and his men pass the hours between attacks, cleaning their weapons and singing songs. \"I can hear the people's prayers, cries, and cries. We will overthrow the dictatorship,\" they sing in unison. They say the only ceasefire they will trust will come with the junta's defeat. \nThe truce will finish at the end of the month, but for most of the people here, it's as if it never existed at all.",

        "article_text": "River's Franco Mastantuono and Boca's Edinson Cavani will likely play key roles on Sunday\nWhen it comes to football derbies, very little comes close to matching the passion, intensity and cultural significance of Argentina's Superclasico between River Plate and Boca Juniors.\nSuperstar players, fanatical fans, regular helpings of drama and the sinister side of the game - the Superclasico has it all.\nOn Sunday, River's 85,000-capacity Mas Monumental stadium will host the 264th Superclasico on matchday 15 of the Torneo Apertura, the first half of the Argentine top-flight season. \nBoca are looking to avenge a 1-0 home defeat in September and clinch top spot in Apertura Zone A, while River need to build momentum before the knockout rounds after a mixed start to the season.\nWhatever the outcome, it promises to be some spectacle.\nNot only are River and Boca local rivals in Buenos Aires, they are the two biggest clubs in Argentina and indeed two of the superpowers in South America. As many as 80% of Argentines support one of the two clubs.\nTheir trophy cabinets match their popularity.\nRiver have 38 top-flight titles and four Copas Libertadores to their name, while Boca have won the league title on 35 occasions and the Libertadores on six, with three of those triumphs coming during a golden age between 2000 and 2003.\nBoth have also counted some of the greatest players of all time among their ranks. \nRiver alumni include Alfredo di Stefano, Enzo Francescoli and Daniel Passarella, while Boca fans have worshipped Carlos Tevez, Juan Roman Riquelme and Diego Maradona.\nThere is naturally a lot at stake on derby day - Boca fans take great pride in the fact they lead River 92 wins to 87 in the overall Superclasico record. But the rivalry goes way beyond 90 minutes on a football pitch.\n\"It is rooted in their origins, or rather their respective foundational myths,\" Argentine football journalist Santi Bauza tells BBC Sport.\nThe close geographical proximity of the clubs when they were founded - River in 1901 and Boca four years later - created tension.\nOne fan is said to have burned the flag of the opposition during one early meeting, while a Superclasico in 1931 was abandoned after 31 minutes because of mass fighting.\nThe schism widened when River Plate - after joining their rivals in the working-class neighbourhood of La Boca - relocated to the well-to-do suburb of Recoleta up the road, then further north to Nunez, where they reside today.\nDeserting their working-class home and spending big on players - the 35,000 pesos (\u00a31,350) fee paid for Bernabe Ferreyra in 1932 set an Argentine transfer record that stood for 20 years - led to River becoming known as 'Los Millonarios'. The Millionaires.\nBy contrast, Boca have always remained in their spiritual home, the famous La Bombonera stadium that is seemingly dropped into the middle of the 'barrio', a high-poverty district of the city.\nTheir Italian immigrant, working-class roots are a central part of their identity. Little shows this more than the club's nickname 'Xeneize', which comes from the Ligurian dialect word for Genoese.\nA Superclasico without some sort of scuffle does not feel like a Superclasico\nThe division between the clubs is reflected on the pitch in both playing styles and full-blooded encounters.\n\"River have traditionally favoured a more aesthetic brand of football, with their more demanding fans barely even celebrating hard-fought or undeserved wins,\" explains Bauza. \nRiver fans often speak of the three Gs - Gustar (to play well), Ganar (to win) and Golear (to score lots of goals).\n\"Our club is known for its beautiful style of play, excellent ball control, an attacking mindset, and a philosophy that sees attacking the opposition's goal as the best form of defence,\" River club president Jorge Brito tells BBC Sport.\nThat mentality is juxtaposed by the popular Boca motto 'transpira a la camiseta', which means to 'make the shirt sweat'. Passion and fight are non-negotiable.\n\"Boca pride themselves in being a win-at-all-costs kind of side,\" says Bauza.\n\"Over the years they have both become so massive and ubiquitous in Argentine society that the rich-poor narrative doesn't hold up as much now, but they are still largely identified by those footballing philosophies.\"\nInsult culture in Argentina has given rise to some incredibly petty nicknames.\nSince throwing away a half-time lead to lose to Penarol in the 1966 Copa Libertadores final, Boca fans have called River 'Gallinas' - 'little chickens'.\nIn a 2004 Superclasico, Boca striker Carlos Tevez was sent off for performing a chicken dance in celebration.\nBoca are known as 'Los Bosteros' - 'the manure handlers' - as a factory that used horse manure to make bricks once stood behind La Bombonera. Opposition players have been known to hold their noses when entering the pitch.\nBoca's La Bombonera stadium often shakes during matches\nArgentina is obsessed with football, so it is no surprise that meetings between its two biggest clubs are seismic events.\n\"The Superclasico stops the country in its tracks,\" says Bauza.\n\"Regardless of their form or success, it's always a game that defines the mood of players, managers, pundits and fans alike.\n\"Storylines can emerge or change overnight depending on what happens.\"\nOne of the main highlights of the Superclasico is actually what happens in the stands rather than on the pitch.\nGiant tifos and choreographed displays are common, singing is non-stop and the atmosphere is spine-tingling.\nBut there is a dark side to the world's most intense derby.\nThe Barras Brava - a gang-like organised fan group - rule the terraces in Argentina and have huge influence over club issues like ticketing, merchandising and car parking.\nRiver Plate's Mas Monumental stadium can accommodate 85,000 people after expansion\nAlthough they bring the noise and passion that makes Argentine football so special, their intrinsic links to organised crime, violence and homicide can make stadiums dangerous places.\nWhen River were relegated to the second division in 2011 for the first time in their history, the players were locked inside the dressing room for three hours while fans rioted and burned parts of El Monumental.\nIn 2015 Boca were thrown out of the Libertadores when the River squad were sprayed with pepper spray when emerging for the second half.\nThe second leg of the 2018 Libertadores final - the highest-profile game in Superclasico history - was postponed after police tear gas, used to disperse River fans who had smashed windows on the Boca bus with projectiles as it sped towards Mas Monumental, affected the visiting players.\nThe competition - named after those who liberated South America from Spanish rule - was concluded in Madrid.\nWhile River are assured of a place in the last 16 of the Apertura and top their Libertadores group, a mixture of pre-season squad upheaval and injuries have contributed to an inconsistent start to the year.\nBut beat Boca on Sunday and everything will look a lot rosier.\n\"It is always special. This game is the one you wait for, and nothing else matters when it comes to how it feels to win or lose against them,\" says journalist and River fan Andres Bruckner.\nWhile Boca have had a week to prepare, River flew more than six hours to Ecuador for a 2-2 draw with Independiente del Valle in the Libertadores on Wednesday.\n\"I always think we will win, but playing Libertadores midweek makes things tricky,\" says Bruckner.\n\"In moments like these, with so many doubts, a defeat would put a great question mark over all the players, and supporters will show anger.\"\nWith 85,000 fans now able to cram into the recently expanded Mas Monumental, the pressure to win has never been greater.\n\"I wouldn't mind losing five games in a row if we get the win on Sunday,\" admits broadcaster and River fan Juan Igal. \n\"Boca is the thing I hate the most, and seeing the sadness in their fans and players makes me happy.\"\nRiver Plate won the most recent Superclasico, a 1-0 victory at Boca's La Bombonera in September\nWith many of the players responsible for River's success in recent years now moved on - the sales of Julian Alvarez and Claudio Echeverri to Manchester City typify the struggle of Argentine clubs to retain their best young talent - manager Marcelo Gallardo has placed a lot of faith in 17-year-old starlet Franco Mastantuono.\nBoca started the season poorly - they won just one of their opening four Apertura games and were eliminated in the Libertadores qualifiers - but nine wins in their last 10 league games have sent them three points clear at the top of the table.\nCarlos Palacios and Kevin Zenon have stood out for Boca this season, while the likes of Edinson Cavani and Luis Advincula provide experience and relative calm.\n\"Boca fans die for every game, but we live for Copa Libertadores nights and Superclasicos. It's a game unlike any other,\" says Rodrigo Azurmendi, Boca fan and co-host of the Boca in English Podcast.\n\"Winning means going all out on the jokes, the memes and the folklore against our friends on the other side. Losing means skipping work on Monday.\"\nFor some, the idea of defeat on Sunday is too much to bear. \n\"I can't think about losing, I just don't have it in me,\" Boca fan Rob Smith says.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office.\n\"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April.\nDoge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce.\nBBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.\nOur analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up.\nIn October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from \"cutting fraud and waste\" by the end of the next financial year in 2026. \nThe US federal budget for the last financial year was $6.75tn.\nDoge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.\nHowever, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings.\nWe downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases. \nOur analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence. \nUS media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract which in fact had a total value of $8m.\nDoge says it is working to upload all receipts in a \"digestible and transparent manner\" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts \"representing around 30% of all total savings\". It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\".\nBBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached.\nThe department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated.\nFor three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government.\nThe documents show a contract's start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent.\nDavid Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution. \n\"FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,\" he says.\n\"For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that's going to cost - so when a price is set, it's not a definite price but rather an upper limit.\"\nSo if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending.\nDoge's largest listed individual saving is $2.9bn. \nIt comes from cancelling a contract - which started in 2023 under President Biden - for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children.\nDoge appears to have taken the \"total contract value\" until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2.9bn figure. \nBut the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed.\nA source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge's figure is \"based on speculative, never-used figures\" and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required.\n\"In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount. The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million\", they estimated.\nThey say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review.\nThey also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement  - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased.\nWe contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back.\nThe second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1.9bn.\nThe document which Doge links to has a total contract value of $1.9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0.\nHowever, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract.\nHe said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion.\nThe contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031.\nHowever, Centennial Technologies' CEO told the New York Times that the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration. \nThe company did not respond to our requests for further comment.\nAnother IT contract, this time with the Department of Defense, is the third largest claimed saving.\nDoge says $1.76bn was saved by cancelling a contract with an IT services company called A1FEDIMPACT. \nOn the contract document, the total value is listed as $2.4bn. An online database of government contracts called Higher Gov says this amount was the ceiling value.\nAgain, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated.\nIt is unclear where Doge's figure of $1.76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it.\nThe fourth largest claimed saving of $1.75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines.\nDoge links to a page on USASpending.gov. It shows a grant was paid to Gavi in three instalments, during the Biden administration, totalling $880m.\nGavi confirmed that $880m had been paid out by USAID but said it had not been told the grant had been terminated.\n\"Gavi has not received a termination notice related to this grant,\" a spokesperson told us.\nWe have not found any evidence for the $1.75bn saving claimed by Doge, and a source familiar with the contract said it was unclear where it comes from.\nWe asked the USAID Office of Inspector General about the grant but it did not respond to us.\nWhile Doge may have cut a significant amount of government spending, the lack of evidence provided for its biggest claimed savings makes it impossible to independently confirm exactly how much.\nDoge does not have a press office but BBC Verify has contacted the White House to ask for more evidence of these claimed savings. \nAdditional reporting by Ned Davies and Alison Benjamin.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

She was 44.\nCaliente had served as a judge on the show's Philippines spin-off, and also appeared in the hit US TV series Pose.\n\"Her talent, truth, and impact will never be forgotten, and her legacy will continue to slay - always,\" the official RuPaul's Drag Race account said on X.\nBorn in the Philippines in 1980, Caliente moved to the Queens neighbourhood of New York City with her family when she was a child.\nShe quickly became a fan favourite on RuPaul's Drag Race for her sense of humour and memorable interactions with other queens, when she appeared on the show in 2012.\nShe also appeared on TV sitcoms like Broad City and Search Party, and played the role of Veronica in the TV drama Pose. \nIn 2021, she returned for the show's All Stars season looking more polished and confident. \"Did someone order a GLOW UP?\" she said in an Instagram post at that time, with Tagalog hashtags declaring her Philippine pride.\nFellow Filipina-American Drag Race Star Manila Luzon said she was heartbroken to have lost her best friend of 25 years. \n\"Rest in peace, little sis. Your mug is still flawless,\" said Luzon, who was a runner up on the US series' third season.\nSeason 3 winner Raja, who is Indonesian, also posted a picture of Caliente on Instagram, saying she was at a loss for words.\n\"I trust I will have words soon. I'm at a loss.\" \nDrag Race judge Michelle Visage said: \"My jiggles\u2026. The laughter was endless, our talks were special, your energy was contagious.

She lived her life exactly how she wanted to\u2014 never taking a moment of it for granted,\" said Jinkx Monsoon, who won Season 5 and the all-winners All Stars season. \nCaliente had said that she got her name form Jigglypuff, a pink and cuddly Pokemon character. Caliente means hot in Spanish.\nOn Drag Race Philippines, Caliente is billed as \"RuGirl from Laguna,\" in a nod to her roots in Laguna, an industrial province south of Manila.\n\"Ate Bianca, Jiggly, I hope you know that you are loved,\" said the franchise's breakout star, Marina Summers, using a term of endearmeant in Tagalog.\n\"I just lost my favourite seatmate. Drag Race Philippines will never be the same without you,\" said fellow Drag Race Philippines judge Jervi Wrightson, also known as Kaladkaren.\nCaliente's death comes as Drag Race Philippines is set to air its first All Stars season dubbed Slaysian Royale.

Lewis Ludlam beat Ben Hammersley to a grubber kick for the third after a fine passing move, before Harris went in after Tomos Williams, Christian Wade and Ruan Ackermann linked up to set up the Scotland centre.\nExeter's defence continued to struggle as Seb Atkinson strode through a massive gap 22 metres out to go in under the posts for the fifth try after 26 minutes, and it was just as tepid three minutes later when Anscombe got the sixth.\nIt took 32 minutes for Exeter to get into Gloucester's red zone as Paul Brown-Bampoe went close before Exeter lost the ball, although a minute later Josh Hodge at least got his side on the scoreboard when he raced in from 22 metres.\nBut once again Exeter's defence melted as Williams' lovely looping pass started a move that the Welsh scrum-half got on the end of for the seventh try shortly before half-time.\nExeter made five changes five minutes into the second period, but a minute later went further behind when Wade raced on to pick up his own chipped kick and was stopped just short of the Exeter line, only for Ford-Robinson to dot down from an inch or two out a few phases later.\nWade edged closer to the all-time Premiership try record when his chipped kick was gathered by Carreras, before the Argentine full-back gave it back for his 90th try in the league, and Atkinson got his second soon after when Carreras shook off a tackle from Brown-Bampoe to race in from distance to make it 60-7.\nIt continued to get embarrassing for the former European champions as Singleton broke off a lineout maul for the 11th try, 18 minutes into the second half, and the replacement hooker dotted down in the corner five minutes later when Gloucester broke the 70-point mark for the first time in a Premiership match.\nWhen Exeter did think they had scored a try it was ruled out for a forward pass, as Hodge was denied shortly after Singleton's second score, with Exeter's Will Haydon-Wood sin-binned for a tackle off the ball moments later.\nFrom the resulting penalty Gloucester kicked out the corner and Singleton was mauled in for his third try to take it to 79-7 with 11 minutes left, before Will Rigg and Haydon-Wood scored two late consolation tries for a shell-shocked Exeter side.\nGloucester head coach George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucester:\n\"It's obviously a good day for us. The most pleasing thing for me is the balance of the tries was good.\n\"We've had a tough couple of weeks away from home and we didn't feel the balance of our game was quite right.\n\"But I thought today the boys used the maul well, they used the scrum well and when we attacked we looked really good and our defence as very good as well.\n\"Whilst we're a really good attacking team, we have to have the balance of the game to compete.\"\nExeter head coach Rob Hunter told BBC Radio Devon:\n\"In my many years as a coach that is my lowest point.\n\"You can't put any gloss at all on that.

        "article_text": "Canadians will cast their ballots on Monday in a pivotal election that has been completely transformed by US President Donald Trump.\nThe Conservatives appeared certain to win any contest by a landslide at the start of the year, until Trump's tariffs and barbs about making Canada the \"51st state\" upended the country's politics and injected fresh life into Mark Carney's Liberal Party.\nThe final polls suggest the Liberals are slightly ahead, although the race has tightened in the past week and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre says his party can win.\nThe 36-day campaign ended on a sombre note as party leaders responded to the Saturday evening car ramming that killed 11 people in Vancouver.\nCarney, the incumbent prime minister, cancelled a stop in Hamilton on Sunday morning to address the nation following the attack, which saw an SUV ram into a crowd gathered for a local Filipino festival.\nPoilievre, meanwhile, added a campaign stop in Mississauga, a Toronto suburb, to speak with members of the Filipino community there.\nLater in the day, Carney held a spree of events in three provinces - Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia - in a final push to get out the vote in western Canada, where the Conservatives have more support.\nTrump's decision to impose 25% tariffs on America's northern neighbour and his repeated threats to annex the country as the \"51st state\" fanned deep anger as well as feelings of Canadian nationalism. It led hockey fans to boo the US national anthem before games, a sign of just how suddenly decades of stable US-Canada relations had been shaken.\nThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed by many as a referendum on how Canada should approach the man fresh into his second term in the White House.\nDuring campaign stops, Carney, 60, often spoke of the need to counter an existential threat from President Trump, who he said was \"trying to break us so the US can own us\".\nHe positioned himself as best fit to lead the country through the present crisis, leaning on his experience as the former central banker for Canada during the Great Recession and for the UK at the Bank of England during Brexit.\nAt a campaign stop in Saskatoon on Sunday, Carney said Canada should strengthen its ties with other \"reliable trade partners\" like the UK and the European Union. Earlier in the election, he said the old relationship that Canada had enjoyed with the US for decades was \"over\".\nMeanwhile, Conservative leader Poilievre made his final stops in Ontario where polls indicate his party is trailing behind. The populous province is home to 122 seats in Parliament out of 343 that could alter the outcome of the election. A party must win 172 seats to have a majority government. The Liberals currently hold 152 seats, the most of any party, but they would have to pick up a significant number of seats to control the House of Commons.\nMuch of Poilievre's messaging has centred on what he has called the \"lost Liberal decade\" under the leadership of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who stepped down earlier this year when his party was ailing in the polls.\nThe Conservative leader frequently drew upon frustrations with soaring housing costs, unaffordability and crime to pitch himself as the change that Canadians need.\n\"We need to vote for change so you can afford food and homes,\" he told supporters at a campaign stop in Peterborough, a city north-east of Toronto.\nAnd with the election shaping up as a race between the Conservatives and the Liberals, smaller parties have struggled to gain traction.\nThe left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, faces the prospect of losing a number of seats as it trails behind the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which runs candidates only in the French-speaking province of Quebec.\nSingh cancelled a number of campaign events on Sunday in light of the deadly attack in Vancouver. The NDP leader, who is running for re-election in a Vancouver-area riding, was meeting supporters at the Lapu Lapu festival minutes before the attack. He appeared visibly emotional when he spoke to the media afterwards.\nThroughout the election, Singh called on Canadians to vote for his party's candidates so they can act as a check on power in Ottawa. \nThe Bloc has also struggled, with fears over Trump's threats and Canada's future fuelling anxiety throughout the country and pushing voters towards the bigger federal parties.\nHistorically, Canada has only been led by Liberal or Conservative governments. \nWhile President Trump has been a central figure to Canada's election, he has steered clear of commenting on its outcome.\nBut the Trump administration has continued its rhetoric on taking over Canada. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that \"the president has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state\".\nPolls will open at 08:30 local time on Monday in Newfoundland and Labrador (12:00 GMT). The election will span across six time zones, with the last polls closing in British Columbia at 19:00 PST (03:00 GMT on Tuesday). \nA record number of Canadians - more than 7 million - have already cast their ballots in advance.",

It led hockey fans to boo the US national anthem before games, a sign of just how suddenly decades of stable US-Canada relations had been shaken.Watch: The \u2018Trump effect\u2019 and other things to watch for as Canada votesThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed by many as a referendum on how Canada should approach the man fresh into his second term in the White House.During campaign stops, Carney, 60, often spoke of the need to counter an existential threat from President Trump, who he said was \"trying to break us so the US can own us\".Follow the latest Canada election news hereHe positioned himself as best fit to lead the country through the present crisis, leaning on his experience as the former central banker for Canada during the Great Recession and for the UK at the Bank of England during Brexit.At a campaign stop in Saskatoon on Sunday, Carney said Canada should strengthen its ties with other \"reliable trade partners\" like the UK and the European Union. The Liberals currently hold 152 seats, the most of any party, but they would have to pick up a significant number of seats to control the House of Commons.Much of Poilievre's messaging has centred on what he has called the \"lost Liberal decade\" under the leadership of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who stepped down earlier this year when his party was ailing in the polls.The Conservative leader frequently drew upon frustrations with soaring housing costs, unaffordability and crime to pitch himself as the change that Canadians need.",

        "article_text": "In the midst of \"the car capital of the world\", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.\nHome to the \"Motor City\" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called \"the car capital of the world\". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch.

Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky.

The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole.\n\"California isn't just keeping pace with the world - we're setting the pace,\" Newsom said.\nThe new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump's tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state's economy. \nCalifornia has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world's entertainment industry and the country's two largest seaports. \nNewsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028, filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade. \nTrump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. \nAnother 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy. \nTrump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nNewsom noted his worries about the future of the state's economy. \n\"While we celebrate this success, we recognise that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration,\" he said. \"California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected.\"\nTrump has argued his trade war is only levelling the playing field after years of the US being taken advantage of. \nThe tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. It is one major pillar of his economic agenda, as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nThe new data shows California's GDP behind the US at $29.18 trillion, China at $18.74 trillion and Germany at $4.65 trillion. It also shows California was the fastest growing among those countries.\nJapan's economy is under pressure because of its decreasing and ageing population, which means its workforce is shrinking and social care costs are ballooning. \nThis week, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for Japan and projected that  the central bank would raise interest rates more slowly than previously expected because of the impact of higher tariffs.\n\"The effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above-inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income,\" its World Economic Outlook report said.",

        "article_text": "The creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.\nWhen news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, had resurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.\nThe story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. \"I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,\" Martin wrote on his blog.\nMartin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.\u00a0\nColossal \u2013 which is currently valued at $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA \u2013 boldly states on its website that it's \"going to fix\" the problem of extinction.\nAccording to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. \"We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,\" James tells the BBC.\u00a0\u00a0\nDe-extinction has been talked about for decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves \u2013 which are actually grey wolves that possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features \u2013 represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.\nIn the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.\nThe BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.\nChief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.\nSuch a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing from international agreements on climate change and revoking measures intended protect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.\n\"It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,\" he says.\nThis worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior \u2013 who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement \u2013 praised the company's work on X as a new \"bedrock for modern species conservation\". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the \"endangered species list\" \u2013 presumably a reference to the Red List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government \u2013 thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. \"Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation \u2013 not regulation \u2013 that has spawned American greatness,\" he wrote.\nBiodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons, according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.\nColossal claims that its de-extinction work will directly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to \"ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list\" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.\nWhile Colossal's de-extinction work is \"super-cool science,\" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.\nColossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats' resilience to climate change through their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.\u00a0\nHowever, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparing carbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forest found the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.\nSome research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they can reduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggests bison and horses could replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained at high densities \u2013 where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans \u2013 to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is also different today than it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.\nThere could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun \u2013 an effect that some research suggests is already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.\u00a0\n\"Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,\" Sekar says. \"It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.\"\u00a0\nJames calls for more research to resolve these questions and show \"direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey\".\nDire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.\nModern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.\n\"That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,\" she says. \"If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.\"\nJulie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as the northern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. \"These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,\" she says.\n\"I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,\" she adds. \"That is unfortunate.\"\nJames at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just \"one piece of a very complex puzzle\" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like \"a giant ship\" pulling \"all these other projects in its wake\".\u00a0\nIt is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. \"What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.\"\u00a0\nThis in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.\nIn the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality \"genetically modified grey wolves\", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.\nBut scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white \"because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones\", Gill says. \"This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.\"\nEven if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. \"A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.\"\nColossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.\nIn the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants \u2013 extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings \u2013 should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer from infertility and lose their calves to stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothers deeply mourn dead calves. \"Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?\" asks Sekar.\nJames says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to \"avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead\".\u00a0\nColossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme \u2013 but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.\nWhile Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being \"the right investment to make\".\nFor every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.\u00a0\nBut while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, their biggest threats are road collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing \"how the animal is going to survive on the ground\", the genetic component becomes \"kind of irrelevant\".\u00a0\nHerpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, , who has reviewed data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around two wild elephants are known to die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.\u00a0\nColossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways to engineer high quality animal proteins for human consumption could, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.\u00a0\n\"Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,\" Sekar says. \"If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Stars from the reality television show Love On The Spectrum went on the defensive  after Robert F Kennedy Jr commented that people with autism make limited contributions to society. \nPeople with autism \"will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go on a date\", the US Health and Human Services chief said earlier this month.\nThe remarks drew widespread anger from people with autism who reject the notion of needing to be repaired, but also responses from those pushing for a greater understanding of autism.\n\"Autistic people have the same hopes, dreams and yes, the same awkward dating moments as anyone else,\" Dani Bowman, one of the television show's star's said to US media. \nThe reality TV star on the show, which is about a group of autistic adults' experiences dating, said Kennedy's comments were \"completely false\". \nSince joining the Trump administration, Kennedy, who in the past has promoted debunked theories suggesting autism is linked to vaccines, has made autism a main focus. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThat rise is, at least in part, attributable to increased autism awareness and an expanding definition of the disorder, scientists say. First recognized as a developmental disorder in 1978, autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that symptoms vary by person. Some need little to no support in their daily lives, while others need a great amount. \nEarlier this month, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. He did not give details on the project or funding it. He also said his department would investigate potential causes.\n\"Everything is on the table - our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic,\" Kennedy later told Fox News. \nExperts have warned that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder will not be straightforward, and called the effort misguided and unrealistic.\nThe idea of curing autism is concerning for some.\n\"Wanting to cure autism implies that our way of being is wrong and it isn't,\" Ms Bowman told NewsNation. \"We don't need to be fixed. We need to be supported. But the answer isn't erasing autism, it's building a more inclusive world for all of us.\"\nAnother star of Love on the Spectrum, James B Jones, attacked Kennedy's autism remarks on social media, calling them \"extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive\".\nBut not everyone agrees. \nWhile advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion they avoid \"uncomfortable truths about children like mine\", Emily May, who has a child with autism, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Friday.\n\"I have no interest in defending Mr. Kennedy, whose shaky science and conspiracy theories will do nothing to benefit those with autism and their families,\" Ms May said.  \"And yet, I think his remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation around the condition.\"\nOne of Kennedy's main false claims was that \"autism comes from vaccines\". Although he has denied many times that  he is anti-vaccination and said he and his children are vaccinated, he has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.\nThe theory came from a study by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, but it was later retracted by the Lancet medical journal. Multiple studies since have concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.\nDespite her frustration, Ms May expressed admiration for Kennedy's \"willingness to speak frankly about the painful parts of [her] child's life\".\nAutism Speaks, an advocacy organisation, agreed in part with Ms May. \nThe organisation said it heard from parents who felt Kennedy's comments resonated \"with their lived experience\". \n\"The language we use matters,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement to the BBC. \"It should reflect current science and honor the lived experiences of autistic people, many of whom lead fulfilling lives and make invaluable contributions to their families, workplaces and communities.\"\nDr Manish Arora, founder of LinusBio who has spent more than two decades studying autism, noted that Kennedy's statements can be \"very hurtful for families and autistic individuals\". \nBut he also welcomed more research into the causes of autism and said increased attention is a \"meaningful opportunity\". \nStill, he wishes the debate was \"less polarising\". \n\"Scientists should see the opportunity here, avoid the polarised discourse and see the opportunities here,\" Dr Arora told the BBC. \nJake Tilk, and his brother, Max Tilk, who is on the autism spectrum, largely avoid that political discourse in their social media videos where they share what their day-to-day life looks. \nThey share their lives online to create awareness and acceptance of autism, because the brothers want to celebrate neurodiversity, Jake Tilk told the BBC. \n\"It's most important that discussions about autism are grounded in science, compassion and most importantly the living experiences of people with autism themselves,\" he said.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nJose Mourinho v Pep Guardiola: How Jose became 'The Dark Lord'\nWhen Inter Milan drew Barcelona in the semi-finals of the 2009-10 Champions League, few backed the Italian side to progress against Pep Guardiola's world-beaters.\nBoth were chasing their own piece of history. Barcelona were trying to become the first team to claim back-to-back titles in the Champions League era while Inter were seeking a first European Cup final since 1972 and a first win in the competition since 1965.\nIt was a tie tinged with bitterness, with Inter boss Jose Mourinho going up against Guardiola, who had worked together at Barca but were now intense rivals.\nIt was a tie that defined Mourinho as a coach and ultimately saw him lead Inter to the Treble - the first Italian side to achieve such a feat - as they wrapped up the Serie A title, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League.\nAnd on 28 April 2010, he and Inter took a mighty leap towards that historic achievement.\nFifteen years on from the captivating second leg in Barcelona and with the two preparing to face each other in another Champions League semi-final, BBC Sport takes a look at the story of that fascinating tie.\nTension had been brewing long before the players set foot on the pitch.\nIn the summer of 2008, Barcelona were looking for a new manager, having sacked 2006 Champions League winner Frank Rijkaard.\nThe choice was Mourinho or Guardiola, who had worked closely with the Portuguese during the 1990s when he was Sir Bobby Robson's assistant and the Spain midfielder was Barca's captain.\nIt was a position Mourinho had acquired having first started out as an interpreter for Robson at Sporting, before evolving into an assistant coach. He followed Robson to Porto then Barca.\nBut while in Catalonia, the Portuguese was disgruntled with his treatment. \nHe was nicknamed 'the translator' and felt he was not taken seriously.\nWhen it came to Barca appointing a new coach a decade later, Mourinho - who by then boasted Champions League and Premier League titles on his CV - was shunned in favour of Guardiola, who had just finished his first year in management with Barca's reserves.\nIt was a decision that did not sit well with Mourinho and had a profound impact on the way he would go on to set up his teams, sacrificing pretty football - like Guardiola's tiki-taka - in favour of efficiency a solid defence.\nBarca's decision instigated a managerial rivalry between Mourinho and Guardiola that came to a head in 2010 in the tie and was later ramped up while the former was at Real Madrid.\nHow to Win the Champions League\nJose Mourinho\nMourinho's 'the translator' nickname returned in mocking tribute in the build-up to the first leg at San Siro.\nThe feeling was that Mourinho did not stand a chance against a Guardiola team at the height of its power, having won the Treble the previous season.\nAlready rife with drama and a gripping narrative, the first leg was played under a cloud of ash following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull. \nIt meant Barca could not fly to Italy and instead had to take a 10-hour bus journey.\nWhether that had any bearing on the match is impossible to know. But it certainly gave an already intriguing tie an air of theatre.\n\"When you get to the knockouts against a team like Barcelona, you have to win your match at home,\" said Mourinho in a new BBC Sport documentary - How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho.\nThat is of course easier said than done with Guardiola's illustrious squad including Lionel Messi, Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who Barca had acquired from Inter in a swap deal that season with striker Samuel Eto'o.\n\"Before the first leg, Mourinho told me 'you're going to play left-back and you will mark Messi',\" recalls former Inter defender Javier Zanetti in the documentary.\n\"I knew Messi from the Argentina team and he was the best player in the world. I followed Messi around and in every zone he went into, two of my team-mates came to pressure him to deny him space to make a difference.\"\nMourinho's tactics worked and Inter bounced back from an early Pedro goal as Wesley Sneijder levelled before the break then Maicon and Diego Milito assured a 3-1 victory at a rocking San Siro.\n\"It could have been more. A fantastic performance,\" said Mourinho.\nListen: How to Win the Champions League - Jose Mourinho\nHow rejection fuelled Mourinho's second Champions League triumph\nBarcelona fans unveiled a banner which read 'comeback' in Catalan at the semi-final second leg at the Nou Camp\nSo to the second leg.\nWith a two-goal advantage to protect, Inter needed to produce a defensive masterclass to prevent Guardiola's men, backed by their expectant supporters, overturning the deficit.\nThe players emerged from the Nou Camp tunnel to be greeted by a banner printed simply with the word 'remuntada' - comeback in Catalan.\n\"I think that put the pressure on them [Barcelona] because everyone believed they could do it,\" said Zanetti.\nMourinho's style of play is synonymous with a solid defence, and it was something he relied on that night in Spain. That and a number of top, experienced players.\n\"At Inter, my bench was full of top players at the end of their careers. [Ivan] Cordoba, [Francesco] Toldo, [Marco] Materazzi, [Dejan] Stankovic. They were not my first choices, but they were my big allies,\" Mourinho said.\nHe recalled a speech made before the match by defender Cordoba in the dressing room.\n\"He was saying 'this is my dream, this is my last opportunity. I am not playing because of him [Mourinho]. He decided to put me on the bench and decided to play you. So you are going to play for me',\" Mourinho said.\n\"When you have this kind of person on the bench and in the dressing room, your work becomes much more easy. I knew that they would do anything for me and I would have done anything for them.\"\nInter's task became much harder in the 28th minute when midfielder Thiago Motta was sent off for catching Busquets in the face as he raised a hand when defending the ball.\nBusquets rolled around on the ground with his hands clutching his face, stopping momentarily to move his hands in a 'peekaboo' gesture to ensure the referee had produced a red card.\nThe Brazilian's reaction following the dismissal, man-handling Busquets in protest, only fanned the flames of a high-octane encounter.\n\"We went there with a strategy to try to control, to try and bite in counter-attack,\" said Mourinho.\n\"After 20 minutes or so Motta is sent off. People are sometimes afraid to speak about it, I am never afraid to speak about it - the referee's decisions are always crucial.\"\nDown to 10 men and with a 90,000-strong crowd willing their opponents on, Inter sat deep and flooded their defensive areas while the hosts' passing game was typically brilliant but failed to find the gaps.\n\"During half-time he [Mourinho] was still convinced we would reach the final. His confidence was contagious,\" said Zanetti.\nAnd, having already dubbed himself The Special One, Mourinho felt confident he had his tactics spot on.\n\"To play with 10 players against Barcelona, it becomes epic. You need heroes. You need to have the best out of everybody,\" said Mourinho.\n\"I think I was brilliant in the way I organised the team. We defended with everything we had. We defended with hearts, with souls.

        "summary": "Barcelona were trying to become the first team to claim back-to-back titles in the Champions League era while Inter were seeking a first European Cup final since 1972 and a first win in the competition since 1965.It was a tie tinged with bitterness, with Inter boss Jose Mourinho going up against Guardiola, who had worked together at Barca but were now intense rivals.It was a tie that defined Mourinho as a coach and ultimately saw him lead Inter to the Treble - the first Italian side to achieve such a feat - as they wrapped up the Serie A title, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League.And on 28 April 2010, he and Inter took a mighty leap towards that historic achievement.Fifteen years on from the captivating second leg in Barcelona and with the two preparing to face each other in another Champions League semi-final, BBC Sport takes a look at the story of that fascinating tie.The Special One v the king of tiki-takaTension had been brewing long before the players set foot on the pitch.In the summer of 2008, Barcelona were looking for a new manager, having sacked 2006 Champions League winner Frank Rijkaard.The choice was Mourinho or Guardiola, who had worked closely with the Portuguese during the 1990s when he was Sir Bobby Robson's assistant and the Spain midfielder was Barca's captain.It was a position Mourinho had acquired having first started out as an interpreter for Robson at Sporting, before evolving into an assistant coach. So you are going to play for me',\" Mourinho said. \"When you get to the knockouts against a team like Barcelona, you have to win your match at home,\" said Mourinho in a new BBC Sport documentary - How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho.That is of course easier said than done with Guardiola's illustrious squad including Lionel Messi, Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who Barca had acquired from Inter in a swap deal that season with striker Samuel Eto'o. You need to have the best out of everybody,\" said Mourinho. One more and they would level the tie and progress to the final thanks to their away goal in Milan.Bojan Krkic thought he had secured victory after he broke free in the Inter box and lashed into the roof of the net in injury time.But the Nou Camp's joy was short-lived as the referee gave handball against Yaya Toure in the build-up and the match finished 1-0, with Inter progressing to the final to face Bayern Munich.The full-time whistle had barely sounded before Mourinho sprinted onto the pitch, one arm in the air, to celebrate with his players.Barcelona chose that moment to put the sprinklers on.An attempt to annoy the Inter players and stop them from celebrating on the pitch?",

        "article_text": "In the midst of \"the car capital of the world\", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.\nHome to the \"Motor City\" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called \"the car capital of the world\". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office.\n\"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April.\nDoge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce.\nBBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.\nOur analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up.\nIn October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from \"cutting fraud and waste\" by the end of the next financial year in 2026. \nThe US federal budget for the last financial year was $6.75tn.\nDoge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.\nHowever, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings.\nWe downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases. \nOur analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence. \nUS media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract which in fact had a total value of $8m.\nDoge says it is working to upload all receipts in a \"digestible and transparent manner\" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts \"representing around 30% of all total savings\". It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\".\nBBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached.\nThe department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated.\nFor three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government.\nThe documents show a contract's start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent.\nDavid Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution. \n\"FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,\" he says.\n\"For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that's going to cost - so when a price is set, it's not a definite price but rather an upper limit.\"\nSo if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending.\nDoge's largest listed individual saving is $2.9bn. \nIt comes from cancelling a contract - which started in 2023 under President Biden - for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children.\nDoge appears to have taken the \"total contract value\" until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2.9bn figure. \nBut the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed.\nA source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge's figure is \"based on speculative, never-used figures\" and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required.\n\"In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount.

        "article_text": "In the midst of \"the car capital of the world\", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.\nHome to the \"Motor City\" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called \"the car capital of the world\". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia.\nOutside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins.\nHome to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.\nFor Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.\nRunning the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.\nBurnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.\nStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.\nA once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.\nAs a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\nHealth has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.\nBut experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.\nAustralians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.\nHealthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.\nSeeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.\nThough she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.\n\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"\nWhen Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".\nHealth funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.\nPatients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.\nMedicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.\nFast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.\nThere is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.\nBut the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.\nThat is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.\nAccording to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.\nBut experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.\nBrisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.\n\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"\nAnd every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.\n\"[I] just can't keep up.\"\nThis is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. \nSo his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?\nThis year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.\nThe results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"\nAnd that's just primary care.\nPublic specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.\nThere are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.\nThe BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.\nOthers are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.\nKimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.\n\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.\n\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"\nAnother woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.\n\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.\nThe people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.\n\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.\nAll of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.\nEvery single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.\nStreaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.\nIt's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.\n\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.\n\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"\nShe came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.\nIt's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.\n\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.\nWhen the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.\nIt means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.\n\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.\nLike many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.\nThere's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.\nMany doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.\nHealth economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.\nThe taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.\n\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"\nThe original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.\nShe says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. \nBoth the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.\n\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.\nOn the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.\nHis government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.\nBut the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. \nProposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.\nOne Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.\nLabor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".\nBut many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. \nThere's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.\nExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.\nThat is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.\nAnd the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.\n\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.\nIn Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.\n\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.\n\"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\"",

We spoke to some of South Yorkshire's favourite creators about how the website changed their lives.\nRuth Amos from Sheffield runs Kids Invent Stuff. The channel has 71,000 followers and has been going since 2015. \nPrimary school children send in their invention ideas and Ruth and her colleague Shawn bring them to life.\n\"There's lots of different ways that you can make money from YouTube, there's ads, sponsors, collaborators or you can have things like Patreon, where people support the work that you're doing. \n\"Quite often, it you're a content creator you do a lot of those different ways, not just one of those things,\" she says.\n\"When I was growing up you couldn't watch someone's channel about robot making or cookery and that's what's amazing about YouTube \u2013 all of our hobbies have found a home on there as well as some of those viral moments.\"\nThe channel has run collaborations with Channel 4 TV show Taskmaster and had a go at breaking Guinness World Records. \nAccording to Ofcom, more than 80% of three to 17-year-olds use the site. A survey by the Lego Group in 2019 suggested a third of young Britons and Americans wanted to be vloggers. \nHowever, there are more than 100 million channels on the site - some with only a handful of followers or video watches.\nWould Ruth recommend the career to the children who send her their invention ideas? \n\"I think it is a career anyone can do because if you're interested in creating content, and you're creative, it's actually something lots of people can have a go at,\" she says. \n\"If someone wants to be a YouTuber I would also think about your other skills, because some of the most popular channels are channels where people are filming themselves doing something else. So think about your skill.\"\nLee Hinchcliffe, from Barnsley, has been filming content for the platform since he was 15. \nHe began with gaming videos before trying skit videos and then challenge videos.\nHis channel took off when he started playing McDonald's Monopoly. He spent hundreds of pounds at the chain trying to win a \u00a310,000 prize ticket. \n\"I never won it, I lost a lot of money, but people saw that video,\" he says.\n\"I've always had the love of creating videos and entertaining all my life, so that's why I've gone at it since school.\n\"YouTube is my university and I got my degree there, because you can watch back everything I've done.\" \nOff the back of his channel, Lee became a TV presenter with CBBC, starring on screen alongside madcap puppet Hacker T Dog. \nHe said his YouTube experience had made the switch to television much easier. \n\"Instead of doing a screen test and auditions, it was like, 'we've seen your videos, here's your mic, here's your earpiece, off you pop',\" he says.\n\"It's an obsession and it's grown into a career I'm able to do every day. There's no switch off because it's hard to switch off from something you love so much, and it needs constant plate spinning.\"\nSteve Garbutt, 55, runs Yorkshire Car Restoration in Doncaster with his son Shane.\nThe pair have been creating YouTube videos for the past five years and their business has boomed.\nSteve says they had gone from a 1,000ft warehouse to 10,000ft - and from three or four cars to more than 40.\n\"You have to put many hours into YouTube, because you not only have to do the work, you've got to change camera and lighting, and you're doubling your work load. Then you've got to go home and edit all your footage,\" he says.\n\"I've always been a bit of a techy, I like my gadgets and things. My original training when I left school was in computers. And then at 21 I changed careers because I thought there was too many people doing it.\"\nThey began on the platform by offering free car restoration to famous YouTubers such as Mat Armstrong, who has 4.5m followers.\n\"You've got to be very clever, you've got to look where the opportunities are. Rather than money it gives you a lot of opportunities. \n\"Our first opportunities were to restore famous YouTubers' cars free of charge, in exchange we got them advertising for us and sending us people to watch.\"\nThey have also worked with The Stig from Top Gear, Mike Brewer from Wheeler Dealers and Jonny Smith from The Late Brake Show.\nOriginally they hoped the channel would make money but they soon found the support they received more rewarding.\n\"We get so many good comments it makes you want to make another video. Even if the financial reward isn't there, because unless you're someone like Mat Armstrong it's not as profitable as everybody thinks,\" Steve says.\n\"The amount of hours you put in doesn't warrant that kind of money, you should be paid more. But the reward is massive.\n\"I would encourage someone not to just do YouTube, to make sure they get a career and base their YouTube on something they love.\n\"Don't think your niche is going to explode and make you famous.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North",

Right now, our business has brought losses, and we only have a little money left,\" said Jestina Chanya, a trader in Karongo, about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Tanzania. \nDiplomatic efforts to address the dispute have failed but Tanzania's agriculture minister said fresh talks were ongoing.\nLast month, Malawi blocked imports of flour, rice, ginger, bananas and maize from Tanzania, and other countries, saying this was to protect local producers. \nSouth Africa has for years prohibited the entry of bananas from Tanzania.\nOn Thursday, Tanzania's Agriculture Minister Hussein Bashe said trade restrictions from those two countries \"directly affected\" traders from his country and described the trade barrier as \"unfair and harmful\".\nBashe announced an immediate ban on all agricultural imports from the two countries, \"to protect our business interests\". \nTrade flows have been greatly affected at Kasumulu \u2013 the official border crossing between Tanzania and Malawi.\nWhen the BBC visited the Malawian town of Karonga, traders - mostly women - said they were still shaken by the sight of tonnes of their produce slowly rotting, then ultimately being dumped after being denied entry into Tanzania.\n\"The losses I have incurred are big because I can't go buy anything any more, and I don't even know how I will feed my children,\" said June Mwamwaja. \nBut Tanzanian traders have also been hit.\nOn Saturday Tanzania's agriculture minister posted a video on social media showing a pile of rotten bananas in a truck which had been prevented from entering Malawi.\nTonnes of tomatoes also spoiled at the border recently after lorries from Tanzania were denied entry into Malawi.\nMalawian traders like Jeniffa Mshani said they preferred agricultural goods from Tanzania because it was easier and more affordable to source them across the border. \n\"Tanzanian products are big and sell very well in the market, and their prices are good. Our local [Malawi] products are more expensive. I have nothing to do - I don't have the capacity to compete with those [who have big capital]. I just can't,\" she told the BBC. \nThey said Tanzanian produce, especially potatoes, were larger and of better quality. \nOthers said their customers preferred Tanzanian plantains over Malawian ones, describing the former as tastier, while the latter were often spongy.\nBut since Thursday, Malawian authorities, both at the border and in nearby markets, have become increasingly strict \u2013 often arresting traders found with Tanzanian produce. \n\"When we bring goods from Tanzania, they turn us back. One of us was stopped and arrested right at the border,\" another trader said. \nSome of them said they had no idea why they were being blocked while some rich business people were still allowed to transport goods across the border. \n\"They are targeting us who have little capital, while those with big money are still bringing in goods,\" said Ms Chanya, who sells potatoes and bananas in Karonga market. \nFollowing the crackdown, some traders have resorted to selling their goods in secret, afraid to display them openly for fear of arrest.\n\"We only carry three or four bunches [of bananas], just to earn a living for the children,\" said Evelina Mwakijungu, adding: \"But our large consignments have been blocked, so we have no business - we're struggling with our families\".\nThe normally bustling border crossing of Kasumulu remained noticeably quieter than usual with  drivers seen relaxing in the shade of trees, while others played draughts or lounged in the back of their lorries. \nThey declined to be quoted directly but explained that they were simply waiting for word from their bosses on what to do next.\nOn a normal day, more than 15 lorries loaded with agricultural produce would cross the border, drivers told the BBC.\nMalawi's trade ministry spokesperson Patrick Botha told local media that they were yet to get official communication on the issue.\n\"We are hearing [about] this from social media. At an appropriate time, we will comment,\" he was quoted as saying. \nMalawi has become an increasingly important market for Tanzanian goods in recent years, with exports trebling between 2018 and 2023, according to official Tanzanian figures.\nBut landlocked Malawi, which has relied on Tanzanian ports to carry its exports such as tobacco, sugar and soybeans to the rest of the world, will have to reroute its goods.\nIt is not yet clear how hard South Africa, which exports various fruits, including apples and grapes, to Tanzania, will be hit by the ban. South African authorities are yet to comment. \nThe row comes at a time when Africa is supposed to be moving towards greater free trade through the establishment of a continent-wide free-trade area, which began operating four years ago.\nAdditional reporting by Wycliffe Muia \nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Turning lawns into meadows can have big benefits for people, wildlife and the climate. Here's why 'meadowscaping' has become the latest gardening craze.\nWhen Sara Weaner Cooper and her husband bought their first home in Pennsylvania, they knew they didn't want a perfectly manicured front lawn like their neighbours. They wanted something that was more than just turf \u2013 a flourishing, wild meadow home to diverse species of plants and animals.\nIt was a bold plan, to be sure, considering it involved overhauling their entire lawn when they were new to the neighbourhood. Thankfully, Weaner Cooper had ideal support for the project \u2013 her father is Larry Weaner, a renowned ecological landscape designer (she is now chief executive of the firm he founded). The landscape design style he uses relies predominantly on native plants, she says, aiming to work with how they want to grow rather than forcing them into particular areas.\nShe grew up with a non-traditional garden curated by her father, which she remembers as a \"woodland wonderland\" because it was designed to support large trees. Today, it's still heavily wooded and teems with other native plants that prefer a shadier plot (his property gets less light than the Coopers'). Her father didn't plot it out or plant very much, she says, but did \"intentionally engage with it\", encouraging what it seemed to want to do.\nWeaner Cooper had always wanted to focus on native plants in her lawn and do less mowing, so rewilding their front lawn felt like the right move. But the Coopers' lawn is a different animal than her father's. It's in full Sun and consisted of over 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) of turfgrass \u2013 narrow-leaved grasses designed to look uniform that had to be dealt with before a meadow could fully take over. Rather than rip everything up and live with a drab, brown lawn for months, they decided to try strategically seeding and planting native plants into the existing turf, hoping it would eventually weed the turf out naturally.\u00a0\n\"It's easier in the sense that you don't need to be beating back as many weeds,\" explains Weaner Cooper. \"[The native plants] came in so thickly that [they] outcompeted a lot of the weed pressure that would have been there if we would have just made it brown.\"\nIt took about two years, lots of planning, some careful weeding, and some trial and error, but eventually a medley of waist-high native plant species blanketed their vast front lawn.\n\"Meadowscaping\", or turning a traditional lawn into a meadow, is a burgeoning trend experts in the field are noticing, especially among younger generations who tend to be more climate-aware than their predecessors. Compared to lawns, meadows \u2013 open landscapes filled with an array of non-woody plants such as tall grasses, flowers and herbs \u2013 are less expensive to maintain, require less water and energy and help sequester more CO2. Most importantly, they also encourage biodiversity and they're typically more appealing to pollinators, which are keystone species on which ecosystems depend.\nClimate change and habitat degradation are leading to major losses of native species in ecosystems worldwide, which in turn can disrupt how those ecosystems function. Meanwhile, lawns cover about 23% of the US's urban land areas and 70 to 75% of open green space in cities worldwide. The more people who rewild their lawns, the more significant the environmental impacts that could be seen, from lower pollution and stormwater runoff to a reduction in soil erosion and urban heat island effects, all while improving local biodiversity and soil and groundwater quality.\nBut meadowscaping isn't as simple as only locking your mower away (sorry, NoMoMay). There are methods to meadowscaping, and they aren't always the most intuitive, especially for beginners. To help others get started, Weaner Cooper's landscape design firm developed an online course taught by her father that walks interested parties through the steps, from interweaving aesthetics and ecology to addressing practical garden issues.\nOne of the most common questions from participants in the course, Weaner Cooper says, is, \"How should I handle my neighbours who might not appreciate how my meadow looks while it's in progress?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nShe used a clever solution for her own property: a sign in her garden that reads \"native meadow in progress\". \"I put my email, and I was just, like, 'ask me questions,'\" she says. No one reached out directly, but cars sometimes stopped to take pictures.\u00a0\nIn fact, Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states actively encouraging homeowners to transition their lawns to meadows. In 2020, the\u00a0Pennsylvania Department of Natural Resources\u00a0started a lawn conversion programme that in some cases helps finance meadow projects.\u00a0\n\"They cannot keep up with the demand,\" says Shishir Paudel, a plant ecologist at the Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \"It started in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, and it [was] so successful that they expanded into western Pennsylvania last year.\"\nPaudel and his colleague Sarah States, director of research and science education at the Phipps Conservatory, spent the last six years studying the differences in environmental impacts between traditional and meadowed lawns. He hopes the metrics they collected will help convince more people to convert their lawns. But it's the financial disparity that he thinks may turn the most heads: as well as being cheaper to set up than a conventional lawn, a seeded meadow is far more affordable to maintain.\u00a0\n\"You are likely to spend more than seven times more to manage one hectare of traditional lawn compared to meadow,\" says Paudel.\u00a0\nMaintaining a meadow also typically involves less work than regularly mowing a traditional lawn, but it's not completely hands off.\u00a0\"Every couple of weeks in the peak season I go out and trim things back, or mow the paths through the meadow,\" says Weaner Cooper. \"And it looks very intentional.\"\nStill, meadowscaping doesn't have to look as wild as the Coopers' lawn. Take Marc Johnson's meadow in Toronto, Canada. A professor of biology at the University of Toronto, Mississauga, his research on how urban landscapes impact plant-pollinator interactions inspired him to create various pollinator gardens within his front yard (and label them accordingly).\u00a0\nInitially, his house had a \"pristine\" traditional lawn that the previous owner had maintained using lots of pesticides. Johnson did away with the pesticides and took a staged approach to his meadowscaping. Unlike the Coopers, he focused on creating specific smaller pollinator gardens within his yard. He also primed the lawn somewhat differently, clearing away much of the existing turf, putting down new soil, and then planting a large portion of native perennials, plants that come back year after year.\n\"And so, one garden at a time, we started to convert that space into pollinator gardens of different themes and flavours,\" says Johnson. \"We just gradually took up the entire lawn.\"\nPollinator populations worldwide have declined precipitously over the last few decades. Monarch butterflies have been particularly impacted, and in just the last 20 years, the US has lost one-fifth of all its butterfly populations. But within the first year of his lawn conversion, Johnson says he began to see pollinators arriving to his flowering plants.\n\"You start to see pollinators that you have never seen in your yard before, and you didn't even know were in the area,\" he says. \"One of the favourites for the bees and the butterflies would be purple coneflower. It is a very hardy, easy-to-grow perennial that's very common in gardens. I'd say it's one of the best species for people to start with.\"\nStarting your own meadow\nThere are several ways to meadowscape a lawn, and what works on one property might not on another.\u00a0\nStill, experts agree you should aim for mostly native plant species (above 70% is often cited), with the ideal plants varying based on location. Johnson suggests finding a reputable nursery and asking them which are easy to grow and likely to come back.\nHe also recommends starting small. \"Even creating a diverse little garden on an apartment balcony can have an impact,\" he says.\u00a0\nIf you're looking for a quicker turnaround, you can remove the lawn with natural lawn and weed killer, such as white vinegar, or pull it up and start from scratch, says Weaner Cooper. It's more intensive, and you'll have a brown lawn for a time, but it'll give your new native species more room and fresher soil to grow.\nAs the various gardens on his lawn grew taller, Johnson's neighbours began asking questions, mainly about how they could do the same on their properties, he says \u2013 and none complained about his lack of lawn. After about two years, the whole yard transformed into a patchwork quilt of gardens. One section is entirely dedicated to evening primroses, a plant of particular biological interest to Johnson.\nJohnson describes his lawn as his own version of a national park. It's frequented by hummingbirds, endangered monarchs, and various species of bees, he says, which he even built a bee hotel for \u2013 although it's not intended to house honeybees, he says, which are not a native species in North America.\u00a0\n\"[The holes in the wood] are for the more diverse and ecologically important solitary bees, most of which are native,\" Johnson explains. \"There are many different species that are nesting in there right now. And they are coexisting, although they are competing. It's not necessarily a happy time, but there is a lot of diversity in that one location.\"\nJohnson's yard certainly involves some upkeep, especially as he tries to maintain the themes of his specific gardens, but he also recognises its need to evolve. \"Every year is different because the species are competing. If something gets really abundant, sometimes a pathogen will come in and wipe it out, and then other things start to come in.\"\nThis natural cycling of species is part of what makes meadows more resilient. Plant and animal species may compete from time to time, but that's an element of a healthy ecosystem that encourages natural selection and adaptation.\nA recent study at King's College at the University of Cambridge in the UK, which measured the effects of rewilding half of the college's 300-year-old lawn, saw similar ecological benefits to meadowscaping. It found the meadow side was more climate resilient than the traditional side of the lawn, reflecting away 25% more sunlight, which helps protect the inhabitants from heat damage.\nPlants typically found in meadows also tend to be more deep-rooted and, thus, more drought-tolerant. This makes them ideal for drier areas or those with limits to water consumption. What's more, their roots can help prevent stormwater runoff and even improve groundwater quality.\n\"In those diverse systems with the deep roots, [water] makes its way down into the bottom of the soil and then into the groundwater system,\" says Paudel. \"At the same time, it's filtered through [the vegetation] when it goes into the groundwater, so the water becomes fresher, less polluted.\"\nXeriscaping, or meadowscaping with predominantly drought-tolerant plants, has been a water-saving practice in the American West for over 80 years. Government agencies that help landowners implement the practice have seen strong results: 18,000 properties in Southern Nevada, for example, saw an overall 30% reduction in annual water use and a 54% reduction in water costs after converting their turf landscapes to xeriscapes.\nSimilar plants can mitigate stormwater runoff, so Johnson planted some in a ditch on his property that was prone to flooding, creating a bioswale \u2013 a shallow trench designed to slow runoff with plants that help absorb the water into the ground. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear: How allergies are affecting animals\n\u2022  Resurrection plants: The drought-resistant 'zombie plants' that come back from the dead\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\"We put in plants that are especially adapted to wetlands but can also survive dry periods,\" he says.\nThe plants help stormwater runoff by rapidly sucking up water, both storing it in their leaves and using it for evapotranspiration, whereby plants release water to the atmosphere through the stomata in their leaves as they bring in CO2 for photosynthesis. \"When I put water at one end of the ditch, by the time it got to the right-hand side of that, most of the water is gone,\" says Johnson.\nLarge-scale bioswales are even being implemented in cities like New York City to reduce flooding from sewer overflows and stormwater, which can pollute nearby bodies of water.\nDoing the heavy lifting (lawn turnover and initial planting) of meadowscaping is easier during the winter months, when most lawns are dormant anyway \u2013 a process called winter sowing. Melanie Rekola, a horticulturist and professional landscape designer in Canada, did just this.\u00a0\n\"We scraped away all the sod with machinery, and then we put down a little bit of soil, and I got a 100% native wildflower mix and we spread it,\" she says. \"You spread it in the fall after a couple of frosts. Then all winter, those seeds get their cold stratification [exposure to cold, damp air that helps it germinate when it gets warm again] and the moisture they need, and then they come up in springtime, like they've always been there.\"\u00a0\nAs the Coopers demonstrated, however, you don't need to remove everything from your lawn to plant a meadow. Paudel suggests a process called solarisation, where you cover your lawn with clear plastic in the summer, which traps heat and kills the turf. \"In one week, grass will die, and then you plant, deliberately,\" he says.\nStill, meadowscaping does have its limitations, one of the biggest being invasive species, which can overtake the native plants in a meadow if you don't keep an eye out for them. \"Keeping up with the weeding does take a little bit of time, like they don't know where the border of [a] garden is,\" says Johnson.\nMeadowed lawns have been shown to have notable health benefits and may even reduce the amount of air and sound pollution that enters your home. Paudel says even roadside vegetation acts as a physical barrier and filter: \"Vegetation holds air particles. If you live roadside and have tall plants, less air pollution will enter your house.\" Surrounding yourself with nature is also linked to reduced pain, improved cognitive function and restored attention and executive functioning in children and adolescents.\n\"It's a mental health booster. You look out your window in the spring, summer, fall, and almost every day, it's changing and it's beautiful,\" says Weaner Cooper.\u00a0\nAnd while it takes a fair amount of intentional curating, those who've rewilded their lawns seem to feel something beyond pride; rather more of a reverent stewardship of their local ecosystem.\n\"Imagine if half of an urban population took that view,\" says Johnson. \"We could dramatically change our ecosystems for the better, making cities much healthier environments.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

The decision by a Spanish scientific panel to block it came as a pleasant surprise to many of them.\n\"I was shocked,\" Lori told BBC News. \"We thought it was a fait accompli. We assumed that was where the orcas were going, it looked like a done deal.\"\nThe scientific panel's approval was needed to complete the transfer but they concluded Loro Parque's facilities did \"not meet the minimum requirements in terms of surface area, volume and depth necessary to house the specimens in optimal conditions\".\nDr Jan Schmidt-Burbach, head of animal welfare and wildlife research at the charity World Animal Protection, said the decision was \"unexpected but rational\".\nHe added that it \"perfectly illustrates the fact that marine parks are an outdated industry with dropping acceptability\" in society.\nLoro Parque responded to the panel's decision by saying their \"facilities are recognised by independent assessors as providing among the highest levels of animal welfare in the world\".\nThe WSP has identified a site in Port Hilford Bay, Nova Scotia that they plan to cordon off using 1,600m of nets.\nThe project's team also contains people who were involved in a whale sanctuary that was created to house Keiko \u2013 the orca who starred in the 1993 movie Free Willy.\nCharles Vinick, CEO of the WSP, managed the Keiko project in Iceland and Jeff Foster, who specialises in moving marine animals, was also part of that team.\nKeiko was born in the wild and was able to relearn some survival skills after arriving at the sanctuary in 1998.\nHe spent four years there before leaving with a pod of orcas he had joined.

This will require extraordinary efforts both from us and European partners,\" he added.\nAs talks ramp up, Russian strikes on Ukraine have continued. \nOn Thursday, an attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured dozens, officials said. The BBC witnessed the body of a child being brought out from the wreckage of their home while people quietly cried nearby.\nSvitlana, a teacher at a school close by which was also hit, spoke of her hurt and added she believed Russia would not stop its aggression if Ukraine gave up Crimea.\n\"Those who think that Putin will stop if he is given Crimea, they don't know who the Russians are, he is not going to stop,\" she said. \nShe said Zelensky expresses the opinion of \"all of us and we support him\".\nAnother woman, Olha, who had helped rescue workers carry out 10 people, five of whom were dead and the rest injured, was more critical.\n\"As of now I think it's better to be away from here because nothing good awaits us here,\" she said, adding there \"will not be a good solution\" for Ukraine. \nShe said Zelensky \"was a comedian and he should have stayed a comedian\".",

        "article_text": "In Armenia tech education starts early.\nIn a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights.\n\"He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

        "article_text": "Top executives at well-known US firms are warning about the impact that tariffs are having on their companies and the wider economy.\nTechnology giant Intel, footwear maker Skechers and consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble, have either cut their profit forecasts or withdrawn them citing economic uncertainty.\nUS President Donald Trump has been trying to rebalance relations with key trading partners by using steep tariffs to bring them to the negotiating table.\nNo new trade agreements between the US and other countries have been announced yet but there have been signs of progress in talks with South Korea.\n\"The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing,\" said Intel's chief financial officer, David Zinsner, during a call with investors.  \n\"We will certainly see costs increase,\" he added as the California-based firm announced gloomy profit and revenue forecasts.\nIntel's shares dropped by more than 5% in extended trading after those remarks.\nBeyond the technology industry, footwear maker Skechers also disappointed investors. The firm's shares fell after it withdrew its annual results forecast. \n\"The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,\" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call.\nSkechers - like rivals Nike, Adidas and Puma - uses factories in Asia, particularly in China, to make its products.\nComments from Procter & Gamble (P&G) executives also hinted at how tariffs could mean higher prices for its customers.\nThe maker of Ariel, Head & Shoulders and Gillette said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places. It also said it expected sales to grow this year less than previously forecast.\n\"We'll be looking for every opportunity to mitigate the impact,\" said Andre Schulten, P&G's financial chief, adding that there will be adjustments to \"some level of consumer pricing\".\nThe Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven convenience stores, Seven & I, said it is also feeling the impact of the trade tensions.\nNorth America account for more than 70% of its sales. \nIts incoming chief executive, Stephen Dacus, told the BBC about the uncertainty faced by the business.\n\"We don't know what those tariffs are going to be.

Filipinos form one of the largest immigrant groups in the province. \nSo far, very little is known about the identity of those were were killed and wounded in the attack. \nIn a brief news conference on Saturday, acting Vancouver police chief Steve Rai said that men, women and young people were among the victims. \nTheir ages range from five to 65, he added.\nThe attack has deeply affected Vancouver's tight-knit Filipino community. \nRJ Aquino, the head of the Filipino BC organisation, said that \"last night was extremely difficult and the community will feel this for a long time.\"\n\"We know that there's a lot of questions floating about and we don't have all the answers, but we want to tell everybody that we're grieving,\" he added.\nPolice have not yet named the suspect, who they identified only as a 30-year-old resident of the Vancouver area. \nWhile investigators have not confirmed a motive, Rai said that police are confident \"that the evidence in this case does not lead us to believe this was an act of terrorism.\" \nThe suspect, he added, has \"a significant history of interactions with police and healthcare professionals related to mental health\".\nVancouver's mayor, Ken Sim, similarly said that \"mental health appears to be the underlying issue here.\" \nNo further details have been provided on the previous interactions for police, what they entailed or when they took place. \nRai said only that there had not been any interaction with officers in the \"immediate\" lead-up to the attack ",

Trump has previously blamed Ukraine for starting the war and has accused Zelensky multiple times of being an obstacle to peace negotiations. \nBut the White House struck a more positive tone about Saturday's meeting, while Zelensky described the sit down as a \"very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results\".\nTwo images were released of the meeting, showing the US leader in a blue suit and Ukrainian president in a black top and trousers, sitting opposite each other in intense conversation.\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also posted an image of the meeting on X with the caption: \"No words are needed to describe the importance of this historic meeting. Two leaders working for peace in St. Peter's Basilica.\"\nAnother image posted by the Ukrainian delegation from inside St Peter's showed the two men standing alongside British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron, his hand on Zelensky's shoulder. \nThe implication was that the prime minister and French president had helped to bring the two together, against the sombre backdrop of the funeral.\nAfter the meeting, Trump and Zelensky walked down the steps of the basilica, where Zelensky's arrival was met with applause from the crowds, and took their seats in the front row. \nDuring the service, the pair sat a short distance from each other, with Macron and other heads of state in between.\nIn his homily, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re spoke of Pope Francis's incessant calls for peace. \"'Build bridges, not walls' was an exhortation he repeated many times,\" said the cardinal.\nUkrainian officials had talked of a possible second meeting but Trump's motorcade drove away from St Peter's immediately afterwards and his plane left Rome a short time later.\nZelensky however later met Macron in the garden of Villa Bonaparte, home to the French embassy to the Holy See, and Sir Keir at Zelensky and Starmer together too at Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence. He also met EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\nIn a post on X, Macron said ending the war in Ukraine was an objective that \"we share in common with President Trump\", adding that Ukraine was ready for \"an unconditional ceasefire\".\nA Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer and Zelensky discussed the positive progress that had been made recently to \"secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\" adding that the pair had agreed to \"maintain momentum\" and \"speak again at the earliest opportunity\".\nDuring February's heated White House exchange, Trump accused the Ukrainian president of \"gambling with World War Three\" by not going along with ceasefire plans led by Washington.\nKyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war.\nThese concessions would reportedly include giving up large portions of land, including the Crimean peninsula which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.\nZelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea in the past. He suggested to the BBC on Friday that \"a full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything\".",

The King, when he was Prince of Wales, attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005 on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II.\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla were among the last high-profile figures meet the Pope at his residence Casa Santa Marta during a royal visit to Italy earlier this month.\nThe King paid tribute to Pope Francis's \"compassion\" and said \"through his care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many\".\nHe said he and the Queen remembered \"with particular affection\" their meetings with the Pope over the years, and \"were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month\".\nLula, who shared a personal rapport with the Pope, and first lady Janja Lula da Silva, will attend the funeral.\nBrazil is home to the world's largest Catholic population, with over 100 million Catholics. Following news of Pope Francis's death on Monday, Lula declared seven days of mourning.\n\"Humanity loses today a voice of respect and welcome for others,\" Lula said.\nNoting the meetings he had held with the Pope over the years, Lula said: \"We were able to share our ideals of peace, equality, and justice - ideals that the world has always needed, and will always need.\"\nTrump announced on his Truth Social platform that he and first lady Melania would attend the Pope's funeral, marking the first foreign trip of his second term as US president.\nAfter news of the Pope's death emerged, Trump ordered that all federal and state flags be flown at half-mast in honour of the late pontiff. He called Pope Francis \"a very good man\" who \"loved the world\" and \"he especially loved people that were having a hard time\".\nThe pair clashed in the past. In 2016, Pope Francis criticised Trump's proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, saying a person \"who thinks only about building walls\" and \"not building bridges, is not Christian\".\nTrump hit back, saying: \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.\"\nAfter Trump met the Pope during a trip to the Vatican in 2017, he said: \"He is something, he's really good. We had a fantastic meeting.\"\nIn February, Pope Francis described Trump's mass deportations as a \"major crisis\".\nMarcos Jr, who will be in attendance on Saturday, described Francis as the \"best Pope in my lifetime\".\n\"A man of profound faith and humility, Pope Francis led not only with wisdom but with a heart open to all, especially the poor and the forgotten,\" he said.\nThe Philippines is one of the world's most Catholic countries, with almost 80% of Filipinos identifying as Roman Catholic.\nPope Francis's last visit to the country in 2015 drew a crowd of six million people at an outdoor Mass in the capital city Manila, a record for a papal event.\nIn the running to become the next Pope is Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, a Cardinal from the Philippines. Cardinal Tagle has been called the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants.\nThe Ukrainian president had said he would travel to Vatican City with first lady Olena Zelenska for the funeral.\nBut on Friday, he said he may not be able to attend due to a number of military meetings, following a strike on Kyiv on Thursday.\nHe said the first lady and foreign minister would still attend.\nIn an earlier tribute to Pope Francis, Zelensky said: \"He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity.\"\n\"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians.\"\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Francis made repeated calls for peace and an end to the war. The two leaders met several times at the Vatican, most recently last October.\nFollowing that meeting, Pope Francis wrote on X: \"All nations have the right to exist in peace and security. Their territories must not be attacked, and their sovereignty must be respected and guaranteed through peace and dialogue.\"\nEarlier in 2024, Ukraine had strongly rejected a call by the pontiff for Kyiv to negotiate an end to the war and have \"the courage to raise the white flag\".\nOther political figures and royals who will attend the Pope's funeral include:",

        "article_text": "A man has been charged with eight counts of second degree murder after a car drove into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver, Canada, killing at least 11 people - including a five-year-old girl.\nKai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, appeared in court late on Sunday and was returned to custody, Vancouver Police Department said, adding that further charges are expected.\nActing police chief Steve Rai described Saturday's attack at the Lapu Lapu Day festival - which was attended by up to 100,000 people - as the \"darkest day in the city's history\".\nThe identities of those killed have not yet been released by officials, and police said dozens more were hurt in the attack which is not being treated as terrorism.\nPolice said the suspect was known to them prior to the attack.\nOrganisers of the annual Lapu Lapu festival said the city's tight-knit Filipino community was \"grieving\" and the attack's impact will be felt for years to come. \nThe attack took place at around 20:14 local time on Saturday (03:14 GMT) at East 43rd Avenue and Fraser in the south of Vancouver.\nSeveral eyewitnesses to Saturday's attack described the moment the black SUV vehicle ploughed into crowds.\n\"There's a car that went just through the whole street and just hitting everyone,\" Abigail Andiso, a local resident, told the Associated Press.\n\"I saw one dead, one man on the ground, and I went... towards the end where the car went, then there are more casualties, and you can see straight away there are about... maybe 20 people down, and everyone is panicking, everyone is screaming.\"\nMr Lo was taken into custody by police officers after being detained by bystanders at the scene, police added. \nAt a separate news briefing on Sunday, Mr Rai said: \"The number of dead could rise in the coming days or weeks.\" \nWhile Mr Rai declined to specify any potential motive, he said that he \"can now say with confidence that the evidence in this case does not lead us to believe this was an act of terrorism\".\nThe suspect, he added, has \"a significant history of interactions with police and healthcare professionals related to mental health\". \nThe annual festival in Vancouver - home to over 140,000 Canadians of Filipino descent - commemorates Lapu-Lapu, a national hero who resisted Spanish colonisation in the 1500s. \nAccording to Mr Rai, police had conducted a threat assessment ahead of the festival, and had partially closed a road on a street behind a school where the bulk of the festivities were taking place. \nThere was nothing to indicate a higher threat level for the event, he added.\nThe street where the attack took place was largely being used by food trucks and there were no barriers in place.\nRai said that the incident would be a \"watershed moment\" for city officials and first responders. \nSpeaking at a news conference the following day, RJ Aquino, the head of the Filipino BC organisation, said Saturday night \"was extremely difficult and the community will feel this for a long time\".\n\"We know that there's a lot of questions floating about and we don't have all the answers, but we want to tell everybody that we're grieving,\" he added. \nMr Aquino said the attack caused considerable confusion and chaos in the city's tight-knit Filipino community. Many residents had called one another to check on their loved ones.\n\"I don't think my phone has buzzed that much in my entire life,\" he said. \"There was a lot of panic and, you know, relief, when somebody answers.\" \nAt the scene on Sunday, people laid flowers and paid their respects.\nOne woman, named Donna, was at the festival and said it was packed with young people and families.\n\"People were here to celebrate and have fun,\" she told the BBC. \"This is tragic.\"\nThe attack came just before Canada's federal election on 28 April. It prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to cancel large gatherings of Liberal Party supporters in Calgary and Richmond. \nIn a televised address to Canadians, Mr Carney said he was \"heartbroken\" and \"devastated\" by the attack. \nHe visited the scene of the attack on Sunday evening, where he lit a candle and stood in silence with dozens of members of the local community.\nMr Carney also met family members of the victims and laid flowers during a church service vigil.\nThe main opposition candidate, Pierre Poilievre, continued campaigning, but made an unscheduled stop at a church in Mississauga - a suburb of Toronto - to meet with members of the Filipino community.\nAppearing alongside his wife Anaida Poilievre, the Conservative leader expressed his condolences. \"I wanted to be here with you in solidarity,\" he told the church attendees.\nMeanwhile, the leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party David Eby, said he was \"shocked and heartbroken\". \nOne Canadian political leader, the New Democrats' Jagmeet Singh, was among those who attended the Lapu Lapu festival on Saturday, and subsequently changed his planned events on Sunday. \nHe said it was \"heart-breaking\" to see that \"such joy can be torn apart so violently.\n\"I saw families gathered together, I saw children dancing, I saw pride in culture, in history and community,\" he added.

        "article_text": "Days after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar at the end of March, killing at least 3,700 people, the country's ruling junta agreed to a halt in its devastating military campaign.\nIt then violated that ceasefire, again and again.\nI went inside rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state for 10 days from mid-April. I witnessed daily violations by the junta, including rocket and mortar attacks which killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters.\nOne of those was Khala, a 45-year-old father killed in a strike by military warplanes, in a place his wife Mala said should have been safe.\nWhen the ceasefire was announced, on 2 April, Mala and Khala sensed an opportunity to return to their home for the first time in years.\nWith their four-year-old child, they headed from the camp where they'd taken refuge to their village, Pekin Coco. They found it abandoned, with buildings shattered from drawn-out fighting. Almost everyone there had moved to farmland further away from the junta's weapons.\nBut as the young family was about to leave Pekin Coco again, their car loaded with their possessions, the shelling started.\n\"We were all at the front of the house. Then, shells landed near us. We hid at the back of the house. But he [Khala] stayed where he was,\" said Mala. \"The artillery shell landed and exploded near him. He died in the place where he thought he was safe.\n\"He was a good man,\" she said and began to cry.\nLater that afternoon, the junta's warplanes attacked a house on the same street, killing four more men.\n\"I hate them,\" Mala said. \"They always attack people without reason. I don't feel safe here. Jet fighters are flying over the sky often but there is no place to hide.\"\nMala is 31 and seven months pregnant. When we spoke she was back in a displaced people's camp, grieving. Her son Zoe, missing his father, wouldn't leave her side.\nBefore the earthquake, Myanmar was in the midst of a nationwide civil war.\nAfter decades of military rule and brutal repression, ethnic groups, along with a new army of young insurgents, brought the dictatorship to crisis point. As much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the resistance.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed, including many children, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The UN says the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, some 2.5 million were already displaced before the quake.\nKarenni, or Kayah, state is far from the earthquake's epicentre. Its remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Its thick jungle provides cover for those who oppose military rule, but it is difficult to get around, the roads are poor and main highways remain in range of the army's guns. Most of the state is now controlled by rebel and armed ethnic groups.\nOn 28 March when the quake hit, there were no reported deaths in Karenni - but the hospitals still filled quickly with people suffering spinal and crush injuries.\nA 30m (100ft) sinkhole had appeared in the forests around the town of Demoso. Locals who heard the ground open up thought it was another air strike. For many weeks, the sinkhole continued to expand with the aftershocks.\nThe UN noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end. The State Administration Council, the ruling junta, has not commented on the alleged violations but has claimed that it was attacked by resistance groups. During the ceasefire all sides in the conflict have reserved the right to respond if attacked.\nDuring my 10 days in Mobeye, Karenni, I witnessed daily attacks by the junta.\nI met Stefano there, a 23-year-old fighting the military dictatorship with the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF).\nHe leads a platoon of young fighters who have set up trenches around the base.\nFrom a dugout just 100m (330ft) from the junta's positions, he explained the army had continued attacks \"using all means\" during the ceasefire - soldiers on the ground, drones and jets.\n\"They usually attack with drones and heavy artillery on this side. When it rains, they advance by taking advantage of the weather.\"\nHe called the ceasefire a \"joke\". \n\"We did not believe the military council from the beginning. We don't believe it now, and we won't believe it in the future.\"\nThe day after we spoke, the military launched a full-scale assault with heavy weapons and men, attacking rebel lines. As we made our way to the front lines, small-arms fire could be heard nearby, along with mortar strikes. The ground was pitted with fresh hits from armed drones.\nNearby lay the corpse of a junta fighter who had tried to breach the rebel positions. The resistance forces say they have suspended all offensive activities during the ceasefire, but they have said they will respond if attacked. Yi Shui, the commander of another resistance group, the Karenni National Army, showed me pictures on his phone. \"When we saw them, we shot them. One of them got hit\" and another ran away, he said.\nAnd again, the military wasn't just targeting the resistance forces. Its rockets hit farmland beyond, killing a 60-year-old woman. We arrived at fields where four rockets had landed, children were playing with the bent metal and shrapnel from the strikes.\nThe injured were taken to local hospitals, which are hidden deep in the jungle to avoid air strikes from junta warplanes.\nIn one, a young fighter was being treated in a wooden ward with a dirt floor. He had a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and was losing a lot of blood.\nThe doctor in charge, 32-year-old Thi Ha Tun, said he'd treated around a dozen patients for war-related injuries since the ceasefire was declared. Two of the patients, resistance fighters, died.\nHe dismissed what he called the junta's lies. \"They only care about their own interests,\" he said. \"They will only care about their own organisation. They will not care about the rest of this country, their own generation, the youth, the children, the elderly, anything.\"\nThe only solution is to keep fighting, he said.\nHigh on a hilltop in the rebel-controlled areas is the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The earthquake brought down the church steeple and part of the roof. The bell from Rome now sits in a temporary cradle. Repairs have been made, but the church will probably need to be rebuilt.\nThey are still feeling the aftershocks here weeks later.\nBut for Father Philip, the local priest, the greatest threat to his congregation, many of whom are the war displaced, comes from above, not below.\n\"No place is safe. When we have jet fighters flying in the sky\u2026 you never know what will come falling from the sky.\"\nBack at the Mobeye front, Stefano and his men pass the hours between attacks, cleaning their weapons and singing songs. \"I can hear the people's prayers, cries, and cries. We will overthrow the dictatorship,\" they sing in unison. They say the only ceasefire they will trust will come with the junta's defeat. \nThe truce will finish at the end of the month, but for most of the people here, it's as if it never existed at all.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nFighting Benn is 10 times bigger now - Eubank\nParading in luxury designer finery, rubbing shoulders with A-list celebrities and playing poker with filthy-rich footballers \u2013 Chris Eubank Jr has never really marketed himself as a man of the people.\nBut, deep down, everybody wants to be liked, and the 35-year-old is no different.\n\"People say that 'he's been happy to play the bad guy'. I wasn't happy about it,\" Eubank says.\n\"I didn't like getting booed into arenas for all these years. I don't like waking up and going on my Instagram and seeing people saying 'you're going to get knocked out' and 'you're not as good as your old man'.\"\nThe Brighton boxer says he has learned to accept, even \"relish\", the villain tag. In the build-up to Saturday's fight with Conor Benn, however, the lines between the 'good' and 'bad' guys have blurred.\nEubank will face his fellow Briton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in boxing's latest grudge match \u2013 two and a half years after their cancelled bout because of Benn's failed drugs tests.\nBenn has since been cleared to fight and denies intentionally doping, but the scandal has tarnished his reputation. Consequently, it's morphed Eubank into British boxing's unlikely antihero.\n\"I don't know what to expect. This could be the first fight in history where both guys in a mega fight get booed into an arena,\" Eubank says.\n\"[But] however much of a bad guy I am, I didn't cheat. I walked the hard path being that bad guy.\"\nWhile his public image may be improving, Eubank's fractured relationship with his father, Chris Eubank Sr, has threatened to overshadow the fight.\n\"I've told him I want him there [on Saturday]. I've told him what it means to me, the public, to the fight fans,\" Eubank says. \"He doesn't seem to care or he doesn't seem to understand.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, an emotional Eubank opens up on their public fall-out and what happens if he loses to Benn on Saturday.\nEubank misses weight and fined \u00a3375,000\n'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain\nEubank v Benn to be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live\nThis video can not be played\n'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain\nAs each day passes in fight week, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that Eubank Sr will attend Saturday's fight. \nHe had been an ever-present at the start of his son's career, but their relationship has become strained.\n\"It got to a stage where I realised for the public to be able to see who I was as a man and as a fighter, I had to step away from that huge figure,\" Eubank says.\nBarry Hearn said Eubank Sr, who he promoted for a number of years, was a \"very strict disciplinarian as a father\".\n\"He said to me once 'Bazza, how do you let your boy talk to you like that?\" Hearn said.\n\"I said to him 'your son has to be your friend as well, Chris'. I don't think he ever bought into that.\"\nEubank acknowledges the public interest in his life and is open to discussing issues far more important than boxing. \nWhile he has forged a reputation of being a composed fighter, outside of the ring he has shown his emotions and vulnerability to the public, with his personal life tinged with tragedy over the past four years.\nIn 2021, his 29-year-old brother Sebastian died of a heart attack in Dubai. Eubank has become a father figure to his nephew, who was just a month old at the time.\nEubank Sr has labelled the Benn bout a \"circus\" because of the weight disparity; Benn is going up two divisions and Eubank is prohibited from rehydrating more than 10lb after the weigh-in.\n\"I think this fight once it's over, there's a possibility that things may be able to reconcile or there's a possibility it will make our relationship even harder to rebuild,\" Eubank Jr says.\n\"What I do know is once I am out of boxing, then it will definitely be easier for us to rebuild what's been lost.\"\nHow 'nepo kid' Benn has prepared for Eubank fight\n5 Live Boxing with Bunce: Eddie & Barry Hearn\nAs Eubank has stepped out of his father's shadow, more of him as a man and fighter has emerged.\nEubank is quite the maverick, a boxer who never pinned himself down to one promoter or trainer for a significant length of time.\nRecent outbursts have even landed him in legal bother and subsequent retractions.\n\"So many boxers and fighters get caught up in the treachery of the people that are in the industry,\" he says, describing the sport as \"shady\".\nWhile he may have burnt bridges with influential boxing people down to a crisp, Eubank is perfectly capable of single-handedly promoting a fight.\nJust like Chris Eubank Sr did with Nigel Benn during their rivalry in the 1990s, Jr \u2013 minus his father's monocle and jodhpurs - seems to know which buttons will inflame an opponent.\nHe says that targeting Benn's emotions is not a deliberate ploy, though.\n\"I've never thought I need to think of something that's really going to get to Conor. I don't care about Conor. I only care about me,\" Eubank says.\nReferencing the now-infamous incident when he slapped Benn across the face with an egg \u2013 which resulted in a \u00a3100,000 fine \u2013 Eubank feels he kept his composure.\n\"I had Nigel Benn's hand wrapped around my neck at one point, but if you see my face, it's like I'm walking down the street,\" he says.\n\"I'm not angry, I'm not scared, I'm not worried. I'm just looking at him. I'm not wasting energy on these guys.\"\nEubank said he wanted to humiliate Benn by slapping him with an egg at a news conference last month\nEubank has proven his quality with wins over former world champions Arthur Abraham, James DeGale and Liam Smith. He has a lot to be proud of.\nHe is fully aware, however, that a defeat to Benn could end up defining his 14-year career.\n\"There's so much at stake \u2013 respect, family, pride, money and my career. I said it, if I lose I retire. That is a horrible thing to say and to know but it's the truth,\" he says.\nEvaluating Eubank's boxing career depends on how you measure success.\nIn 37 fights, he is yet to capture a world title. He lost his only challenge for world honours to George Groves in 2018.\nIf he never becomes a world champion, is it a case of unfulfilled potential? Eubank has certainly shown he is capable enough.\nAs a commodity, though, Eubank remains one of British boxing's biggest draws. He has sold out arenas and earned seven-figure paydays.\nAnd he is not ready to give it all up just yet.\n\"I love being a fighter. I love training. I love competing. I love testing myself mentally and physically,\" he says.\n\"This is my life. On April 27th, I don't want to wake up and say it's done. I really don't.\"\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.\nTen of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.\nOnly Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.\nThe exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.\nCommentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.\nWhile plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.\nHere I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.\nSouth America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.\nThe US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.\nFor example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.\nThere is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.\nWith the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.\nThese include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.\nHe tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".\nHowever, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.\nSo his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.\n\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.\nYet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.\nTake the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.\nJapan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.\nOther Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.\nBrazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.\nTrump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.\nThis would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.\nMeanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place. \nThe other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.\nUruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.\nHe said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.\nYou may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.\nWhether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.\nFirstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.\nThe US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.\nBrazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.\nArgentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.\n\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.\nTrump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.\nEduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.\nLooking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.\nAfter all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.\nMr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"\nHe theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.\nSo, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.\nAs Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"\nSubject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.\nBut adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"\n",

Judge Garnett asked prosecutors to write a letter within seven days explaining how Mr Mangione would be ensured access to a separate phone line to make privileged calls with his legal team.\nThe judge also asked Ms Friedman Agnifilo to submit a new motion by 27 June requesting the government be prevented from seeking the death penalty, since she submitted her first motion before prosecutors formally filed notice that they would do so.\nJudge Garnett also asked prosecutors to remind Bondi and government officials of rules surrounding public statements and their impact on a fair trial and jury selection.\nMr Mangione is also facing state charges in both Pennsylvania, where he was arrested, and New York.

Five days later, Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's restaurant in Pennsylvania.\nPublic reaction to Mr Thompson's killing has shed light on deep frustrations with privatised healthcare. Some have celebrated Mr Mangione has a folk hero, and a fund set up for his legal defence garnered nearly $1m (\u00a3750,000) in donations.\nSupporters gathered outside the courthouse on Friday too. \nShell casings with the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were found at the crime scene. Critics say these words are associated with healthcare companies avoiding payouts and increasing their profits.",

        "article_text": "Arsenal are the only English team to have won the Women's Champions League - doing so in 2007 when the competition was known as the Uefa Women's Cup\nUefa Women's Champions League: Lyon v Arsenal\nVenue: Groupama Stadium Date: Sunday, 27 April Kick-off: 17:00 BST\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nArsenal are down, but they're definitely not out of their Women's Champions League semi-final against eight-time winners Lyon.\nThe Gunners had more shots, more possession and more touches inside their opponent's box in the first leg, but ultimately it was Lyon who left Emirates Stadium with a 2-1 lead.\nNow, Renee Slegers' side must overturn a deficit in France on Sunday if they are to reach their first Champions League final since 2007, the season in which they won the title.\nThey face a stiff task though, with Lyon unbeaten in the Champions League this season, having conceded just three goals in nine games. They have only been knocked out twice in 15 years after winning the first leg in the knockout stage and on those occasions it was to the now redundant away goals rule.\nWhile Chelsea's hopes of a first European trophy have been left hanging by a thread after their 4-1 first-leg defeat in Barcelona, there is belief Arsenal can still turn things around to ensure there is at least one English team in the final.\n\"This isn't 4-1. It's a completely different narrative, Arsenal are still in it. It's a completely different conversation,\" former Gunners defender Jen Beattie said.\nBut how exactly can Arsenal turn it around against a team that have reached the final of the Champions League 11 times in 15 years?\nBompastor set for 'biggest challenge' of career\nWomen\u2019s Champions League: Can Chelsea and Arsenal fight back?\nThis video can not be played\nWhy Arsenal must 'go for it' against Lyon\nIt wasn't so long ago that Arsenal put five goals past Lyon on French soil.\nPlaying under Jonas Eidevall - before Slegers had joined as his assistant manager - the Gunners outclassed the reigning champions in the group stage in 2022.\nCaitlin Foord, Frida Maanum and Beth Mead, who all started for Slegers on Saturday, were on the scoresheet.\nBut Arsenal lacked that ruthlessness against Lyon last Saturday, with Mead, Maanum, Foord and Alessia Russo missing multiple chances.\n\"Arsenal showed enough in this first leg to take confidence,\" ex-England defender Anita Asante told the Football News Show.\n\"They really dominated the ball, they had control in the final third, created a number of chances and they just missed some of that cutting edge.\"\nKadidiatou Diani beat Arsenal's offside trap to get behind their defence and she made no mistake with a crisp finish for a 17th-minute opener.\nAnd just as the hosts had pulled level through Mariona Caldentey's spot-kick, Lyon split their backline open with Ada Hegerberg pulling Leah Williamson out of position to open up space for Melchie Dumornay, who darted into the box and lifted the ball over Manuela Zinsberger.\n\"Lyon under Joe Montemurro are not afraid to not have the ball. They get the goals they need, sit back and don't seek to dominate necessarily,\" Asante added.\n\"They're a team that will play in transition and their players, especially in that front three, are all really dynamic and can play into space, carry the ball or threat in the box.\n\"I don't think it suits Arsenal necessarily to play on the counter. They will probably assess the first 10-15 minutes of the game and adapt from there.\"\nDespite their first-leg defeat, Beattie does not expect Arsenal to play \"very differently\".\n\"I think they got the press wrong once and Diani scored. I can't think of many other times where Lyon played through from a goal kick,\" she said.\n\"I think the Arsenal press was very, very good and if they do that again, they can go and get a result.\"\nSlegers said Arsenal must be wary of \"a lot of threats\", but that her side have the ability to \"expose\" Lyon.\n\"We're super humble for the task because they probably have the next level in them - but so do we,\" she said. \nKadidiatou Diani v Katie McCabe\nWith a front three made up of Diani, Dumornay and Tabitha Chawinga, Lyon are never going to be easy to contain.\nArsenal's full-back Katie McCabe, usually seen powering up and down the left flank, was more reserved when pitted against the rapid Diani in the first leg.\nThe winger found space by drifting infield between McCabe and Steph Catley and it was this movement that gifted Lyon the first goal, with Ellie Carpenter threading the ball through Arsenal's defence to put Diani one-on-one with Zinsberger.\nPost-match Lyon boss Montemurro said that was a key tactic they had identified to restrict McCabe's impact.\n\"Of course, I respect Diani and the whole Lyon team because of what they've achieved, but also we know our qualities and our strengths, especially going forward,\" McCabe said.\n\"And for me, that is one of my strengths, making forward runs and driving into spaces and delivering a ball into the box.\"\nMcCabe's pass map against Real Madrid (left) and Lyon (right)\nWendie Renard v Alessia Russo\nOne of the key questions for Slegers' side before the second leg is whether Wendie Renard will be back in the starting XI to make her 500th appearance for Lyon.\nThe 6ft 2in defender - known for her aerial prowess - was on the bench on Saturday after recovering from a foot injury.\n\"Crosses in the box were really effective [and] I think that's where Arsenal's best chances came from, but if Renard is back it is a different game, different tactics,\" Beattie said.\n\"[Arsenal will] have to play more passes in and around the box and break them down.\"\nArsenal scored all three of their goals from crosses during their second-leg comeback against Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, but they failed to make any of their 25 crosses count in the first leg against Lyon.\nRusso, the Gunners' top scorer with 18 goals this season, will want to more involved and put herself in dangerous areas after having just four touches inside Lyon's box.\nLindsey Heaps v Mariona Caldentey\nMariona Caldentey knows what it takes to win the Champions League.\nThe Spaniard won three European titles in four years with Barcelona before moving to Arsenal in July, and she's carried that winning mentality into this season.\nHaving scored in Arsenal's comeback against Real Madrid, Caldentey kept cool under the pressure to convert from the penalty spot against Lyon - her eighth goal involvement in this season's Champions League.\nBut it's not just her ability in attack that has helped Arsenal this term.

He had a chance to end only two frames behind, but another miss in frame eight helped O'Sullivan inch a step closer to the winning target in the best-of-25-frame match.\nO'Sullivan, Higgins and Williams all joined the professional tour in 1992, and 33 years later they remain formidable competitors on the biggest stages.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank. \nElevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.\nBut however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse. \nNot only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"\nComing at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.\nThe tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.\nIt came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.\nBut Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.\nDonald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy. \n\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"\nTrump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.\nLower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.\nTrump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.\nHe objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.\n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.\nTrump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.\nNor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.\nTrump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.\nIt has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.\nThe idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.\nSarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled. \nIf shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.\n\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.\nJoe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.\n\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy. \nHe said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed. \n\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"\nPowell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him. \nBut the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate. \nBy law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.\nThe administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure. \nMark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.\n\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.\nAsked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\"",

It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.Can Trump fire Powell?Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws. \"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "If one of a pair of twins is allergic to something, does that mean the other twin will be sensitive too?\nAllergies, whether spring sneezes due to pollen or trouble breathing triggered by a certain food, are caused by a combination of someone's genes and the environment they live in. The more of these things two people share, the higher their chances of being allergic to the same things. Twins are more likely to share allergies because of everything they have in common, but the story doesn't end there.\nAllergies are really complex and a lot of factors play a role in who gets them and who doesn't.\nYour immune system makes defence proteins, antibodies, whose job is to keep watch and attack any invading germs or other dangerous substances that get inside your body before they can make you sick.\nAn allergy happens when your body mistakes some usually harmless substance for a harmful intruder. These trigger molecules are allergens. The antibodies stick like suction cups to the allergens, setting off an immune system reaction. That process leads to common allergy symptoms: sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, itchy, watery eyes, and a cough. These symptoms can be annoying but minor.\nAllergies can also cause a life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical attention. For example, if someone ate a food they were allergic to, and then had throat swelling and a rash, that would be considered anaphylaxis.\nThe traditional treatment for anaphylaxis is a shot of the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the leg muscle. Allergy sufferers can also carry\u00a0an auto-injector\u00a0to give themselves an emergency shot in case of a life-threatening case of anaphylaxis. An epinephrine nasal spray is now available, too, which also works very quickly.\nA person can be allergic to things outdoors, like grass or tree pollen and bee stings, or indoors, like pets and tiny bugs called dust mites that hang out in carpets and mattresses.\nA person can also be allergic to foods. Food allergies\u00a0affect 4% to 5% of the population. The most common are to cow's milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish and sesame. Sometimes people\u00a0grow out of allergies, and sometimes they are lifelong.\nEach antibody has a specific target, which is why some people may only be allergic to one thing.\nThe antibodies responsible for allergies also take care of\u00a0cleaning up any parasites\u00a0that your body encounters. Thanks to modern medicine, people in the United States rarely deal with parasites. Those antibodies are still ready to fight, though, and sometimes they misfire at silly things, like pollen or food.\nHygiene and the environment around you can also play a role in how likely it is you'll develop allergies. The\u00a0more different kinds of bacteria\u00a0that you're exposed to earlier in life, the\u00a0less likely you are to develop allergies. Studies have even shown that children who\u00a0grow up on farms, children who have pets\u00a0before the age of five, and children who have a lot of siblings are less likely to develop allergies. Being breastfed as a baby can also\u00a0protect against having allergies.\nChildren who\u00a0grow up in cities\u00a0are more likely to develop allergies, probably due to air pollution, as are children who are\u00a0often around people who smoke.\nChildren are less likely to develop food allergies if they\u00a0try foods early in life\u00a0rather than waiting until they are older. Sometimes a\u00a0certain job can contribute\u00a0to an adult developing environmental allergies. For example, hairdressers, bakers and car mechanics can develop allergies due to chemicals they work with.\nGenetics can also play a huge role in why some people develop allergies. If a parent has environmental or food allergies, their child is more likely to have allergies. Specifically for peanut allergies, if your parent or sibling is allergic to peanuts, you are\u00a0seven times more likely\u00a0to be allergic to peanuts.\nBack to the idea of twins: yes, they can be allergic to the same things, but not always.\nResearchers in Australia found that 60% to 70% of twins in one study\u00a0both had environmental allergies, and identical twins were more likely to share allergies than fraternal (nonidentical) twins. Identical twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins only share about 50% of their genes, the same as any pair of siblings.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Climate change is making allergies worse\n\u2022 Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear with allergies\n\u2022 The science of probiotics and skin\nA lot more research has been done on the genetics of food allergies. One peanut allergy study found that\u00a0identical twins were more likely\u00a0to both be allergic to peanuts than fraternal twins were.\nSo, twins can be allergic to the same things, and it's more likely that they will be, based on their shared genetics and growing up together. But twins aren't automatically allergic to the exact same things.\nImagine if two twins are separated at birth and raised in different homes: one on a farm with pets and one in the inner city. What if one's parents smoke, and the others don't? What if one lives with a lot of siblings and the other is an only child? They certainly could develop different allergies, or maybe not develop allergies at all.\nScientists like me are continuing to research allergies, and we hope to have more answers in the future.\nBreanne Hayes Haney is an immunologist specialising in allergies at West Virginia University in the US.\u00a0\n* This article\u00a0is adapted from a piece that\u00a0originally appeared\u00a0in The Conversation's Curious Kids series, where experts answer questions from children, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, \nsign up for The Essential List newsletter\n \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on \nFacebook\n, \nX \nand \nInstagram\n.

        "article_text": "BBC film critics Caryn James and Nicholas Barber pick their cinema highlights of the year so far, from a brutal war epic to an ambitious period vampire drama.\nThe sharpest American indie film of the year so far, Companion stars Jack Quaid and Sophie Thatcher as a devoted young couple who go to stay with some friends in a Russian tycoon's remote forest getaway. (Rupert Friend has a hilarious cameo as the mulleted oligarch.) As a drunken evening of confessions, suspicions and disagreements unfolds, it seems at first if the film might be a romantic comedy, or maybe a noirish thriller about a robbery gone wrong. In fact, Companion is a science-fiction comedy thriller \u2013 but beyond that, the less you know about the film in advance, the more enjoyable its many ingenious twists and turns will be. Suffice it to say that the big-screen debut of writer-director Drew Hancock is a sparklingly entertaining satire on modern technology and the never-more-relevant topic of how entitled and misogynistic certain insecure young men can be. And it packs all of its ideas into 97 minutes. (NB)\nAs stunning as Ryan Coogler's Black Panther was, he has outdone himself with Sinners. Michael B Jordan is slyly convincing as twins named Smoke and Stack, who return from Chicago to their home town in Mississippi, in the Jim Crow South in 1932, to open a juke joint. With huge ambition and imagination, Coogler swirls familiar genres and tropes into a wholly original film that blurs the real and the supernatural. Sinners is a period piece as well as a vampire film. It is a drama about racism, family, superstition and spirituality, and it comes with passionate sex and exhilarating blues music. Coogler directs with brio, at times creating a phantasmagoria in which robed African musicians appear next to rappers. The first hour is so full of texture it could stand alone as a period film, but the supernatural eventually intrudes, leading to a finale of action, blood and vengeance. Jordan is surrounded by a superb supporting cast, including Delroy Lindo, Wunmi Musaku and Hailee Steinfeld.\u00a0 Sex, blues and vampires at the door? What more can anyone want from a film? (CJ)\nMiranda Yousef's riveting documentary tells the stranger-than-fiction story of Thomas Kinkade, one of the biggest-selling artists in history. Critics dismissed his work as nauseatingly sickly, but in the 1990s and 2000s, there were shops all around the US devoted to Kinkade's sentimental pictures of cosy country cottages. Art for Everybody asks fascinating questions about who gets to decide what counts as legitimate art, and whether some paintings can be more moral than others \u2013 questions that resonate today, in light of the continuing culture wars in the US . But Yousef's delicately balanced and sensitive film is just as fascinating on personal issues as it is on sociopolitical ones. A key part of Kinkade's marketing was his carefully constructed public image as a devoutly Christian, all-American family man, and yet the so-called \"Painter of Light\" had a dark side, too. Did the pressures of being a squeaky-clean Dr Jekyll push him into becoming a self-destructive Mr Hyde? (NB)\nAlex Garland, the writer and director of Civil War, and Ray Mendoza, a veteran who was that film's military advisor, have created a harrowing, visceral, real-time drama that recreates an actual battle between Navy Seals and al-Qaeda jihadists. Garland's virtuoso technique and Mendoza's first-hand experience of war blend in a film of uncompromising focus, which plunges us into the intensity of combat without explanation or backstory. Yet the faces of Joseph Quinn, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai are enough to capture the fear and determination of being under siege. Creating characters far from the bravado of typical Hollywood war films, the actors depict courage in battle as a terror-filled endurance test. The film immerses us in that feeling. It is loud and intense, relentless in its barrage of grenades and gunfire, and when the cries of pain from the injured men start, they never stop. Warfare is a dazzling technical achievement but much more. Focusing on the personal cost of combat and violence itself rather than the politics of the Iraq conflict, it reinvents the war film with bracing freshness and immediacy. (CJ)\nBarry Keoghan, Christopher Abbott and Colm Meaney star in this dark and bloody western-style thriller about a feud between sheep farmers in remote rural Ireland. Meaney and Abbott (who speak their dialogue in Irish) play a laconic father and son who lose their two prize rams, only to discover that they have been stolen by their neighbour's shiftless son (Keoghan). Accusations are made, simmering resentments reach boiling point, and violence ensues \u2013 but then Christopher Andrews, the film's debut writer-director, rewinds his story and replays it from a revelatory new perspective. Suddenly, a hard-boiled story of crime and retribution becomes an aching tragedy about desperate economic hardship, youthful stupidity, male pride, and the traumas passed down from taciturn fathers to taciturn sons. Bring Them Down is tough to watch but it's beautifully shot, cleverly plotted and stunningly powerful. (NB)\nAlain Guiraudie's (Stranger by the Lake) engaging film is full of surprises. It starts as a drama about Jeremie, a young man returning to his small village in the lush French countryside for a funeral, then becomes a quietly comic take on desire along with a thriller about covering up a murder. The film deftly carries the audience with it through all these turns. Jeremie is an opportunist but also an enigma. He may have had a passion for his former boss and mentor, the village baker, who died. The baker's widow definitely seems interested in Jeremie, who grew up as the best friend of her son, Vincent; he now angrily suspects Jeremie of wanting to sleep with his mother. Jeremie does not want that but he does find himself in a reluctant affair with the local priest. The joke is that so many people lust after the unremarkable Jeremie, and the suspense comes from the small-town eyes and local police wondering what happened when Vincent mysteriously disappears. Misericordia (Latin for mercy) was nominated for eight Cesar awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars, including film and director, but its human comedy lands easily with audiences everywhere. (CJ)\nDeep in the leafy French countryside, a scruffy teenage layabout Totone (Cl\u00e9ment Faveau) has to look after his younger sister Claire (Luna Garret) after the sudden death of their father. His answer to their dire financial problems? Making award-winning luxury cheese. Louise Courvoisier's debut film is a heart-tugging coming-of-age drama, rooted in the soil of the Jura region where she grew up. She offers an earthy insider's view of how strenuous life can be for agricultural workers, and how wrenching it is when carefree youth turns to relentless, responsible adulthood. But she also fashions a warm, romantic, gorgeously scenic and ultimately hopeful tale of underdogs working together in the sunshine to improve their lives. Blessed are the cheesemakers, as Monty Python once put it. (NB)\nA giant, sloppy Great Dane tugs Naomi Watts around the streets of Manhattan, but by the end of this lovely film about affection and grief the physical comedy with the dog seems the least of it. Watts smoothly play Iris, a creative writing teacher whose best friend, Walter, a famous womanising author, kills himself. He leaves her his dog, Apollo, even though she lives in a one-room apartment in a pet-free building. Dealing with Apollo becomes a way for Iris to grapple with her feelings of love and loss for Walter, played by Bill Murray in flashback scenes filled with such wit and tenderness that they have a great impact in spite of his minimal screen time. Based on Sigrid Nunez's eloquent, acclaimed 2018 novel, the film was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose films include the underrated Montana Story (2021) with Haley Lu Richardson and Owen Teague. Avoiding mawkish clich\u00e9s, they have created a gem of a film that is funny and touching whether you are a pet lover or not. Come for the rambunctious Great Dane, stay for the beautifully rendered emotions. (CJ)\nAardman's two greatest heroes are back \u2013 and so is their sneakiest ever adversary, a diabolical penguin named Feathers McGraw. Directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, the Oscar-nominated Vengeance Most Fowl is chock-full of the qualities that make Wallace & Gromit's farcical adventures so cherished: the painstaking stop-motion claymation, the Heath Robinson-style gadgetry, the winking homages to classic cinema, the gleefully silly British humour, and the deep affection for the characters and their world. Above all, it a treat to see Feathers McGraw, more than 30 years after he was introduced in The Wrong Trousers. But there is more to the Bristol-based studio's new film than the nostalgic whimsy you would expect. When Wallace invents a robotic garden gnome that does all of Gromit's favourite gardening jobs (and that's even before it turns evil), the story takes a canalboat trip into Mission: Impossible territory by addressing fears about artificial intelligence. (NB)\nThe immensely talented director Rungano Nyoni, whose I Am Not a Witch (2017) won a Bafta for outstanding British debut, makes artful, accessible films of great visual panache. Her latest is a clear-eyed drama about cultural and generational conflict. The heroine, Shula, is a cosmopolitan woman recently returned from the city to her village in Zambia. Nyoni conveys this dissonance at once, as Shula drives home from a costume party dressed in a glittery silver helmet and dark glasses (an homage to a Missy Elliott video) and finds her Uncle Fred dead on a dirt road. As the story takes us into the family's traditional funeral rituals, it slowly reveals that Shula and two cousins had been abused by Fred as children, a reality their mothers put aside as they mourn their brother. Nyoni's style is realistic even as she drops in surreal images. The narrative about secrecy and the trauma of sexual assault builds in power right to the end, when Shula recalls a children's television programme and the title of this stunning film finally makes sense.

He had a chance to end only two frames behind, but another miss in frame eight helped O'Sullivan inch a step closer to the winning target in the best-of-25-frame match.\nO'Sullivan, Higgins and Williams all joined the professional tour in 1992, and 33 years later they remain formidable competitors on the biggest stages. With nine days remaining of this championship, they remain in the trophy hunt yet again.\nHiggins and Williams will play their first quarter-final session at 10:00 BST on Tuesday, with the second session at 19:00 on the same day, with the third session scheduled for 10:00 BST on Wednesday.\nThat schedule means the veteran campaigners face a lot of snooker in a short space of time.\nOn the match-up, Higgins said: \"It was different maybe 20-odd years ago when we were really big rivals - now we walk into the practice room and we give each other a nod as if to say: 'How are we still here competing with everybody?'\n\"It's incredible, and obviously you throw Ronnie into the mix as well - three special players.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, was full of admiration for the pair and said on BBC Two: \"If you need a man for the final frame - like Mark Williams, who finished in style today - it's John Higgins.\n\"All these years later, still doing the same thing, it was a pretty flawless final frame. He's just a remarkable player, he always has been. It's the sternest examination when you play John Higgins at the Crucible and he's still doing it now, which is an incredible achievement at his age.\"\nJohn Higgins and Xiao Guodong finished off their last-16 match late on Saturday evening after it had been scheduled to be completed by mid-afternoon\nThree-time world champion Williams held a 9-7 advantage after the second session on Friday and he took two of the first three frames on Saturday.\nQualifier Vafaei made breaks of 74 and 72 to narrow the gap to 11-10, but Williams was not to be denied and pressed on towards the winning post, fashioning a stylish 115 to seal his victory.\nThe second-round match between Higgins and Xiao was poised at 12-11 after the morning session but only seven of the scheduled nine frames could be completed.\nWith the afternoon session scheduled to begin at 14:30 BST, Higgins and Xiao were hauled off shortly before 14:15.\nHiggins squandered a glorious chance to wrap up victory as he led 53-33 in the 23rd frame but missed a black off the spot before Xiao kept his tournament hopes alive.\nThey resumed on the first available table on Saturday evening, and there was to be more drama. \nHiggins led 58-25 while in the reds in frame 24, only to miss a match-ball pink and lose the frame on the black as Xiao took it to a decider.\nBut Higgins made a break of 75 in the final frame to advance.\nAs well as his trophy wins, Higgins has lost in four further finals at the Crucible, gone out in the semi-finals on three occasions and fallen at the last-eight hurdle seven times, including the past two seasons.\nLuca Brecel, the 2023 world champion, received a standing ovation from the Crucible crowd after sensationally seizing a 7-1 lead against former runner-up Ding Junhui.\nBelgian Brecel went home after his first-round match on Thursday and booked a private jet to return to Sheffield on Saturday, arriving at the venue at 18:35 BST, only 25 minutes before the evening's play was due to start.\nIn a remarkable session, Ding made a break of 141 in frame one but then only scored 15 more points in the next seven frames as Brecel wowed the audience with an incredible display of attacking, near no-miss snooker.\nHe rattled in breaks of 121, 78, 55, 100, 88 and 89, meaning he only needs to win six more frames when play restarts at 14:30 BST on Sunday.\nIn the other second-round tie, Ben Woollaston, who defeated world number four Mark Selby in round one, trails 5-3 against China's Si Jiahui.\n'O'Sullivan definitely a contender'\n'National hero' - China's pursuit of an elusive world title\nKeeping up with the Woollastons - snooker's family affair\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

        "article_text": "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia.\nOutside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins.\nHome to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.\nFor Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.\nRunning the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.\nBurnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.\nStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.\nA once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.\nAs a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\nHealth has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.\nBut experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.\nAustralians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.\nHealthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.\nSeeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.\nThough she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.\n\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"\nWhen Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".\nHealth funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.\nPatients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.\nMedicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.\nFast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.\nThere is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.\nBut the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.\nThat is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.\nAccording to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.\nBut experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.\nBrisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.\n\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"\nAnd every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.\n\"[I] just can't keep up.\"\nThis is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. \nSo his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?\nThis year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.\nThe results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"\nAnd that's just primary care.\nPublic specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.\nThere are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.\nThe BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.\nOthers are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.\nKimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.\n\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.\n\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"\nAnother woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.\n\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.\nThe people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.\n\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.\nAll of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.\nEvery single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.\nStreaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.\nIt's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.\n\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.\n\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"\nShe came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.\nIt's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.\n\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.\nWhen the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.\nIt means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.\n\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.\nLike many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.\nThere's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.\nMany doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.\nHealth economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.\nThe taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.\n\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"\nThe original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.\nShe says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. \nBoth the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.\n\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.\nOn the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.\nHis government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.\nBut the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. \nProposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.\nOne Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.\nLabor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".\nBut many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. \nThere's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.\nExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.\nThat is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.\nAnd the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.\n\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.\nIn Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.\n\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.\n\"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\"",

That is ultimately why I am running the race, to make Rob proud.\"\nRob's MND diagnosis came two years after he retired from a stellar 17-year career at Leeds Rhinos, during which he made almost 500 appearances and won 13 trophies. \nWith the help of former team-mate and close friend Kevin Sinfield, they raised more than \u00a315 million for MND charities as Rob battled the disease himself. Both men were awarded CBEs in the 2024 New Year Honours.\n\"Rob will will be at the forefront of my mind.

Stewart, who had been training for the marathon when he was diagnosed, underwent successful surgery but the cancer returned a year later. \n\"A key thing for me has been that we can't have gone through this for no positive to come from it. I kept thinking, 'What can I do?' There was a lightbulb moment where I thought, 'I can do the marathon for him',\" Curtis told BBC Sport.\n\"My hope is that collectively all of us who are doing it on the day raise a significant amount of awareness for the charity, hopefully a huge amount of money, and that can prolong the life of a dad, a mum, a sister and allow them more time with their family.\"\nLondon Marathon\nSunday, 27 April from 08:30 BST\nWatch on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app\nWest Brom fan Dave Heeley will be raising money for the club's Albion Foundation\n\"Stubborn to a fault...

In 2011, he ran the length of the UK, completing 10 marathons in 10 days from John O'Groats to Land's End.\n\"I asked the question, 'Why me? What have I done to deserve this?'

        "article_text": "Ding Junhui (left) lost in the 2016 world final and Lei Peifan beat reigning world champion Kyren Wilson in the first round of this year's tournament\nPlayers from eight countries have won snooker's most prestigious title of world champion - but China is still waiting for its first success.\nCould 2025 be the year that changes?\nThis season's World Championship last 16 includes six Chinese players - Ding Junhui, Lei Peifan, Pang Junxu, Si Jiahui, Xiao Guodong and Zhao Xintong - with England having the next highest total with five.\n\"This has got to be the biggest year for China in terms of chances of having a world champion,\" said Jason Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).\n\"We've seen players like Lei Peifan winning ranking events and players bounce on to the scene and that could happen here. These boys have no fear and really want it.\n\"If a Chinese player became a world champion there's no doubt that player would become a national hero.\"\nTrailblazer Ding has come the closest to snooker's ultimate glory, losing 18-14 to Mark Selby in the 2016 final.\nOf the six Chinese players left in, four have won ranking tournaments, with two of those coming this season - Xiao at the Wuhan Open in October and Lei in the Scottish Open in December.\n\"There's been a big improvement in Chinese players,\" said Ding. \"In the past two or three seasons, they've improved so quickly.\n\"They're showing people how good they are and they've won tournaments, which says they've got the talent, skills and form to play anybody.\n\"It tells people they're ready to play the biggest tournament and hopefully one of them can win it. I would love to see a Chinese player win a World Championship - it would be great for Chinese snooker and also for the young ones to look at and start playing from a young age.\"\nDing Junhui won the first of his 15 ranking titles just after his 18th birthday at the China Open in 2005\nSince the turn of the century, there has been a British winner at the Crucible in every year apart from when Australian Neil Robertson triumphed in 2010 and Belgium's Luca Brecel took the 2023 title.\nBut a long-term aim from snooker bosses has been to grow the game globally.\n\"Most people thought this sport was very English and would remain this way, but we could see a real burning will to grow in these countries,\" said Ferguson.\nA pivotal moment in snooker's development came when it was added into the World Games in Akita, Japan in August 2001.\n\"That really changed the face of snooker,\" added Ferguson. \"I remember walking into the arena with my friends from Asia and we were carrying a banner in a stadium in front of 60,000 people which said 'Billiards Sports'.\n\"My friend said to me: 'Jason, remember this day, this day is when snooker becomes a sport.'\n\"We had taken this game which was doing well and very popular in England and had turned it into a sport.\"\nSnooker's popularity in China grew at a rapid rate, accelerating when a shy Ding, two days after his 18th birthday, defeated seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry to win the 2005 China Open, watched by a reported television audience of 110 million people in the country.\n\"Because of Ding, snooker now has a big market,\" said world number 12 Zhang Anda. \"Ding being world champion would be good for every player because China is a very big market. I hope he can win the first one.\"\n\"It's not just about major events in China, we've built Chinese snooker from the bottom up,\" said Ferguson.\n\"China embraced this sport and gave it a lot of love and care. The one thing China has got right is access to snooker facilities in schools and mainstream education. That's something we need here.\n\"The players are coming together in academies - there are three in Sheffield - and you find players playing against each other day in, day out and the standard of snooker is absolutely amazing.\"\nChinese snooker, and the sport in general, received a huge setback in June 2023 when 10 players from China received bans for their involvement in match-fixing.\nFormer Masters champion Yan Bingtao was among those banned, while Liang Wenbo and Li Hang were handed lifetime bans.\nZhao, a former UK Championship winner, served an 18-month ban and has been the only player to return after he had not directly thrown a match but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.\n\"It was a shame some players fell foul of the rules, it was a really sad time and difficult to deal with,\" said Ferguson.\n\"We kept close to our partners in China and the authorities in snooker. We worked together to educate players better and to ensure the players have opportunities. The sport has recovered and it has not stopped the talent coming through.\"\nHalo World Snooker Championship\n19 April to 5 May\nCrucible Theatre, Sheffield\nWatch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app; live text coverage of selected matches; updates on BBC Radio 5 Live\nPang Junxu beat compatriot Zhang Anda in the first round this year and will play Ronnie O'Sullivan in the last 16\nRobertson knows what it is like to break through the British dominance of snooker and felt the unity the Chinese players were showing this year was a massive boost.\nThe Australian added: \"Xiao Guodong said it's like 'Team China' and they are really happy for each other and I like that mindset. He said they're trying to take the burden off Ding and support him and they're in it together.\n\"The game is getting stronger and stronger in China and it makes first rounds in all tournaments harder as we're only going to get more Chinese players qualifying.\n\"They don't seem fazed by the Crucible and all seem to play well, even on debuts, so it's exciting for snooker. We're seeing a lot of international flags, which is great for the game.\"\nSo what happens to snooker if a Chinese player lifts the famous trophy on Monday, 5 May?\n\"It's something the authorities we've been working in China with have dreamed of, that one day they would have the world champion,\" said Ferguson.\n\"If a Chinese player wins it would be magical, a historical moment, a real shift in the sport, and I can't tell you the media frenzy it would cause for snooker around the world.\"",

England's series opener against the Windies is on 21 May.\nAsked about appointing a captain, Edwards told BBC Sport: \"We're very close, it hopefully will be very soon.\n\"I'm looking forward to that being announced, and we can get moving. And obviously, with a series coming up in May, that's going to be really important.\"\nKnight and former head coach Jon Lewis were both sacked following an awful winter in which England lost every match in the Ashes and went out of the T20 World Cup in the group stage.\nLegendary former England batter Edwards was appointed as Lewis' replacement earlier this month.\nEdwards had previously stated that the new captain should be an England regular in all three formats, narrowing the field to Sciver-Brunt and potentially spinner Sophie Ecclestone, who is not thought to be in contention.\nIn January, during the Ashes, Sciver-Brunt said she would \"love\" the opportunity to become captain.\nEdwards was speaking at the unveiling of a portrait of her in the Long Room at Lord's. The painting of the 45-year-old is just the third of a woman commissioned by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), following fellow England internationals Rachael Heyhoe Flint and Claire Taylor.\n\"Women's cricket has come a long way,\" said Edwards. \"To have a portrait of myself, up with some of the greats, it's quite overwhelming really. I'm hugely proud and really happy things have moved on. Women are allowed in this club and can experience this wonderful ground.\"\nEdwards, England's all-time leading runscorer, played more than 300 internationals between 1996 and 2016. In Edwards' 10-year spell as captain England won the Ashes three times, as well as both the 50-over and T20 World Cups.\nWhen Edwards first played at Lord's, in a one-day international against South Africa in 1997, women were still two years away from being allowed membership of the MCC and admittance to the Long Room.\n\"We were allowed in the changing room and down the stairs, then out by the committee room,\" said Edwards.\n\"It was a bit unusual. At the time I didn't really think anything of it. I just thought it was amazing to be playing at Lord's and I was overwhelmed by the occasion.\n\"I remember walking on to the turf and my legs just went to jelly.

Zelensky rejects this idea.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nOn Friday, traffic was halted in Moscow as a convoy of cars carrying Witkoff arrived ahead of the high-level talks, the fourth such visit he has made to Russia since the start of the year.\nThe three-hour talks were described as \"very useful\" by Putin aide Yuri Ushakov.\nIt had brought the \"Russian and US positions closer together, not just on Ukraine but also on a range of other international issues\", he said.\n\"Specifically on the Ukrainian crisis, the possibility of resuming direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives was in particular discussed,\" he added.\nEarlier this week, Putin signalled for the first time since the early stages of the war that he was open to talks with Zelensky.\nHis remarks were believed to be in response to a proposal by the Ukrainian president for a 30-hour Easter truce to be extended for 30 days. No truce has yet been agreed on.\nKyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war.\nCrimea has become a particular flashpoint.\nZelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea of recognising the peninsula as part of Russia, telling reporters in Kyiv on Friday: \"Our position is unchanged - only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian.\"\nHowever, in later remarks he suggested to the BBC that \"a full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything\".\nHe also referenced comments made by Trump in an interview with Time magazine, in which the US president said \"Crimea will stay with Russia\".\n\"What President Trump says is true, and I agree with him in that today we do not have enough weapons to return control over the Crimean peninsula,\" Zelensky said.\nWashington's peace plan has not been publicly released, but reports suggest it proposes Russia keeps the land it has gained - a condition that is in Moscow's favour.\nOn Friday, Reuters news agency reported it had seen US proposals handed to European officials last week, as well as subsequent counter-proposals from Europe and Ukraine.\nIt said there are significant disparities between them.\nThe US deal offers American legal acceptance of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas, including all of the Luhansk region.\nBy contrast, the Europeans and Ukrainians will only discuss what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory after a ceasefire has come into effect.\nThe US plan also rules out Ukraine's membership in the Nato military alliance, according to Reuters.\nAs the meeting between Witkoff and Putin was taking place, Trump claimed talks were going in the right direction.\n\"They're meeting with Putin right now, as we speak, and we have a lot of things going on, and I think in the end we're going to end up with a lot of good deals, including tariff deals and trade deals,\" he told reporters in the US.\nHe said his aim was to bring about an end to fighting in Ukraine which he said was claiming the lives of 5,000 Ukrainian and Russians a week, adding he believed \"we're pretty close\" to a peace deal.\nTrump also said Zelensky had not signed the \"final papers on the very important Rare Earths Deal with the United States\". \n\"It is at least three weeks late,\" he said, adding that he hoped it would be signed \"immediately\".\nThe long-talked of minerals deal, which would give the US a stake in Ukraine's abundant natural resource deposits, was meant to be signed in February but was derailed after an acrimonious meeting between Trump and Zelensky in Washington.\nRussia and Ukraine's positions in securing a peace deal still seem miles apart, with no representative from Ukraine invited to take part in the talks in Moscow.\nWriting on social media on Friday, Zelensky criticised Russia for failing to agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US on 11 March and urged allies to apply more pressure to it.\n\"It's been 45 days since Ukraine agreed to President Trump's proposal for quiet in the sky, sea and the frontline,\" he said. \"Russia rejects all this. Without pressure this cannot be resolved. Pressure on Russia is necessary.\"\nHe said Russia was being allowed to import missiles from countries such as North Korea, which he said it then used in a deadly missile strike on Kyiv on Thursday, which killed 12 people and injured dozens.\n\"Insufficient pressure on North Korea and its allies allows them to make such ballistic missiles. The missile that killed the Kyiv residents contained at least 116 parts imported from other countries, and most of them, unfortunately, were made by US companies,\" Zelensky alleged.\nFollowing the attack on Kyiv, Trump said he was \"putting a lot of pressure\" on both sides to end the war, and directly addressed Putin in a post on social media, saying: \"Vladimir STOP!\"\nSince then, however, Trump has blamed Kyiv for starting the war, telling Time magazine: \"I think what caused the war to start was when they [Ukraine] started talking about joining Nato.\"\nAhead of the talks between Witkoff and Putin, a senior Russian general was killed in a car bomb attack in the Russian capital. The Kremlin accused Ukraine of being responsible. Kyiv has not commented.",

Along with the greater use of visual aids, the key to successful sessions, explains Grace, was the ability to demonstrate and emphasise exercises.\nA rare positive legacy of the pandemic was the passing of the British Sign Language Act 2022, which made BSL one of the recognised languages of Great Britain.\nWhen she first won the NACs in 2023, Buckle was a novice boxing out of Miquel's gym in Brixton.\nHer triumph at the NACs, when she beat Emily Asquith, a European champion at youth level - despite only having one amateur bout and a handful of white-collar fights under her belt - provided the foundation for a rapid rise.\nBuckle subsequently beat the Kazak Lazzat Kungeibayeva, previously a gold medallist at the world championships, at her first overseas tournament for England.\nShe would go on to win the 2023 Haringey Box Cup, another NAC gold medal in 2024 and the Golden Girl tournament in Sweden in 2025.\n\"You do get natural born fighters,\" says Quinton Shillingford, Buckle's current coach.\n\"It's not just a question of technique and motivation, it's about whether you keep coming forward when you are hurt and have taken a shot.\n\"Grace's mum and dad are both deaf and I know she takes inspiration from them.\n\"She's always saying 'my mum is so strong'. She knows the difficulties they have had to navigate.\"\nBack in the ring, Buckle has not had things all her own way.\nA loss to Celine Lee-Lo of New Zealand at Haringey last year was the catalyst for a move to Shillingford's Heart of Portsmouth gym and her triumph at this years NACs.\n\"I used to think it was a clich\u00e9, but there is a lot of wisdom in the idea, 'that it's not a loss, it's a learning',\" Buckle says.\nClaressa Shields (L) recently fired the women's heavyweight division into the mainstream by becoming undisputed champion\nThe heavyweight division is generally the glamour weight class in boxing, housing the biggest stars and attracting the most attention.\nThe UK's biggest attractions of recent years has been Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury's run as heavyweight world champions.\nBut the women's weight category that has hitherto been neglected.

        "article_text": "River's Franco Mastantuono and Boca's Edinson Cavani will likely play key roles on Sunday\nWhen it comes to football derbies, very little comes close to matching the passion, intensity and cultural significance of Argentina's Superclasico between River Plate and Boca Juniors.\nSuperstar players, fanatical fans, regular helpings of drama and the sinister side of the game - the Superclasico has it all.\nOn Sunday, River's 85,000-capacity Mas Monumental stadium will host the 264th Superclasico on matchday 15 of the Torneo Apertura, the first half of the Argentine top-flight season. \nBoca are looking to avenge a 1-0 home defeat in September and clinch top spot in Apertura Zone A, while River need to build momentum before the knockout rounds after a mixed start to the season.\nWhatever the outcome, it promises to be some spectacle.\nNot only are River and Boca local rivals in Buenos Aires, they are the two biggest clubs in Argentina and indeed two of the superpowers in South America. As many as 80% of Argentines support one of the two clubs.\nTheir trophy cabinets match their popularity.\nRiver have 38 top-flight titles and four Copas Libertadores to their name, while Boca have won the league title on 35 occasions and the Libertadores on six, with three of those triumphs coming during a golden age between 2000 and 2003.\nBoth have also counted some of the greatest players of all time among their ranks. \nRiver alumni include Alfredo di Stefano, Enzo Francescoli and Daniel Passarella, while Boca fans have worshipped Carlos Tevez, Juan Roman Riquelme and Diego Maradona.\nThere is naturally a lot at stake on derby day - Boca fans take great pride in the fact they lead River 92 wins to 87 in the overall Superclasico record. But the rivalry goes way beyond 90 minutes on a football pitch.\n\"It is rooted in their origins, or rather their respective foundational myths,\" Argentine football journalist Santi Bauza tells BBC Sport.\nThe close geographical proximity of the clubs when they were founded - River in 1901 and Boca four years later - created tension.\nOne fan is said to have burned the flag of the opposition during one early meeting, while a Superclasico in 1931 was abandoned after 31 minutes because of mass fighting.\nThe schism widened when River Plate - after joining their rivals in the working-class neighbourhood of La Boca - relocated to the well-to-do suburb of Recoleta up the road, then further north to Nunez, where they reside today.\nDeserting their working-class home and spending big on players - the 35,000 pesos (\u00a31,350) fee paid for Bernabe Ferreyra in 1932 set an Argentine transfer record that stood for 20 years - led to River becoming known as 'Los Millonarios'. The Millionaires.\nBy contrast, Boca have always remained in their spiritual home, the famous La Bombonera stadium that is seemingly dropped into the middle of the 'barrio', a high-poverty district of the city.\nTheir Italian immigrant, working-class roots are a central part of their identity. Little shows this more than the club's nickname 'Xeneize', which comes from the Ligurian dialect word for Genoese.\nA Superclasico without some sort of scuffle does not feel like a Superclasico\nThe division between the clubs is reflected on the pitch in both playing styles and full-blooded encounters.\n\"River have traditionally favoured a more aesthetic brand of football, with their more demanding fans barely even celebrating hard-fought or undeserved wins,\" explains Bauza. \nRiver fans often speak of the three Gs - Gustar (to play well), Ganar (to win) and Golear (to score lots of goals).\n\"Our club is known for its beautiful style of play, excellent ball control, an attacking mindset, and a philosophy that sees attacking the opposition's goal as the best form of defence,\" River club president Jorge Brito tells BBC Sport.\nThat mentality is juxtaposed by the popular Boca motto 'transpira a la camiseta', which means to 'make the shirt sweat'. Passion and fight are non-negotiable.\n\"Boca pride themselves in being a win-at-all-costs kind of side,\" says Bauza.\n\"Over the years they have both become so massive and ubiquitous in Argentine society that the rich-poor narrative doesn't hold up as much now, but they are still largely identified by those footballing philosophies.\"\nInsult culture in Argentina has given rise to some incredibly petty nicknames.\nSince throwing away a half-time lead to lose to Penarol in the 1966 Copa Libertadores final, Boca fans have called River 'Gallinas' - 'little chickens'.\nIn a 2004 Superclasico, Boca striker Carlos Tevez was sent off for performing a chicken dance in celebration.\nBoca are known as 'Los Bosteros' - 'the manure handlers' - as a factory that used horse manure to make bricks once stood behind La Bombonera. Opposition players have been known to hold their noses when entering the pitch.\nBoca's La Bombonera stadium often shakes during matches\nArgentina is obsessed with football, so it is no surprise that meetings between its two biggest clubs are seismic events.\n\"The Superclasico stops the country in its tracks,\" says Bauza.\n\"Regardless of their form or success, it's always a game that defines the mood of players, managers, pundits and fans alike.\n\"Storylines can emerge or change overnight depending on what happens.\"\nOne of the main highlights of the Superclasico is actually what happens in the stands rather than on the pitch.\nGiant tifos and choreographed displays are common, singing is non-stop and the atmosphere is spine-tingling.\nBut there is a dark side to the world's most intense derby.\nThe Barras Brava - a gang-like organised fan group - rule the terraces in Argentina and have huge influence over club issues like ticketing, merchandising and car parking.\nRiver Plate's Mas Monumental stadium can accommodate 85,000 people after expansion\nAlthough they bring the noise and passion that makes Argentine football so special, their intrinsic links to organised crime, violence and homicide can make stadiums dangerous places.\nWhen River were relegated to the second division in 2011 for the first time in their history, the players were locked inside the dressing room for three hours while fans rioted and burned parts of El Monumental.\nIn 2015 Boca were thrown out of the Libertadores when the River squad were sprayed with pepper spray when emerging for the second half.\nThe second leg of the 2018 Libertadores final - the highest-profile game in Superclasico history - was postponed after police tear gas, used to disperse River fans who had smashed windows on the Boca bus with projectiles as it sped towards Mas Monumental, affected the visiting players.\nThe competition - named after those who liberated South America from Spanish rule - was concluded in Madrid.\nWhile River are assured of a place in the last 16 of the Apertura and top their Libertadores group, a mixture of pre-season squad upheaval and injuries have contributed to an inconsistent start to the year.\nBut beat Boca on Sunday and everything will look a lot rosier.\n\"It is always special. This game is the one you wait for, and nothing else matters when it comes to how it feels to win or lose against them,\" says journalist and River fan Andres Bruckner.\nWhile Boca have had a week to prepare, River flew more than six hours to Ecuador for a 2-2 draw with Independiente del Valle in the Libertadores on Wednesday.\n\"I always think we will win, but playing Libertadores midweek makes things tricky,\" says Bruckner.\n\"In moments like these, with so many doubts, a defeat would put a great question mark over all the players, and supporters will show anger.\"\nWith 85,000 fans now able to cram into the recently expanded Mas Monumental, the pressure to win has never been greater.\n\"I wouldn't mind losing five games in a row if we get the win on Sunday,\" admits broadcaster and River fan Juan Igal. \n\"Boca is the thing I hate the most, and seeing the sadness in their fans and players makes me happy.\"\nRiver Plate won the most recent Superclasico, a 1-0 victory at Boca's La Bombonera in September\nWith many of the players responsible for River's success in recent years now moved on - the sales of Julian Alvarez and Claudio Echeverri to Manchester City typify the struggle of Argentine clubs to retain their best young talent - manager Marcelo Gallardo has placed a lot of faith in 17-year-old starlet Franco Mastantuono.\nBoca started the season poorly - they won just one of their opening four Apertura games and were eliminated in the Libertadores qualifiers - but nine wins in their last 10 league games have sent them three points clear at the top of the table.\nCarlos Palacios and Kevin Zenon have stood out for Boca this season, while the likes of Edinson Cavani and Luis Advincula provide experience and relative calm.\n\"Boca fans die for every game, but we live for Copa Libertadores nights and Superclasicos. It's a game unlike any other,\" says Rodrigo Azurmendi, Boca fan and co-host of the Boca in English Podcast.\n\"Winning means going all out on the jokes, the memes and the folklore against our friends on the other side. Losing means skipping work on Monday.\"\nFor some, the idea of defeat on Sunday is too much to bear. \n\"I can't think about losing, I just don't have it in me,\" Boca fan Rob Smith says.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

That is the dismal record of Wales' two national sides in the 2025 Six Nations in the space of 86 difficult days. \nFrom the 43-0 Friday night Paris mauling dished out by France to Wales' men's side in January, to the 44-12 hammering inflicted by Italy's women in late April, it has been a miserable and tumultuous three months.\nIf Welsh rugby's new performance director Dave Reddin needed a reminder of the monumental task he is taking on, he would have just had to watch events unfold in Parma on Sunday.\nThe manner in which Wales women miserably collapsed against Italy in the second-half of the Six Nations finale demonstrated how much Reddin has to do to lift Wales from almost rock bottom. \nSean Lynn's side became the first Wales women's team to lose all five matches in a Six Nations tournament.\nThe men have managed that dubious accolade in successive years, with Wales propping up the Six Nations table in 2024 and 2025.\nThere has only been one win in the 20 matches played in the four tournaments over the last 16 months - Wales women sneaking a victory against Italy at Principality Stadium in April 2024, a triumph celebrated as if the hosts had won the World Cup. \nReddin used phrases like \"low ebb\" to describe Welsh rugby in his opening press conference last week. He was not wrong. \nNow the former FA and Team GB performance expert has the unenviable task of transforming Wales' sorry national sides, with at least 11 more fixtures on the calendar in 2025.\nHis new employers, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), has overseen a couple of years of misery.

        "article_text": "Canadians will head to the elections on 28 April, with polls suggesting a tight race between the ruling Liberals and the opposition Conservatives.\nWhile Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.\nIt will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the frontrunners in the race are Liberal leader Mark Carney and leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre.\nHere is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major political parties.\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few weeks.\nHis party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader in early March. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.\nFor many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.\nHe was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. \nCarney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.\nBut Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. \nHe is not as fluent in French as his opponents, though that has yet to be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec.\nHe has faced some criticism for taking multiple breaks during the campaign - amid a trade war with the US - to focus on his role as prime minister. \nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.\nSince then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.\nHe is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government.\nIt is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. \nPoilievre led in national polls from mid-2023 until this March, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election. \nBut a series of events - Trudeau's resignation, Trump's inauguration, and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader - has made this election a much tighter race. \nPoilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".\nPoilievre has sought to shift his messaging, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first\".\n\"I have a completely different story from Donald Trump,\" he said in a recent media appearance, highlighting his modest background. \nTrump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec sovereignist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.\nStill, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.\nBlanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, and has called Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs last month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nOn domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table.\nHe has said he wants Quebec to be a strong ally with Canada in trade talks with the US. \nQuebec - with a large aluminium industry - has been hit hard by the US tariffs of 25%. \nStill, polling indicates the Bloc - who went into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\nCBC's poll tracker suggests the Liberals are polling at around 43% in the province, and the Bloc around 23%. \nBlanchet has suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practicing Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.\nIn 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.\nThe NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\nBut in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.\nAt the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\nBut his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls suggest that only 8.5% of Canadians nationally intend to vote for them as of mid-April.\nA big question will be whether the NDP will be able to retain the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. \nIn the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.",

        "article_text": "As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.\nThere's a cold wind blowing from the \u00d8resund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.\u00a0\nThis windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2006.\u00a0\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\u00a0\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" \u2013 the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure \u2013 it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsing\u00f8r \u2013 the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg \u2013\u00a0but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon \u2013 and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer \u2013 as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\u00a0\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer, special tours invite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father \u2013 but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto \u2013 written very early in 1603 \u2013 is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsing\u00f8r.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director of HamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town's Shakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatre Schaub\u00fcne and a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022 Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n\u2022 Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists \u2013 but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry \u2013 starring a young Claes Bang as Rosenkrantz \u2013 and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\u00a0\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\u00a0\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\u00a0\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said that every minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

The firm's shares fell after it withdrew its annual results forecast. \n\"The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,\" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call.\nSkechers - like rivals Nike, Adidas and Puma - uses factories in Asia, particularly in China, to make its products.\nComments from Procter & Gamble (P&G) executives also hinted at how tariffs could mean higher prices for its customers.\nThe maker of Ariel, Head & Shoulders and Gillette said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places. It also said it expected sales to grow this year less than previously forecast.\n\"We'll be looking for every opportunity to mitigate the impact,\" said Andre Schulten, P&G's financial chief, adding that there will be adjustments to \"some level of consumer pricing\".\nThe Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven convenience stores, Seven & I, said it is also feeling the impact of the trade tensions.\nNorth America account for more than 70% of its sales. \nIts incoming chief executive, Stephen Dacus, told the BBC about the uncertainty faced by the business.\n\"We don't know what those tariffs are going to be.

        "article_text": "As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.\nThere's a cold wind blowing from the \u00d8resund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.\u00a0\nThis windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2006.\u00a0\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\u00a0\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" \u2013 the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure \u2013 it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsing\u00f8r \u2013 the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg \u2013\u00a0but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon \u2013 and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer \u2013 as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\u00a0\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer, special tours invite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father \u2013 but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto \u2013 written very early in 1603 \u2013 is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsing\u00f8r.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director of HamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town's Shakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatre Schaub\u00fcne and a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022 Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n\u2022 Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists \u2013 but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry \u2013 starring a young Claes Bang as Rosenkrantz \u2013 and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\u00a0\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\u00a0\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\u00a0\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said that every minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.\nTen of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.\nOnly Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.\nThe exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.\nCommentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.\nWhile plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.\nHere I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.\nSouth America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.\nThe US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.\nFor example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.\nThere is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.\nWith the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.\nThese include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.\nHe tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".\nHowever, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.\nSo his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.\n\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.\nYet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.\nTake the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.\nJapan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.\nOther Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.\nBrazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.\nTrump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.\nThis would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.\nMeanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place. \nThe other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.\nUruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.\nHe said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.\nYou may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.\nWhether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.\nFirstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.\nThe US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.\nBrazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.\nArgentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.\n\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.\nTrump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.\nEduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.\nLooking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.\nAfter all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.\nMr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"\nHe theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.\nSo, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.\nAs Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"\nSubject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.\nBut adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"\n",

        "article_text": "A young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.\nIn a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.\nOften sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.\nTaking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.\nDespite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".\nThe medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.\nHer estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.\nIn the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing.'\"\nThe few posts he has made are accompanied by hashtags such as #divorcetrauma - saying the accusations are lies.\nNonetheless, the comments section on Dr Ndaba's TikTok and other social media platforms have transformed into support groups, filled with female breadwinners sharing eerily similar stories.\n\"You are brave to speak out so publicly\u2026 I have been suffering in silence,\" one person commented.\nBertus Preller, a lawyer based in Cape Town, believes this is because although South African women are becoming doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, getting well-paid jobs does not necessarily free them from the clutches of the patriarchy.\nWomen's financial independence clashes with \"cultural norms that prioritise male authority\", he says.\nIf anything, their success appears to make them targets.\nFinancial abuse occurs when one partner dominates or exploits the other's financial resources, the lawyer explains.\n\"It is a subtle yet potent tactic of domestic violence, aimed at keeping the victim under control,\" he says.\nIn South Africa, this is legally classified as economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.\nMr Preller says things like \"unjustly withholding money for essentials or interfering with shared assets,\" are covered by the act.\nA university lecturer, who requested anonymity, told the BBC how her husband had lied about his qualifications and eventually left her in financial ruin.\nIt started with her car that he mostly drove but never refuelled. Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.\nDespite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive.\n\"He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall,\" she said.\nEven when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute.\n\"He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone,\" she said.\nLegal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots.\n\"For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance,\" she told the BBC.\n\"For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing.\"\nResearch from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.\nOut of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married.\n\"For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence\u2026 All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider,\" said researcher Bianca Parry.\nMs Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: \"This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally.\n\"This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics.\"\nNombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited.\n\"Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.\nShe explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.\nSince Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.\nFor Ms Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.\n\"You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind.

'Double patriarchy': doctor has South Africa talking about financial abuse14 hours agoShareSaveDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsShareSaveCeliwe Ndaba / FacebookDr Celiwe Ndaba said that once she decided to refuse to pay for her husband's lifestyle he left their marriageA young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.In a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.Often sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.Taking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.Despite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".The medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.Her estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.In the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing. \"Nombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited. \"Research from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.Out of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.She explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.Since Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.For Ms Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.",

It's going to be exciting, the first six rounds will be explosive.''\nRetired world champion Tony Bellew: ''I think Conor Benn will get to Eubank. If he does get through those first five or six rounds, he's took what Conor's got and he starts unloading himself. It's a fight of two halves. Neither's defence is that good and both of them want to get at to each other, bad.''\nRetired world champion Barry Jones: \"I think Eubank wins on points. Benn might be able to tough it out as he is a tough kid, but I don't know if he has the ability. Eubank can't make middleweight no more, it drains him and he beat an old Liam Smith in their rematch. But he's a massive guy, so if he's able to rehydrate correctly, he is just too fast and too big.\"\nHeavyweight Fabio Wardley: \"My initial feeling is Eubank will get the win. The weight factor will play quite a big part, asking Benn to come up two weights is a lot against someone who is naturally comfortable fighting at that weight. Benn can carry some strong power at his weight, but there is a large difference when those punches which you hit in your previous weight would take them out but a bigger guy is more used to taking bigger shots and they don't have the same effect.\"\nScotland's first female world champion Hannah Rankin: \"I think it will be a later-round stoppage from Eubank. Experience and size is in his favour. I will be very surprised if Benn gets the win. Eubank is stronger. He's been in there with solid opponents that have tested his chin. I'm surprised how many people see this as a 50-50.\"\nUnbeaten light-welterweight Adam Azim: \"Benn to knock him out. He's the younger fighter, very powerful.

I want Eubank to win for selfish reasons and wanting to fight him in the future, but I feel like Benn will do the job.\"\nHeavyweight Delicious Orie: \"I see Eubank doing the job. It will be a great fight but Eubank edges it. He has the experience and weight advantage. I think he's probably got into Benn's head a little bit as well in the press conferences. It's more than just about the physicality of it, it's about the mental side too.\" \nScotland's former undisputed light-welterweight world champion Josh Taylor: \"Eubank is the naturally bigger and more experienced opponent but Benn is a young, hungry lion. He has the advantage of not having to cut weight and to be able to get bigger and stronger. He also has youth on his side. But my head is going with Eubank.\" \nBenn's promoter, Eddie Hearn: \"Benn has to start fast in this fight, he has to land and he has to hurt him early and get his respect and, quite frankly, get him out of there. I think we need him out in six rounds. He lands early, clean and cold, and I believe Eubank is stopped.\"\nLight-heavyweight Lyndon Arthur: \"I think Benn's going to come out and he might shock Eubank. He could get caught coming in though.\"\nCruiserweight Cheavon Clarke: \"I'm on the fence. Maybe a draw.\"\nFormer light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith: \"I find it hard to pick a winner, I won't be surprised with either result. I do edge towards Benn winning on points.\"\nEubank's promoter, Ben Shalom: \"I think Eubank wins by knockout. It will be a frantic first two or three rounds and then it will calm down and Eubank will take over. A knockout in round six.\"\nBritish heavyweight Derek Chisora: \"The smart money is on Eubank. He had fights when Benn was on holiday. But I'm friends with Benn, he comes to my house so my money is on him. I'm 50/50 but I'll go with Benn because I want him to win because of his family and legacy.\"\nFormer cruiserweight world champion Johnny Nelson: \"I'm saying Eubank because he had more consistency in his career. Benn's style is so ferocious and attacking that should suit Eubank in the first six rounds.\"\nLight-heavyweight Anthony Yarde: \"If Benn wins it is because he goes in with controlled aggression and detonates when he needs to. If Benn hurts Eubank then he is good at finishing. If Eubank wins then it's being himself but an aggressive version of himself. He needs to be switched on. The version we saw in his second fight against Liam Smith. Eubank is a world-class operator and he has shown that.\"\nEubank Sr's former promoter Barry Hearn: \"I think this is a 50-50 fight - of course I'm on Conor's side, but I'm not going to ignore that the other man is a much bigger man with more experience. It is going to be something awesome. I think Nigel will have Conor ready for war but in a more controlled way.\"\nSuper-bantamweight Francesca Hennessy: \"They're both great fighters.

        "article_text": "The creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.\nWhen news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, had resurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.\nThe story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. \"I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,\" Martin wrote on his blog.\nMartin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.\u00a0\nColossal \u2013 which is currently valued at $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA \u2013 boldly states on its website that it's \"going to fix\" the problem of extinction.\nAccording to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. \"We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,\" James tells the BBC.\u00a0\u00a0\nDe-extinction has been talked about for decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves \u2013 which are actually grey wolves that possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features \u2013 represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.\nIn the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.\nThe BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.\nChief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.\nSuch a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing from international agreements on climate change and revoking measures intended protect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.\n\"It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,\" he says.\nThis worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior \u2013 who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement \u2013 praised the company's work on X as a new \"bedrock for modern species conservation\". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the \"endangered species list\" \u2013 presumably a reference to the Red List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government \u2013 thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. \"Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation \u2013 not regulation \u2013 that has spawned American greatness,\" he wrote.\nBiodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons, according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.\nColossal claims that its de-extinction work will directly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to \"ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list\" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.\nWhile Colossal's de-extinction work is \"super-cool science,\" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.\nColossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats' resilience to climate change through their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.\u00a0\nHowever, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparing carbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forest found the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.\nSome research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they can reduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggests bison and horses could replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained at high densities \u2013 where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans \u2013 to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is also different today than it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.\nThere could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun \u2013 an effect that some research suggests is already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.\u00a0\n\"Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,\" Sekar says. \"It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.\"\u00a0\nJames calls for more research to resolve these questions and show \"direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey\".\nDire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.\nModern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.\n\"That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,\" she says. \"If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.\"\nJulie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as the northern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. \"These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,\" she says.\n\"I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,\" she adds. \"That is unfortunate.\"\nJames at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just \"one piece of a very complex puzzle\" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like \"a giant ship\" pulling \"all these other projects in its wake\".\u00a0\nIt is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. \"What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.\"\u00a0\nThis in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.\nIn the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality \"genetically modified grey wolves\", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.\nBut scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white \"because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones\", Gill says. \"This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.\"\nEven if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. \"A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.\"\nColossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.\nIn the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants \u2013 extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings \u2013 should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer from infertility and lose their calves to stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothers deeply mourn dead calves. \"Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?\" asks Sekar.\nJames says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to \"avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead\".\u00a0\nColossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme \u2013 but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.\nWhile Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being \"the right investment to make\".\nFor every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.\u00a0\nBut while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, their biggest threats are road collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing \"how the animal is going to survive on the ground\", the genetic component becomes \"kind of irrelevant\".\u00a0\nHerpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, , who has reviewed data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around two wild elephants are known to die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.\u00a0\nColossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways to engineer high quality animal proteins for human consumption could, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.\u00a0\n\"Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,\" Sekar says. \"If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In the 20 years since its creation, YouTube has grown from humble beginnings to billions of videos being watched every day - but can posting videos on the platform offer a viable career? We spoke to some of South Yorkshire's favourite creators about how the website changed their lives.\nRuth Amos from Sheffield runs Kids Invent Stuff. The channel has 71,000 followers and has been going since 2015. \nPrimary school children send in their invention ideas and Ruth and her colleague Shawn bring them to life.\n\"There's lots of different ways that you can make money from YouTube, there's ads, sponsors, collaborators or you can have things like Patreon, where people support the work that you're doing. \n\"Quite often, it you're a content creator you do a lot of those different ways, not just one of those things,\" she says.\n\"When I was growing up you couldn't watch someone's channel about robot making or cookery and that's what's amazing about YouTube \u2013 all of our hobbies have found a home on there as well as some of those viral moments.\"\nThe channel has run collaborations with Channel 4 TV show Taskmaster and had a go at breaking Guinness World Records. \nAccording to Ofcom, more than 80% of three to 17-year-olds use the site. A survey by the Lego Group in 2019 suggested a third of young Britons and Americans wanted to be vloggers. \nHowever, there are more than 100 million channels on the site - some with only a handful of followers or video watches.\nWould Ruth recommend the career to the children who send her their invention ideas? \n\"I think it is a career anyone can do because if you're interested in creating content, and you're creative, it's actually something lots of people can have a go at,\" she says. \n\"If someone wants to be a YouTuber I would also think about your other skills, because some of the most popular channels are channels where people are filming themselves doing something else. So think about your skill.\"\nLee Hinchcliffe, from Barnsley, has been filming content for the platform since he was 15. \nHe began with gaming videos before trying skit videos and then challenge videos.\nHis channel took off when he started playing McDonald's Monopoly. He spent hundreds of pounds at the chain trying to win a \u00a310,000 prize ticket. \n\"I never won it, I lost a lot of money, but people saw that video,\" he says.\n\"I've always had the love of creating videos and entertaining all my life, so that's why I've gone at it since school.\n\"YouTube is my university and I got my degree there, because you can watch back everything I've done.\" \nOff the back of his channel, Lee became a TV presenter with CBBC, starring on screen alongside madcap puppet Hacker T Dog. \nHe said his YouTube experience had made the switch to television much easier. \n\"Instead of doing a screen test and auditions, it was like, 'we've seen your videos, here's your mic, here's your earpiece, off you pop',\" he says.\n\"It's an obsession and it's grown into a career I'm able to do every day. There's no switch off because it's hard to switch off from something you love so much, and it needs constant plate spinning.\"\nSteve Garbutt, 55, runs Yorkshire Car Restoration in Doncaster with his son Shane.\nThe pair have been creating YouTube videos for the past five years and their business has boomed.\nSteve says they had gone from a 1,000ft warehouse to 10,000ft - and from three or four cars to more than 40.\n\"You have to put many hours into YouTube, because you not only have to do the work, you've got to change camera and lighting, and you're doubling your work load. Then you've got to go home and edit all your footage,\" he says.\n\"I've always been a bit of a techy, I like my gadgets and things. My original training when I left school was in computers. And then at 21 I changed careers because I thought there was too many people doing it.\"\nThey began on the platform by offering free car restoration to famous YouTubers such as Mat Armstrong, who has 4.5m followers.\n\"You've got to be very clever, you've got to look where the opportunities are. Rather than money it gives you a lot of opportunities. \n\"Our first opportunities were to restore famous YouTubers' cars free of charge, in exchange we got them advertising for us and sending us people to watch.\"\nThey have also worked with The Stig from Top Gear, Mike Brewer from Wheeler Dealers and Jonny Smith from The Late Brake Show.\nOriginally they hoped the channel would make money but they soon found the support they received more rewarding.\n\"We get so many good comments it makes you want to make another video. Even if the financial reward isn't there, because unless you're someone like Mat Armstrong it's not as profitable as everybody thinks,\" Steve says.\n\"The amount of hours you put in doesn't warrant that kind of money, you should be paid more. But the reward is massive.\n\"I would encourage someone not to just do YouTube, to make sure they get a career and base their YouTube on something they love.\n\"Don't think your niche is going to explode and make you famous.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North",

        "article_text": "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.\nTen of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.\nOnly Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.\nThe exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.\nCommentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.\nWhile plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.\nHere I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.\nSouth America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.\nThe US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.\nFor example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.\nThere is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.\nWith the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.\nThese include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.\nHe tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".\nHowever, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.\nSo his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.\n\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.\nYet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.\nTake the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.\nJapan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.\nOther Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.\nBrazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.\nTrump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.\nThis would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.\nMeanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place. \nThe other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.\nUruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.\nHe said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.\nYou may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.\nWhether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.\nFirstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.\nThe US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.\nBrazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.\nArgentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.\n\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.\nTrump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.\nEduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.\nLooking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.\nAfter all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.\nMr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"\nHe theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.\nSo, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.\nAs Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"\nSubject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.\nBut adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"\n",

        "article_text": "For years, conservationists have been working to bring native trees back to the spectacular Glen Rosa on the Isle of Arran.\nBut a decade of effort was wiped out in days when a wildfire ripped across the valley earlier this month.\n\"It was years of our work going up in flames,\" Kate Sampson, the National Trust for Scotland's senior ranger on Arran, told BBC Scotland News. \n\"We just have to start again.\n\"We've lost 10 years of conservation work and effort but we just have to pick ourselves up.\"\nThe blaze began on Thursday 10 April and was not fully extinguished until the following Sunday.\nBy the time the fire was out it had destroyed 27,000 trees as well as killing hundreds of reptiles.\nMuch of the Glen Rosa valley was left looking like a charred and blackened moonscape, with little sign of the years of work from the National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for the area.\nAccording to the trust, thousands of years ago the glen would have been a native woodland but it was left bare by human intervention such as grazing sheep and deer.\nIt has been trying to restore the woodlands by introducing downy birch, sessile oak, hazel, willow, aspen and alder as well as endangered tree species such as Arran whitebeam.\nThen, two weeks ago, Ms Sampson could do nothing but watch as years of effort were destroyed.\nShe was at the scene within minutes of the blaze starting on grassland at the bottom of the valley. \n\"It was shooting up the hill really fast because of the dry conditions and the wind,\" she told BBC Scotland News. \n\"From then on in, it was disaster management.\"\nAs well as firefighters, local volunteers worked around the clock to try to keep the wildfire under control.\nMs Sampson said: \"The moorland was so tinder-dry and we had so much dead bracken and Molinia grass, so it just spread really fast across the moorland. \n\"There wasn't much we could do to stop it.\"\nIn the days after the fire, Ms Sampson and a group of naturalists surveyed the land to assess the potential impact of the wildlife.\n\"It's quite tough to see, it's not just the trees that are gone, all the wildlife in the glen has been devastated too,\" she said.  \n\"We had a group come and we monitored the glen but instead of monitoring live animals we had to record dead bodies. \n\"We had 72 dead slow worms, 25 dead adders, countless frogs and lizards, all dead as well.\"\nAs we walked through the valley, Ms Sampson discovered a live frog and long worm in among the scorched grass. \nIn the two weeks since the fire, she's only come across a handful of reptiles still alive.\n\"It's hard to know the long-term impacts but the ecology has been totally disrupted and it's going to take a long time for that to recover,\" she said.\nInitial investigations have suggested the fire could have started when dry ground was ignited when sun shone through a discarded glass bottle but the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) has not confirmed a cause.\nThe SFRS had put a wildfire warning in place covering all of Scotland a week before the Glen Rosa blaze.\nRicky Donachie, the SFRS station commander for Arran, told the BBC the blaze was classed as a \"significant wildfire\". \n\"Over the wildfire warning period, which lasted from 3 - 9 April, our control rooms received over 5,000 calls,\" he said. \n\"Over 1,000 of them were for grassland and wildfire callouts, with 19 of them in the significant category. It shows the importance of heeding any warnings.\"\nMr Donachie warned against lighting fires and barbeques in the countryside.\nDespite the devastation to the conservation work in Glen Rosa, Ms Sampson remains positive.\n\"If we can get it restarted then we might be able to make this land more resilient to fire,\" she said. \n\"If we can establish really good woodlands here, it will not only have great benefits for wildlife and biodiversity but the woodland itself can act as a firebreak.\"\nWork to replant trees in the Glen Rosa valley has already begun and a fundraising appeal to help revitalise the area has so far raised \u00a312,000.\nThis weekend, a group of almost 100 volunteers helped plant 6,000 trees.\nBeside the beauty spot of the blue pool at Glen Rosa, a shoot from one of the newly-planted trees stands out on the blackened hillside.\n\"It's an Arran whitebeam plant.\" Ms Sampson says. \n\"It's one of the rarest trees in the world and we only have them here on Arran. This can be our first tree of hope.\"",

        "article_text": "In Armenia tech education starts early.\nIn a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights.\n\"He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

        "article_text": "The scion of a prominent Maryland family who was top of his class at an elite private school before graduating from an Ivy League university, Luigi Mangione seemed to have everything going for him, according to friends.\nThey were left stunned by the 26-year-old's arrest for the murder of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot outside of a hotel in New York City on 4 December. Mr Mangione denies that he murdered the father of two.\nAccording to a law enforcement, Mr Mangione was allegedly motivated by resentment at what he called \"parasitic\" health insurance companies.\nHe had spent time in a surfing community in Hawaii, but left owing to debilitating back pain, say those who remember him. It is unclear, however, to what extent his own health troubles shaped his views of the medical industry.\nMr Mangione is currently being held without bail at a notorious jail in Brooklyn, also holding rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. He is facing federal charges, as well as state charges in New York and Pennsylvania. \nFederal prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty after charging him with multiple crimes, including murder and stalking.\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said the death penalty was necessary because he committed a \"cold-blooded assassination that shocked America\".\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" she continued.\nLawyers for Mr Mangione have called the move a \"political stunt\".\n\"Luigi is caught in a high stakes game of tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors, except the trophy is a young man's life,\" said his lawyers, Karen Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz.\nIn New York, Mr Mangione has been charged with 11 crimes, including murder and terrorism.\nHe also was charged in Pennsylvania with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing a false identification to police.\nHe was arrested five days after the attack, at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and was allegedly in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and cash.\nMr Mangione also had a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America and included passages such as \"frankly, these parasites had it coming\", according to police.\nInvestigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. \nLaw enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.\nMr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area who are known for businesses including country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station according to local media. \nThe suspect's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986.\nShortly after Mr Mangione was charged, his cousin, Republican state lawmaker Nino Mangione, released a statement saying the family was \"shocked and devastated\".\n\"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\", the statement read.\nThomas Maronick, a defence attorney who knows members of the family, told the BBC of his shock at the charges.\n\"You wouldn't think someone of privilege or means from a family that's known for doing so much for the community would do something like this,\" he said. \nMr Mangione attended the private, all-boys Gilman School in Baltimore. He was valedictorian, an accolade usually bestowed on the student with the highest academic achievements. \nSpeaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, one of his classmates said Mr Mangione \"didn't have any enemies\" and was a \"valedictorian for a reason\".\nMr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. \nA friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a \"super normal\" and \"smart person\".\nMr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. \nHe also spent time in a co-living surfing community in Hawaii called Surfbreak. Sarah Nehemiah, who knew him then, told CBS he left due to his back injury, which had worsened from surfing and hiking.\nFriends have told US media he had surgery on his back. The background image on an X account believed to belong to Mr Mangione shows an x-ray of a spine with hardware in it. \nOn a Reddit account that appears to have belonged to him, Mr Mangione reportedly posted about his struggles with chronic back pain and brain fog. \nA former roommate, RJ Martin, told the BBC that while Mr Mangione \"never complained\", his back pain at times \"prohibited him\" from doing \"many normal things\", such as surfing or playing volleyball. \nMr Martin - who eventually lost contact with Mr Mangione - said that he believed his former friend \"would have never conceived of hurting someone else\". \n\"There's no making sense of it,\" he added. \nA person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he read two books about back pain in 2022, one of them called Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry.\nHe also gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski \u2013 also known as the Unabomber manifesto. \nStarting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996.\nIn his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual, but also described him as a political revolutionary.\nMr Mangione's mother reported him missing in November to San Francisco authorities, telling them she had not heard from her son since July. \nAfter police began searching for the shooting suspect in Thompson's murder, the missing person report Mr Mangione's mother filed was flagged to authorities, New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters on Tuesday. \nPolice contacted Mr Mangione's mother, who did not identify her son as the suspect but said \"it might be something that she could see him doing\".

Their win rate is just shy of 62%. There have been 40 draws and only 29 league defeats.\nAcross this period, Wrexham have scored 361 league goals (not including play-offs) at a rate of almost exactly two per game while claiming an average of 2.08 points per game.\nParkinson, 57, also guided Wrexham to the FA Trophy final - they lost to Bromley at Wembley - in his first season and has twice led his side to the fourth round of the FA Cup.\n\"Phil Parkinson, our manager, deserves an\u00a0unbelievable\u00a0amount of credit because there have been other teams that have had more resources than us in the past that have not been able to get to the cusp that we have got to,\" said Ker.\nRob McElhenney (left) and Ryan Reynolds are co-chairmen of Wrexham\nThe 'Welcome to Wrexham' television documentary has been at the heart of the club's rise to global prominence over recent seasons.\nSeason four is set to premiere in May and will detail the club's journey from League One to the Championship, with Wrexham becoming the first side in the top five divisions of English football to secure three successive promotions.\nWhile Wrexham do not earn money directly from the show, its popularity has had a significant impact on improving the club's revenue streams.\n\"It's extraordinary. We often talk about the power of storytelling,\" said Ker.\n\"What we've been able to do with the documentary and the football club\u00a0is tell people in America why football is so significant to us, what it means and what\u00a0the stakes are. \n\"Truly, I'm astonished by the volume of interest. It's because America is fascinated by English football and we are a way in for a lot of people who don't follow it in other ways.\"\nTelling the story of the local community in addition to the fortunes of the club itself, the documentary has won eight Primetime Emmy Awards and two Critics' Choice Television Awards.\n\"We're telling\u00a0that\u00a0story, and we're telling the story of the town,\" added Ker.\n\"The amazing thing about all football clubs is that so much life happens around them, and covering that is what we do.\"\nFrom non-league to brink of Premier League: Wrexham's Hollywood timeline\nWrexham clinch promotion with bumper Charlton win\nReynolds takes selfies with fans before crunch game\n\"Our goal is to grow the team, establish Wrexham AFC as a Premier League club, in front of increased attendances at an improved stadium while making a positive difference to the wider community in Wrexham.\"\nThe club's mission statement spells out the scale of the ambition of co-chairmen McElhenney and Reynolds.\nAnd Wrexham's hierarchy have plenty to ponder as they plan for the club's first season in the second tier since 1981-82.\nTheir squad size will rise from 22 players to 25, while matchday squads will feature nine substitutes as opposed to seven.\nIt could, in theory, pave the way for Paul Mullin's return to the squad following his absence over the previous 13 games. \nWhatever striker Mullin's situation, it is clear there is further work to be done on the squad, as Parkinson will want to bring in more players of a higher calibre to bolster his side's Championship prospects.\nThe inevitable acquisitions will lead to an increased wage bill, with Ker recently suggesting Wrexham would need to quadruple their wage outgoings to be competitive in the Championship. \nWork is also due to commence on improving the iconic Kop Stand at their Stok Cae Ras home, while there are plans to develop a training ground and for expansion of facilities for the academy and women's side.\nIt all requires money - and lots of it. But on the plus side, the club are currently operating with a model most EFL clubs will envy.\nThe \u00a326.7m Wrexham made in revenue during their 2023-24 League Two season puts them just below the top Championship sides - who benefit from parachute payments - in terms of income.\nTV and sponsorship revenue will only increase in the Championship, so there is no doubt Wrexham are well placed at present. \nThe next challenge is always the toughest, and the Championship is a different beast from what Wrexham have face over the past few years.\nBut with such impressive alignment from top to bottom at the club, Wrexham know they are in a strong position to achieve their ultimate goal at some stage - whether it be next season or beyond.",

The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2006.\u00a0\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\u00a0\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" \u2013 the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure \u2013 it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsing\u00f8r \u2013 the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg \u2013\u00a0but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon \u2013 and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer \u2013 as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\u00a0\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer, special tours invite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father \u2013 but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto \u2013 written very early in 1603 \u2013 is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsing\u00f8r.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director of HamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town's Shakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatre Schaub\u00fcne and a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022 Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n\u2022 Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists \u2013 but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry \u2013 starring a young Claes Bang as Rosenkrantz \u2013 and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\u00a0\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\u00a0\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\u00a0\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said that every minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In the midst of \"the car capital of the world\", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.\nHome to the \"Motor City\" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called \"the car capital of the world\". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

He has also acknowledged making false statements and omissions on financial statements submitted to the House Ethics Committee and the FEC.\nThe former lawmaker has been ordered to pay at least $374,000 (\u00a3280,000) in restitution. \nHe has been attempting to raise money on Cameo, a platform where people can purchase personalized videos from celebrities.\nSantos's downfall began after the New York Times in 2022 published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\nFrom there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 11 September terrorist attacks. Shortly after, local and federal officials began to investigate. \nHe was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023, he became the first member of Congress to be expelled in more than 20 years, only the sixth in history. \nA report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.\nSantos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.\nSantos, an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has said that he would not ask the president for a pardon. \n\"If the president thinks I'm worthy of any level of clemency that is bestowed upon him, he can go ahead and do it, but for me to seek a pardon is to deny accountability and responsibility,\" Santos told the New York Times. \nYet he appeared to contradict himself in an episode of his podcast, when his guest, blogger Perez Hilton asked him if he would request a pardon if he were sentenced to years in prison. \n\"You bet your sweet ass I would,\" he told the TV personality.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank. \nElevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.\nBut however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse. \nNot only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"\nComing at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.\nThe tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.\nIt came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.\nBut Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.\nDonald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy. \n\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"\nTrump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.\nLower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.\nTrump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.\nHe objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.\n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.\nTrump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.\nNor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.\nTrump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.\nIt has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.\nThe idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.\nSarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled. \nIf shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.\n\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.\nJoe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.\n\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy. \nHe said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed. \n\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"\nPowell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him. \nBut the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate. \nBy law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.\nThe administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure. \nMark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.\n\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.\nAsked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\"",

Reports suggest that Ukraine could be asked to give up large portions of land seized by Russia, including Crimea.\nThe BBC has not seen the exact details of the latest US plan. \nOn Friday, Reuters news agency reported that it had seen proposals from the US that included American legal acceptance of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas, including all of Luhansk in the east of the country.\nReuters says it has also seen counter-proposals from Europe and Ukraine, which reportedly say the sides will only discuss what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory once a ceasefire has come into effect. \nThe US plan also rules out Ukraine's membership in the Nato military alliance and sees a UK-France led \"coalition of the willing\" providing a security guarantee once a ceasefire is in force without the involvement of the US. \nMeanwhile the Europeans want the US to give \"robust\" guarantees in the form of a cast-iron Nato-style commitment to come to Ukraine's aid if it is attacked.\nThe US reportedly further proposes to take control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - currently occupied by Russia - which would then provide electricity to both Russia and Ukraine. The counter-plan makes no mention of giving Russia power.\nIn an interview with Time magazine this week, Trump once again blamed Kyiv for starting the war, citing its ambitions of joining Nato.\nThe US president also told Time: \"Crimea will stay with Russia.\"\nOn Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Russia and Ukraine to move forward to secure a peace deal. \n\"It needs to happen soon,\" Rubio told NBC. \"We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it's not going to come to fruition.\"\nThe US has recently warned it would walk away from negotiations if progress was not made. \nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory.",

        "article_text": "Stars from the reality television show Love On The Spectrum went on the defensive  after Robert F Kennedy Jr commented that people with autism make limited contributions to society. \nPeople with autism \"will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go on a date\", the US Health and Human Services chief said earlier this month.\nThe remarks drew widespread anger from people with autism who reject the notion of needing to be repaired, but also responses from those pushing for a greater understanding of autism.\n\"Autistic people have the same hopes, dreams and yes, the same awkward dating moments as anyone else,\" Dani Bowman, one of the television show's star's said to US media. \nThe reality TV star on the show, which is about a group of autistic adults' experiences dating, said Kennedy's comments were \"completely false\". \nSince joining the Trump administration, Kennedy, who in the past has promoted debunked theories suggesting autism is linked to vaccines, has made autism a main focus. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThat rise is, at least in part, attributable to increased autism awareness and an expanding definition of the disorder, scientists say. First recognized as a developmental disorder in 1978, autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that symptoms vary by person. Some need little to no support in their daily lives, while others need a great amount. \nEarlier this month, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. He did not give details on the project or funding it. He also said his department would investigate potential causes.\n\"Everything is on the table - our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic,\" Kennedy later told Fox News. \nExperts have warned that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder will not be straightforward, and called the effort misguided and unrealistic.\nThe idea of curing autism is concerning for some.\n\"Wanting to cure autism implies that our way of being is wrong and it isn't,\" Ms Bowman told NewsNation. \"We don't need to be fixed. We need to be supported. But the answer isn't erasing autism, it's building a more inclusive world for all of us.\"\nAnother star of Love on the Spectrum, James B Jones, attacked Kennedy's autism remarks on social media, calling them \"extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive\".\nBut not everyone agrees. \nWhile advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion they avoid \"uncomfortable truths about children like mine\", Emily May, who has a child with autism, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Friday.\n\"I have no interest in defending Mr. Kennedy, whose shaky science and conspiracy theories will do nothing to benefit those with autism and their families,\" Ms May said.  \"And yet, I think his remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation around the condition.\"\nOne of Kennedy's main false claims was that \"autism comes from vaccines\". Although he has denied many times that  he is anti-vaccination and said he and his children are vaccinated, he has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.\nThe theory came from a study by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, but it was later retracted by the Lancet medical journal. Multiple studies since have concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.\nDespite her frustration, Ms May expressed admiration for Kennedy's \"willingness to speak frankly about the painful parts of [her] child's life\".\nAutism Speaks, an advocacy organisation, agreed in part with Ms May. \nThe organisation said it heard from parents who felt Kennedy's comments resonated \"with their lived experience\". \n\"The language we use matters,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement to the BBC. \"It should reflect current science and honor the lived experiences of autistic people, many of whom lead fulfilling lives and make invaluable contributions to their families, workplaces and communities.\"\nDr Manish Arora, founder of LinusBio who has spent more than two decades studying autism, noted that Kennedy's statements can be \"very hurtful for families and autistic individuals\". \nBut he also welcomed more research into the causes of autism and said increased attention is a \"meaningful opportunity\". \nStill, he wishes the debate was \"less polarising\". \n\"Scientists should see the opportunity here, avoid the polarised discourse and see the opportunities here,\" Dr Arora told the BBC. \nJake Tilk, and his brother, Max Tilk, who is on the autism spectrum, largely avoid that political discourse in their social media videos where they share what their day-to-day life looks. \nThey share their lives online to create awareness and acceptance of autism, because the brothers want to celebrate neurodiversity, Jake Tilk told the BBC. \n\"It's most important that discussions about autism are grounded in science, compassion and most importantly the living experiences of people with autism themselves,\" he said.

But their sons were so far away in weight and experience that, on paper, they never should have shared a ring.\nThe smaller Benn had operated most of his career at welterweight, whereas former world-title challenger Eubank was a seasoned pro up at middleweight and super-middleweight.\nSuch was the demand for the match-up, though, a carefully constructed environment was created to make the fight make sense. This is not uncommon in the world of boxing, see Jake Paul v Mike Tyson for further reference.\nA rehydration clause limited Eubank from adding more than 10lb on the morning of fight night.\nBenn was approved to use firmer horsehair gloves instead of foam padding and an 18ft ring was used instead of the standard 20ft - both of which suited his explosive style.\nEubank was a fighter who, at the back end of his career, struggled to make the 11st 6lb weight limit.\nThe clip of him in a sweatsuit - in discomfort and pain - trying to shed whatever fat was left on his body was a sorry sight for the sport.\nBut promoter Hearn feels too much was made of Eubank's weight cut.\n\"He has made it the last five times but he just messed up, that's it,\" Hearn said at the post-fight news conference.\n\"Apart from his dad, no-one ever said 'do you think it's dangerous for Benn to be moving up two divisions and fighting someone the size of Eubank?'\"\nBut regardless of whether you feel Benn or Eubank was at the bigger disadvantage, if so many conditions needed to be met to create a level playing field, should they have been fighting each other in the first place?\nEubank appeared affected by the weight cut during the fight and struggled to keep pace with Benn early on\nBenn, who denies intentional doping and was cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, may never win over the critics - those who feel there are still unanswered questions about the failed tests.\nYet some boxing fans - not necessarily the purists - can be forgiving, especially when you put it all on the line. Judging by the jeers turned into cheers, Benn left north London having converted a few haters into fans.\nHe came close to causing the upset. There is some merit to him saying he could have beaten Eubank had he been more active. Benn has missed out on key learning years and fights over the past two and half years.\nSo where does he go from here?\n\"If it was as close as people are saying it is, then that's what is painful because I wasn't outclassed or hurt in there,\" Ben said.\n\"Do I avenge the loss, or drop down [to welterweight] and win the WBC world title? If [Mario] Barrios is watching, I'd love that.\"\nEubank has gone some way in transforming his public image in the build-up.\nHis emotional vulnerability in opening up about his fractured relationship with his father and the death of his brother in 2021 has softened his 'bad guy' persona.\nEubank has also won over some of his peers, too. He took a hit from his own pocket to compensate those fighters who were supposed to feature on the undercard of his cancelled 2022 fight with Benn.\nIt was a shrewd PR move from Eubank but also highlighted the disparity between main eventers and those who are not earning life-changing money.\nBut for all his good deeds, Eubank had to perform on the night. It was tougher than expected, but he did enough.\nHe has been linked to a bout with Mexican superstar Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in 2026. There will be an easier route to a world title, should he wish.\nWhichever direction Eubank and Benn go in now, we must keep in mind how and why we got here.\nWithout the monocle-wearing, truck-driving Eubank Sr and British Army soldier turned Dark Destroyer Nigel Benn, there would be no 65,000 fans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nWhile Eubank Jr and Benn have carved out their own careers, they are also two fighters reaping the rich fruits of nepotism.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia.\nOutside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins.\nHome to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.\nFor Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.\nRunning the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.\nBurnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.\nStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.\nA once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.\nAs a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\nHealth has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.\nBut experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.\nAustralians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.\nHealthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.\nSeeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.\nThough she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.\n\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"\nWhen Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".\nHealth funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.\nPatients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.\nMedicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.\nFast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.\nThere is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.\nBut the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.\nThat is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.\nAccording to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.\nBut experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.\nBrisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.\n\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"\nAnd every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.\n\"[I] just can't keep up.\"\nThis is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. \nSo his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?\nThis year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.\nThe results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"\nAnd that's just primary care.\nPublic specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.\nThere are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.\nThe BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.\nOthers are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.\nKimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.\n\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.\n\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"\nAnother woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.\n\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.\nThe people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.\n\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.\nAll of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.\nEvery single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.\nStreaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.\nIt's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.\n\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.\n\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"\nShe came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.\nIt's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.\n\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.\nWhen the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.\nIt means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.\n\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.\nLike many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.\nThere's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.\nMany doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.\nHealth economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.\nThe taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.\n\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"\nThe original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.\nShe says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. \nBoth the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.\n\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.\nOn the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.\nHis government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.\nBut the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. \nProposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.\nOne Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.\nLabor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".\nBut many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. \nThere's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.\nExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.\nThat is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.\nAnd the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.\n\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.\nIn Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.\n\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.\n\"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\"",

        "article_text": "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.\nWhen he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.\nAll her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.\nYunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.\nShe was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.\nThe Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.\nBut a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.\nTen of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks. \nOut of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.\nMost of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".\nAbbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not. \nOne has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia. \nBy the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.\nOn the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.\nAt around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.\nThey threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.\nShe was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs. \nShe called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.\n\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"\nKim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.\n\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman. \nThe language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.\nThey found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him. \nBecause she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.\nBut instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.\nThen, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.\nTraumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.\nIt wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.\n\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.\n\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.\nBut while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.\n\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.\n\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.\nBut in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.\nOther details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.\nThe next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.\nPolice arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".\nFrench media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.\nThe question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.\nCourt documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.\nBut how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?\nThe documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.\nMr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".\nHe added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.\nGary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.\n\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".\nThe trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up. \nPolice tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.\nMany jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.\nAs for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable.

They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.\nAround mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness. \nCameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.\nIn his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.\nHowever, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.\n\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.

        "article_text": "Stars from the reality television show Love On The Spectrum went on the defensive  after Robert F Kennedy Jr commented that people with autism make limited contributions to society. \nPeople with autism \"will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go on a date\", the US Health and Human Services chief said earlier this month.\nThe remarks drew widespread anger from people with autism who reject the notion of needing to be repaired, but also responses from those pushing for a greater understanding of autism.\n\"Autistic people have the same hopes, dreams and yes, the same awkward dating moments as anyone else,\" Dani Bowman, one of the television show's star's said to US media. \nThe reality TV star on the show, which is about a group of autistic adults' experiences dating, said Kennedy's comments were \"completely false\". \nSince joining the Trump administration, Kennedy, who in the past has promoted debunked theories suggesting autism is linked to vaccines, has made autism a main focus. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThat rise is, at least in part, attributable to increased autism awareness and an expanding definition of the disorder, scientists say. First recognized as a developmental disorder in 1978, autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that symptoms vary by person. Some need little to no support in their daily lives, while others need a great amount. \nEarlier this month, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. He did not give details on the project or funding it. He also said his department would investigate potential causes.\n\"Everything is on the table - our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic,\" Kennedy later told Fox News. \nExperts have warned that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder will not be straightforward, and called the effort misguided and unrealistic.\nThe idea of curing autism is concerning for some.\n\"Wanting to cure autism implies that our way of being is wrong and it isn't,\" Ms Bowman told NewsNation. \"We don't need to be fixed. We need to be supported. But the answer isn't erasing autism, it's building a more inclusive world for all of us.\"\nAnother star of Love on the Spectrum, James B Jones, attacked Kennedy's autism remarks on social media, calling them \"extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive\".\nBut not everyone agrees. \nWhile advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion they avoid \"uncomfortable truths about children like mine\", Emily May, who has a child with autism, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Friday.\n\"I have no interest in defending Mr. Kennedy, whose shaky science and conspiracy theories will do nothing to benefit those with autism and their families,\" Ms May said.  \"And yet, I think his remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation around the condition.\"\nOne of Kennedy's main false claims was that \"autism comes from vaccines\". Although he has denied many times that  he is anti-vaccination and said he and his children are vaccinated, he has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.\nThe theory came from a study by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, but it was later retracted by the Lancet medical journal. Multiple studies since have concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.\nDespite her frustration, Ms May expressed admiration for Kennedy's \"willingness to speak frankly about the painful parts of [her] child's life\".\nAutism Speaks, an advocacy organisation, agreed in part with Ms May. \nThe organisation said it heard from parents who felt Kennedy's comments resonated \"with their lived experience\". \n\"The language we use matters,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement to the BBC. \"It should reflect current science and honor the lived experiences of autistic people, many of whom lead fulfilling lives and make invaluable contributions to their families, workplaces and communities.\"\nDr Manish Arora, founder of LinusBio who has spent more than two decades studying autism, noted that Kennedy's statements can be \"very hurtful for families and autistic individuals\". \nBut he also welcomed more research into the causes of autism and said increased attention is a \"meaningful opportunity\". \nStill, he wishes the debate was \"less polarising\". \n\"Scientists should see the opportunity here, avoid the polarised discourse and see the opportunities here,\" Dr Arora told the BBC. \nJake Tilk, and his brother, Max Tilk, who is on the autism spectrum, largely avoid that political discourse in their social media videos where they share what their day-to-day life looks. \nThey share their lives online to create awareness and acceptance of autism, because the brothers want to celebrate neurodiversity, Jake Tilk told the BBC. \n\"It's most important that discussions about autism are grounded in science, compassion and most importantly the living experiences of people with autism themselves,\" he said.

The IDF said it struck \"a key Hamas terrorist who posed a significant threat\" to its troops, without identifying him.\nIt added that precise munitions were used and that steps had been taken to mitigate the risk to civilians, while also accusing Hamas of exploiting civilians as human shields.\nThe Civil Defence initially reported that 12 people were killed in the strike, but increased the death toll on Friday after its first responders recovered another 11 bodies overnight.\nAnother 29 people were reportedly killed elsewhere in the territory.\nThey included a family of six - a couple and their four children - whose home in the northern Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City was struck overnight, according to the Civil Defence.\nThe Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) later identified the man who was killed as Ali al-Sarafiti, who it said was a member of the armed group and a former prisoner who was jailed for 13 years in Israel after being convicted over an attempted suicide attack.\nThe IDF said it was not aware of a strike in that area area.\nPalestinian media also said three displaced people were killed when their family tent was hit near Nuseirat, in central Gaza, and that two children died in a strike on another tent in the southern Khan Younis area.\n\"One by one we are getting martyred, dying in pieces,\" Rania al-Jumla, who lost her sister in a strike in Khan Younis, told AFP news agency.\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Thursday morning that at least 1,978 people had been killed since Israel resumed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire.\nIsrael says it is putting military pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.\nIt has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza for seven weeks, which the UN says is \"further depriving people of the means for survival and undermining every aspect of civilian life\".\nThe UN has urged Israel to end the blockade immediately, saying it has obligations under international law as the occupying power to ensure food and medical supplies for the population, as well as ensuring essential services.\nIsrael has insisted it is acting in accordance with international law, and that there is no shortage of aid in Gaza because 25,000 lorries entered during the recent ceasefire.\nDuring a visit to southern Gaza on Thursday, the IDF's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, told troops: \"We continue our operational pressure and to tighten our hold on Hamas as needed, and if we do not see progress in the return of the hostages, we will expand our activities into a more intense and significant operation until we reach a decisive outcome.\"\n\"Hamas is responsible for starting this war, Hamas is still cruelly holding the hostages, and is responsible for the dire situation of the population in Gaza,\" he added.\nThe IDF later ordered residents of two areas just to the north-west of Jabalia to evacuate immediately.\nIt warned that forces were \"operating intensely\" in Beit Hanoun and Sheikh Zayed \"due to ongoing terrorist activities and sniper fire\".\nAbout 420,000 Palestinians - 20% of Gaza's population - are estimated to have been displaced again over the past five weeks, with almost 70% of the territory under active Israeli evacuation orders, within Israeli-designated \"no-go areas\", or both, according to the UN.\nThe IDF has said the evacuation orders are in accordance with the obligation under international law to take feasible precautions to mitigate harm to civilians by providing advance warnings prior to attacks.\nBut the UN has warned that the orders have resulted in the \"forcible transfer\" of civilians into \"ever shrinking spaces where they have little or no access to life-saving services\" and continue to be subject to attacks.\nIn a separate development on Thursday, the IDF acknowledged that Israeli tank fire had killed a Bulgarian working for the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and wounded five other UN staff on 19 March.\nThe IDF had initially denied responsibility for the strike on a UN guesthouse in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah.\nIsrael launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 51,350 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",

The IDF said it struck \"a key Hamas terrorist who posed a significant threat\" to its troops, without identifying him.It added that precise munitions were used and that steps had been taken to mitigate the risk to civilians, while also accusing Hamas of exploiting civilians as human shields.The Civil Defence initially reported that 12 people were killed in the strike, but increased the death toll on Friday after its first responders recovered another 11 bodies overnight.Anti-Hamas protests on rise in Gaza as group's iron grip slipsGaza health ministry denies manipulating death toll figuresAnother 29 people were reportedly killed elsewhere in the territory.They included a family of six - a couple and their four children - whose home in the northern Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City was struck overnight, according to the Civil Defence.The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) later identified the man who was killed as Ali al-Sarafiti, who it said was a member of the armed group and a former prisoner who was jailed for 13 years in Israel after being convicted over an attempted suicide attack.The IDF said it was not aware of a strike in that area area.Palestinian media also said three displaced people were killed when their family tent was hit near Nuseirat, in central Gaza, and that two children died in a strike on another tent in the southern Khan Younis area.\"One by one we are getting martyred, dying in pieces,\" Rania al-Jumla, who lost her sister in a strike in Khan Younis, told AFP news agency.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Thursday morning that at least 1,978 people had been killed since Israel resumed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire.Israel says it is putting military pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.It has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza for seven weeks, which the UN says is \"further depriving people of the means for survival and undermining every aspect of civilian life\".The UN has urged Israel to end the blockade immediately, saying it has obligations under international law as the occupying power to ensure food and medical supplies for the population, as well as ensuring essential services.Israel has insisted it is acting in accordance with international law, and that there is no shortage of aid in Gaza because 25,000 lorries entered during the recent ceasefire.EPACommunity kitchens, like this one in Jabalia, are preparing over one million meals dailyDuring a visit to southern Gaza on Thursday, the IDF's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, told troops: \"We continue our operational pressure and to tighten our hold on Hamas as needed, and if we do not see progress in the return of the hostages, we will expand our activities into a more intense and significant operation until we reach a decisive outcome.\"\"Hamas is responsible for starting this war, Hamas is still cruelly holding the hostages, and is responsible for the dire situation of the population in Gaza,\" he added.The IDF later ordered residents of two areas just to the north-west of Jabalia to evacuate immediately.It warned that forces were \"operating intensely\" in Beit Hanoun and Sheikh Zayed \"due to ongoing terrorist activities and sniper fire\".About 420,000 Palestinians - 20% of Gaza's population - are estimated to have been displaced again over the past five weeks, with almost 70% of the territory under active Israeli evacuation orders, within Israeli-designated \"no-go areas\", or both, according to the UN.The IDF has said the evacuation orders are in accordance with the obligation under international law to take feasible precautions to mitigate harm to civilians by providing advance warnings prior to attacks.But the UN has warned that the orders have resulted in the \"forcible transfer\" of civilians into \"ever shrinking spaces where they have little or no access to life-saving services\" and continue to be subject to attacks.In a separate development on Thursday, the IDF acknowledged that Israeli tank fire had killed a Bulgarian working for the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and wounded five other UN staff on 19 March.The IDF had initially denied responsibility for the strike on a UN guesthouse in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah.Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 51,350 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.Israel-Gaza warIsraelHamas",

        "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes has led Manchester United into the Europa League semi-finals, but they will finish in the bottom half of the Premier League\nAfter an hour of Manchester United's draw at Bournemouth, their travelling support struck up a familiar refrain.\n\"Twenty times, 20 times, Man United. Twenty times, 20 times, I say. Twenty times, 20 times, Man United, playing football the Matt Busby way.\"\nThe song has been a source of both pride and solace since United won the most recent of those championships to ease Sir Alex Ferguson into retirement in 2013.\nOn Sunday, it felt particularly poignant. \nAt the time they sang, those supporters did not know the day would end with Liverpool being crowned champions. But they knew it was coming. That very soon, their fierce rivals would join them on the total that had previously meant they stood alone as the most successful team in English football.\nAnd while Rasmus Hojlund's injury-time equaliser prevented them experiencing yet another defeat in this torturous domestic campaign as they drew 1-1 at the Vitality Stadium, there is no disguising the reality of the situation.\n\"Oh yes, it matters,\" said Adam Bell - a long-time United fan, who started following the club in 1973-74, just as they were about to be relegated.\n\"It was really important for us to get to 20. Now they are joining us and you have to say they have a better chance of getting to 21 and 22 than we have.\"\nHis friend Andrew Harris agreed.\n\"But if you look back,\" he said, \"this kind of thing happens in cycles at Manchester United.\n\"We had the Busby Babes and the 1968 team, then we dropped back in the 1970s and 1980s, then Fergie came. Now we are in the next Ice Age.\"\nAfter David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag tried, it is Ruben Amorim's turn to attempt to prise United out of the deep freeze.\nHis results since replacing Ten Hag in November have been patchy.\nThe draw at Bournemouth means United have collected two points from their past five games. It lifted them a place to 14th but they are still heading for their worst finish since the relegation season over half a century ago. The nadir since then was 13th place in 1989-90, when Liverpool won their 18th league crown.\nWhat Amorim has done is to understand the history around Old Trafford.\nTo his credit, he also refuses to dodge a question.\nLiverpool and their achievements, he said, were not his concern. What he thinks about Manchester United is another matter.\n\"The first thing is to focus on ourselves and not on the other teams,\" he said. \"The next thing is to be really honest.\n\"We are in different levels [to Liverpool] in this moment. But I remember when I start seeing Premier League, was the opposite. So, everything can change.\"\nAmorim said United must not try to think too far ahead.\n\"We have an ultimate goal that is winning the Premier League,\" he said. \"I'm not crazy, I know it's not going to be next year. But we are trying to build something and the small things we did during this year are really important.\n\"We need to improve next year, we know that.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMan Utd deserved late draw at Bournemouth - Amorim\nThere is support for Amorim in the fanbase, even if they don't all feel the salvation that would come from a Europa League triumph this season is realistic.\nIn an ordinary season, a two-legged semi-final with Athletic Bilbao - fourth in La Liga - would be regarded as tricky. Ferguson's team couldn't beat them in a 2011-12 Europa League last-16 tie when Andoni Iraola - now Bournemouth manager - played for them.\nThis season, many fans will have hope rather than expectation.\nVictory in the final in Bilbao - which, of course, offers United's opponents even more incentive - not only provides Champions League riches but is also their only route back into Europe full stop.\n\"I hope the project to rebuild works but it is going to take a few years,\" said Bell. \"Even winning the Europa League is a long shot.\n\"I like Amorim. I am positive about him, but we need patience. It takes time to build a team and make them successful. It took Sir Alex Ferguson a long time.\"\nFerguson was three and three-quarter seasons into his tenure before he delivered the trophy that changed United's history for the better. The parallels with that season and this are impossible to ignore given the respective league positions.\nThere was no social media then, no 24-hour rolling news cycle and endless talk on infinite platforms for opinion to be expressed on the club's dysfunctional results.\n\"Two to three years\" was Bell's assessment on the time Amorim will need.\nHis friend is not so sure.\n\"Ten,\" he said, referring back to his Ice Age comment, \"using the same Glacial calendar.\n\"It is not going to be instant, that's for sure.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

What caught my attention wasn't so much the body language or the greetings - it was the table.\nOn one side sat the combined might of the Russian delegation: President Putin, flanked by his veteran foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, his envoy on foreign investment Kirill Dmitriev, plus an interpreter.\nOn the other side, clearly outnumbered: Witkoff and a translator.\nThis is not traditional diplomacy - but then again, Witkoff is not a traditional diplomat. \nHe is a billionaire New York real estate developer and long-time confidant of Trump - who himself is not a traditional president.\nLike Trump, Witkoff has made a career in doing deals.\nThis is how high-level US-Russian diplomacy is being conducted now in the Trump era.\nIt's how crucial decisions with potential implications for the global order are being debated.\nFollowing this round of talks, Ushakov held a conference call for reporters. He insisted that the negotiations with Witkoff had been \"constructive and very useful\".\n\"May I ask a question?\" I began. \"What are the main sticking points, the obstacles to peace in Ukraine?\"\n\"Thank you,\" Ushakov said. \"We'll end it there.\" Conference call over.\nFrom the various alleged peace proposals that have been leaked to the press, there seem to be plenty of \"sticking points\". There are differences over the territorial concessions Ukraine would be required to make, security guarantees, sanctions relief for Russia and the sequencing - that is, the order in which obligations undertaken be carried out.\nThe day Witkoff flew to Moscow, on the edge of the city, peace was shattered.\nA car bomb killed a senior Russian general.\nYaroslav Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the Russian General Staff. The Kremlin accused Kyiv of assassinating him.\nIf that's true, it's a sign of how Russia's war in Ukraine has come much closer to home.\nThere is no guarantee that talks between Putin and Witkoff will bring peace. And there will be concern in Kyiv and in Europe that they were not at the table.\nWhat is clear is that  Putin and Trump are determined to bring their countries closer - whatever happens with the Ukraine peace process.\nFor Moscow and Washington, now their watchword is co-operation.\nOn Friday, I attended a ceremony at a Moscow military park symbolising this. \nIt marked the moment, 80 years ago, when American and Soviet soldiers met on the Elbe River in the dying days of World War Two. That was a time when Russia and America were allies. \nA military band played as people lined up to lay flowers at a memorial to the Meeting on the Elbe.\nPutin's invasion of Ukraine put the US and Russia on opposite sides, but times are changing again. \nThe White House and the Kremlin are trying to repair relations. Could they secure a peace deal, one that's acceptable to Ukraine?\n\"We are just re-establishing contact,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told me at the ceremony. \n\"We are just trying to find a way out of this terrible crisis which was created by the previous American administration. They ruined many things.\"\nMoscow presents itself as peacekeeper. It blames Kyiv and the \"collective West\" for the fighting.\nAnd yet in February 2022, it was President Putin who ordered Russian troops to invade a sovereign neighbouring country, to force it back into Moscow's orbit.\nSo much has changed, not least the attitude of the White House. \nPresident Biden had promised to support Ukraine \"for as long as we can\".\nEarlier this month, Trump blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war.\n\"You don't start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" Trump said.",
