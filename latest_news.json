But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond. \nAhead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures. \n\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.\n\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"\nGeneral Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance. \nIn an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results. \nTariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.\nThe duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May. \nUnder the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US. \nThat share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.\nThe White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year. \nThe adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.\nIn remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.\n\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.  \nLast week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts. \nA letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".\nFord said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.\nThe car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".\n\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".\nStellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs. \n\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "In the midst of \"the car capital of the world\", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.\nHome to the \"Motor City\" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called \"the car capital of the world\". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Harlequins supporters celebrate their team's only try in a 40-7 defeat by Leicester at Welford Road\nThe referee initially allowing a Leicester try despite a clear knock-on in the build-up. Harlequins wing Cameron Anderson, concussed on the floor, being shown a red card. England team-mates Alex Dombrandt and Ollie Chessum squaring up.\nThere were plenty of flashpoints at Mattioli Woods Welford Road on Saturday.\nYet the dedicated away fans section stubbornly refused to ignite into more than mild frustration.\nOn the fringes, where Richard Buck, sporting a Harlequins' striped blazer, and Phil Ellis, a slightly bewildered Leicester season ticket holder of 16 years, sat side by side, the only thing lobbed between the two were pleasantries and cheery small talk.\n\"I've been a bit ambused by this today,\" Ellis smiled. \"You usually get the odd smattering of away fans but this is a bit more concentrated than normal.\"\n\"They are all good lads though.\"\nPhil Ellis (left) and Richard Buck sat side by side on the edge of a block of Harlequins fans\n'Away ends arrive in rugby' shouted the headlines - including our's -  last month when Premiership Rugby last announced two trial matches with specified areas for visiting supporters.\nIt is a story with couple of caveats though.\nFirstly, they aren't really away ends. At least certainly not the aggro-and-pyro, strict segregation scenario the phrase brings to mind in this country.\nFans are not kept apart. And neither are they forced to sit with their own tribe. The option to mix in with the hosts is still there and taken by many.\nAnd, secondly, away ends haven't just arrived in rugby. Travelling fan groups have been block-booking sections of opposition stands off their own backs for decades.\nQuinssa - Harlequins' supporters association, external - are one of the most proactive.\nThey have concentrated more than a thousand fans together on European jaunts, where ticket offices are more accommodating and the idea of any travelling fans is novel.\nTheir members, given a dedicated area because of Covid restrictions of the time, helped inspire their team's semi-final comeback against Bristol at Ashton Gate in 2021.\nTheir club's trip to Welford Road, which holds more than 25,000, was an obvious pick for the Premiership's trial.\nMarcus Smith takes a selfie with travelling fans after Harlequins' Champions Cup match away to Bordeaux-Begles in 2024\n\"It is a great initiative,\" said Leicester chief executive Andrea Pinchen, playing host.\n\"We want to be innovative, we want to try new things and it adds to the atmosphere with fans of both sides getting louder and louder,\"\nHer Quins counterpart Laurie Dalrymple, who was previously managing director of Premier League football side Wolves, agrees.\n\"It isn't the catch-all that is going to fix all the challenges we have had in our sport over the past few years, but not necessarily about that,\" he said.\n\"It is about giving a slightly different fan experience for the diversifying audience that we need to reach and grow.\"\nAllow X content?\nThis article contains content provided by X.

We don't want to be like football, but we still want an element of that competition. Definitely.\"\nBrandon Wells and Megan Schroeder (centre left and right) and friends Poppy and Cameron were supportive of the 'away ends' initiative\n\"I am all for it,\" added Brandon Wells.\n\"It builds the atmosphere, and you are more inclined to travel if you are sat with people you know and you can sing the same songs.\n\"I am worried our game is going to die. We need to grow the game and this is a step in the right direction.\"\nNick and Joel Baker, attending with their Leicester-supporting partners and sat among the Tigers fans, summed up the split.\n\"I am a bit more old school,\" said Nick. \"I like mixing in together and having a laugh and a bit of fun. There is never any nastiness at rugby, it's not like football where you need the segregation. I am not a great fan of it, to be honest.\"\n\"I think it is good to have the option,\" said Joel. \"If you support a club and now live in a different part of the country, it is nice to sit in with your fellow fans. \n\"I have lived in Leicester for five or six years and it is nice to hear some familiar accents when they come to town.\"\nRachael Pawley, far right, admitted giving Harlequins-supporting Joel, second from right, \"a lot of grief\" as her side emerged victorious\nAs Leicester's lead stretched out in the second half, the volume dipped on the London voices though.\nThe lowing sound of 'C'mon you Quins' and more youthful chanting of star fly-half Marcus Smith's name become less frequent and more quiet.\nOnly 500-odd strong, Harlequins fans were unlikely to break through often, even if the match had been more even.\nBy contrast, Gloucester's fans, congregated in the more sparsely-attended Stonex Stadium for last weekend's first trial match, made their presence felt and voices heard, external with some pithy chants about the deficiencies of London life and Saracens fly-half Fergus Burke.\nWhatever Burke made of it, other players have been supportive of the idea.\nHarlequins flanker Will Evans, who has spoken about the benefits of away support for visiting teams and the league as a whole,, external notably offered up applause to the Quins section.\nLeicester's players also relish focused pockets of support when on the road, according to Pinchen.\nWhether they will see more of it on next season's travels will depend on how Premiership Rugby, who will rebrand the competition for the next campaign, and its clubs' leaders, not all of whom have initially been keen, assess these two experiments.\nJudging by Saturday though, any expansion won't be the radical change to matchday alchemy some traditionalists most feared.\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

        "article_text": "In Armenia tech education starts early.\nIn a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights.\n\"He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

His dad coming on the floor and showing me a towel with his [son's] face on it, [saying] 'This is what we do. We do this.' I feel like that's very, very disrespectful.\"\nHaliburton, who says he was unaware of his father's actions at the time, has apologised to Antetokounmpo.\n\"I had no idea it happened until I got back to the locker room and they showed me the video of my pops,\" said Haliburton.\n\"We had a little talk about it. I don't agree with what transpired there. \n\"Basketball is basketball. Let's keep it on the court. I think he just got excited.\"\nThe Indiana Pacers have never won an NBA Championship \nThe defeat means the Bucks' hopes of a first Championship since 2021 are over.\nThey held a seven-point lead with 40 seconds remaining in game five but the Pacers forced two crucial turnovers in the final 17 seconds. \nHaliburton's winning lay-up was the end of an uninterrupted eight-point run which swung the game in the Pacers' favour. \nThey will face the Cleveland Cavaliers in the semi-finals.\nJayson Tatum is a six-time NBA All-Star\nDefending champions the Boston Celtics sealed a 4-1 series win with a comfortable 120-89 win against the Orlando Magic.\nJayson Tatum top scored with 35 points, as well as 10 assists and eight rebounds.\nThe game turned in the third quarter when Magic forward Paolo Banchero was forced to sit out following his fifth foul, when the Magic held a four-point lead.\n\"It definitely swung the series.

But their sons were so far away in weight and experience that, on paper, they never should have shared a ring.\nThe smaller Benn had operated most of his career at welterweight, whereas former world-title challenger Eubank was a seasoned pro up at middleweight and super-middleweight.\nSuch was the demand for the match-up, though, a carefully constructed environment was created to make the fight make sense. This is not uncommon in the world of boxing, see Jake Paul v Mike Tyson for further reference.\nA rehydration clause limited Eubank from adding more than 10lb on the morning of fight night.\nBenn was approved to use firmer horsehair gloves instead of foam padding and an 18ft ring was used instead of the standard 20ft - both of which suited his explosive style.\nEubank was a fighter who, at the back end of his career, struggled to make the 11st 6lb weight limit.\nThe clip of him in a sweatsuit - in discomfort and pain - trying to shed whatever fat was left on his body was a sorry sight for the sport.\nBut promoter Hearn feels too much was made of Eubank's weight cut.\n\"He has made it the last five times but he just messed up, that's it,\" Hearn said at the post-fight news conference.\n\"Apart from his dad, no-one ever said 'do you think it's dangerous for Benn to be moving up two divisions and fighting someone the size of Eubank?'\"\nBut regardless of whether you feel Benn or Eubank was at the bigger disadvantage, if so many conditions needed to be met to create a level playing field, should they have been fighting each other in the first place?\nEubank appeared affected by the weight cut during the fight and struggled to keep pace with Benn early on\nBenn, who denies intentional doping and was cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, may never win over the critics - those who feel there are still unanswered questions about the failed tests.\nYet some boxing fans - not necessarily the purists - can be forgiving, especially when you put it all on the line. Judging by the jeers turned into cheers, Benn left north London having converted a few haters into fans.\nHe came close to causing the upset. There is some merit to him saying he could have beaten Eubank had he been more active. Benn has missed out on key learning years and fights over the past two and half years.\nSo where does he go from here?\n\"If it was as close as people are saying it is, then that's what is painful because I wasn't outclassed or hurt in there,\" Ben said.\n\"Do I avenge the loss, or drop down [to welterweight] and win the WBC world title? If [Mario] Barrios is watching, I'd love that.\"\nEubank has gone some way in transforming his public image in the build-up.\nHis emotional vulnerability in opening up about his fractured relationship with his father and the death of his brother in 2021 has softened his 'bad guy' persona.\nEubank has also won over some of his peers, too. He took a hit from his own pocket to compensate those fighters who were supposed to feature on the undercard of his cancelled 2022 fight with Benn.\nIt was a shrewd PR move from Eubank but also highlighted the disparity between main eventers and those who are not earning life-changing money.\nBut for all his good deeds, Eubank had to perform on the night. It was tougher than expected, but he did enough.\nHe has been linked to a bout with Mexican superstar Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in 2026. There will be an easier route to a world title, should he wish.\nWhichever direction Eubank and Benn go in now, we must keep in mind how and why we got here.\nWithout the monocle-wearing, truck-driving Eubank Sr and British Army soldier turned Dark Destroyer Nigel Benn, there would be no 65,000 fans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nWhile Eubank Jr and Benn have carved out their own careers, they are also two fighters reaping the rich fruits of nepotism.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Certainly I have longer legs and I always have huge bruises on my body from driving the car just because the seat is poking me in the wrong places.\"\nDespite the discomfort, the chance to step into the JPS Lotus 97T in which his late uncle achieved his first grand prix victory at a rainy Estoril on 21 April 1985 is always a huge thrill for Bruno Senna.\nNot just because Ayrton Senna is unquestionably one of the all-time greats of Formula 1, but also because he sees it as a way of maintaining an emotional connection to his life and racing legacy.\nThe statistics are simple - Ayrton Senna won three Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship titles, 41 grands prix and took pole on 65 occasions.\nHis rivalries with other drivers, primarily France's Alain Prost, but also Nigel Mansell and Michael Schumacher, are among the most epic in the sport's history. \nBut although those world titles were all achieved for McLaren, Bruno believes the 1985 Lotus was something special.\n\"It's probably the most beautiful livery ever in F1,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton. \n\"It's a very iconic, classic livery, the black and gold colour scheme. Everybody who knows anything about motor racing will recognise this car.\n\"When you look at the modern cars, they're so big and so complicated, this is like the polar opposite. They're small, they're simple and it makes you sort of sit on the road with a rocket on your back.\" \nBruno also competed in Formula 1, from 2010 to 2012, and believes modern drivers are \"spoiled\" when it comes to the machinery provided for them.\nHe stepped into the Lotus at the Goodwood 82nd Members' Meeting and described it as a \"real visceral experience\".\nThe 41-year-old said: \"I raced in modern cars my whole life and they are so refined, so simple and easy. When you drive these things it's such a stressful experience because the smallest mistake you make and it's game over.\"\n1985: Ayrton Senna and his Lotus F1 car\nSporting Witness: The fatal crash of Ayrton Senna\nKeeping the Ayrton Senna brand and legacy alive\nAyrton Senna beat Alain Prost and Keke Rosberg at the 1985 Portuguese GP\nOn 1 May, it will be exactly 31 years since Ayrton Senna died in a crash at the Tamburello corner at Imola at the age of only 34.\nHe was given a state funeral and his memory lives on thanks to the work of the Instituto Ayrton Senna, which was founded by his sister.\n\"In all sports people remember the greatest, but Ayrton sort of went above that. He was someone people connected with on the very personal side, rather than just admiring a successful sportsman,\" said Bruno.\n\"I think it's mostly because of what he stood for, what he believed in and how strongly he carried that message.\n\"When you see young kids born decades after Ayrton passed away being so passionate about him, it's because their parents or grandparents carry this on and they identify with this.\"\nHe continued: \"It's amazing that this legacy stays so strong. We are very proud of it because we believe the world needs a lot of Ayrton's values to be a better place, and the 30th anniversary (of his death) last year was a huge celebration of his legacy.\"\nBruno Senna drove in other championships including Formula E, sports cars and endurance racing\nBruno was only 18 months old when his uncle triumphed at Estoril, a victory that always remained special throughout his career.\n\"He'd always been someone who puts so much pressure on himself to deliver and I think this moment allowed him to get into his own groove and then achieve everything he achieved afterwards,\" he said.\n\"When I was three or four years old I remember watching his races but by then he was with McLaren. I didn't watch many of these Lotus races live, I watched them on replays but always the family was rooting for him back home.\n\"He was my hero and I was driving go-karts when I was five years old, so obviously I was trying to follow in his footsteps from a very early age.\"\nBruno was always fascinated to hear his uncle speak about Prost and his other rivals.\n\"In Portuguese you have so many specific expressions that don't mean anything in other languages, but he had so much respect for Alain, even at the height of their rivalry.\n\"It was a lot of fun talking to him about some races where something went wrong or something went right, he understood the challenge he had from his opponents and the whole racing career built him to what he was.\"\nSo how did it feel for him to step behind the wheel of the Lotus 97T at Goodwood, apart from the difficulty of fitting into the driver's seat?\n\"I think the moment you kind of feel emotional about it is when you do the in-lap and you're just cruising around, cooling the car.\n\"Then you can sort of interact with the crowd a little bit and see what their faces are expressing. It means so much to the people.... a lot of them never even saw this car on the race track and having this opportunity really is a special thing.\nHe added: \"We're so happy the classic Team Lotus keep this car in such great shape, but the human element here is as important as the machine.\"\nListen to The Motorsport Show on BBC Radio Northampton at 6pm on Tuesday.",

        "article_text": "The French government has been urged to reconsider rehoming two stranded killer whales in Canada.\nWikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo are currently held at Marineland Antibes, a marine zoo in southern France, where they were born and have been kept their entire lives. It closed in January.\nAn application to send them to the most likely rehoming destination - Loro Parque marine zoo in Tenerife - was blocked by Spanish authorities. Loro Parque is already home to four orcas, including one born last month.\nLori Marino, president of The Whale Sanctuary Project (WSP), said their site in Nova Scotia is \"the only option left\", as French authorities have not yet identified a location in Europe for orcas and rejected a move to a marine zoo in Japan.\nHer group is bidding to rehome the orcas in the east Canadian province despite a previous offer being rejected by the French ministry for ecology earlier this year.\nAnimal rights groups want the orcas to be rehomed in a whale sanctuary where they will have more space to swim and will not be forced to breed or perform in shows.\nAgne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said in February she was looking for a European sanctuary but a suitable site for Wikie and Keijo has not been secured yet.\n\"If you don't even have a site, you're years away from being a viable sanctuary,\" said Lori, adding that the WSP had already carried out environmental studies, water surveys and been offered a lease by Canada's department of natural resources.\nManagers at Marineland said sanctuaries are a hypothetical that \"will take years\" to be built and with \"no guarantees\" the whales will be properly looked after.\nThey stressed that Wikie and Keijo \"must leave now\" for their own welfare, adding: \"Marineland reaffirms the extreme urgency of transferring the animals to an operational destination.\"\nThough Marineland has closed as a marine zoo business, they are still legally responsible for the welfare of the animals until they are rehomed.\nThe application to move them to Loro Parque was described as a temporary measure by Pannier-Runacher that would bridge the gap until a sanctuary in Europe had been found and built.\nBut activists feared the transfer would end up being permanent. The decision by a Spanish scientific panel to block it came as a pleasant surprise to many of them.\n\"I was shocked,\" Lori told BBC News. \"We thought it was a fait accompli. We assumed that was where the orcas were going, it looked like a done deal.\"\nThe scientific panel's approval was needed to complete the transfer but they concluded Loro Parque's facilities did \"not meet the minimum requirements in terms of surface area, volume and depth necessary to house the specimens in optimal conditions\".\nDr Jan Schmidt-Burbach, head of animal welfare and wildlife research at the charity World Animal Protection, said the decision was \"unexpected but rational\".\nHe added that it \"perfectly illustrates the fact that marine parks are an outdated industry with dropping acceptability\" in society.\nLoro Parque responded to the panel's decision by saying their \"facilities are recognised by independent assessors as providing among the highest levels of animal welfare in the world\".\nThe WSP has identified a site in Port Hilford Bay, Nova Scotia that they plan to cordon off using 1,600m of nets.\nThe project's team also contains people who were involved in a whale sanctuary that was created to house Keiko \u2013 the orca who starred in the 1993 movie Free Willy.\nCharles Vinick, CEO of the WSP, managed the Keiko project in Iceland and Jeff Foster, who specialises in moving marine animals, was also part of that team.\nKeiko was born in the wild and was able to relearn some survival skills after arriving at the sanctuary in 1998.\nHe spent four years there before leaving with a pod of orcas he had joined. They swam to Norway where he died in 2003 following an infection.\nThere is no chance Wikie and Keijo will be released into the wild as, unlike Keiko, they were born in captivity.\nThey have spent their whole lives being cared for and entertained by their trainers. Lori says they would be similarly cared for in Nova Scotia but have much more space to live in than a pool.\n\"We have a whole crew who know how to build and run a sanctuary,\" said Lori. \"They have done it before and I think we are the only team who has any experience in doing this.\"\nLori and the WSP team contacted the ministry after learning the transfer to Loro Parque had been blocked. At time of writing, they had not received a response. \nBBC News also contacted the ministry for comment. Pannier-Runacher had not made any new announcements about what will happen to the orcas.\nUntil a decision is made Wikie and Keijo remain in Marineland, unaware the rest of their home is now empty.",

It shows the importance of heeding any warnings.\"\nMr Donachie warned against lighting fires and barbeques in the countryside.\nDespite the devastation to the conservation work in Glen Rosa, Ms Sampson remains positive.\n\"If we can get it restarted then we might be able to make this land more resilient to fire,\" she said. \n\"If we can establish really good woodlands here, it will not only have great benefits for wildlife and biodiversity but the woodland itself can act as a firebreak.\"\nWork to replant trees in the Glen Rosa valley has already begun and a fundraising appeal to help revitalise the area has so far raised \u00a312,000.\nThis weekend, a group of almost 100 volunteers helped plant 6,000 trees.\nBeside the beauty spot of the blue pool at Glen Rosa, a shoot from one of the newly-planted trees stands out on the blackened hillside.\n\"It's an Arran whitebeam plant.\" Ms Sampson says. \n\"It's one of the rarest trees in the world and we only have them here on Arran.

It's likely we'll know how many seats each party has won in the coming hours. \nFederal election officials are required to count ballots by hand in front of witnesses. Ballots are tallied only after polls close in each location where the votes were cast. \nThese projections are based on initial results from Elections Canada, which runs the country's federal elections.\nOfficials double-check vote totals after the election. \nLiberal leader Mark Carney does not need to be sworn in again. Instead, he will continue doing his job, as do his Cabinet ministers.\nShould Carney decide to reshuffle his Cabinet, there will be a ceremony with the governor general, but until then, the ministers stay in their posts. \nCarney may indeed choose to shuffle his Cabinet after bringing in a leaner team when he became prime minister last month.\nWhen Parliament opens after an election, expect the swearing-in of members and the election of the Speaker. \nOne of his priorities is to navigate the relationship with US President Donald Trump.\nWhen the pair spoke in late March, Carney and Trump agreed they would begin  negotiations about a new economic and security relationship right after the election.\nWhen Parliament returns, it's possible we see the Liberals quickly introduce legislation focused on securing Canada's economy in the face of US tariff headwinds.\nThat could include a promised tax cut for middle-class Canadians, and moving ahead with a \"one project, one review\" process to speed up approval for key energy and mining proposals. \nThe Liberals have said they want to make Canada a \"clean and conventional energy\" superpower. \nThey have also committed to putting C$5bn into a trade diversification fund. \nThe Liberals may fall short of the 172 required for a majority in the House of Commons. \nThe most likely scenario if this happens is that they form a minority government with Carney as prime minister, where they strike deals with the other parties to survive no-confidence votes and pass legislation in Parliament.\nThe Conservatives are on track to once again form the Official Opposition. \nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre is on track to make significant inroads with the party's vote share, securing roughly 41% of the vote, according to Election Canada.\nThat would be the highest the party has in decades. \nThey are currently projected to have won 144 seats - that's up from 120 at dissolution, when the election was called.\nBut there are some bitter pills to swallow - Poilievre himself is projected to have lost his seat in Ontario.\nAnd with voters switching from NDP to the Liberals, those expanded Conservative numbers weren't enough to win. \nThis will be a tough loss for them, being in such a strong position only a few months ago when they had a clear path to victory.\nThey will now need to figure out a way forward after a series of electoral defeats.\nAnd it is hard to see Poilievre staying on at the helm, which would mean a fourth leader since the Liberals swept the 2015 election.",

        "article_text": "Declan Rice warned his Arsenal team-mates of PSG's danger in the Champions League semi-final first leg\nDeclan Rice captured the mood and flagged up the danger signals in his final message as Arsenal gathered in a huddle before they faced the formidable challenge of Paris St-Germain.\n\"If we don't have the ball, we die,\" Rice told his Arsenal team-mates as they finished their warm-up before the Champions League semi-final first leg at Emirates Stadium.\nArsenal are not quite dead in the tie, but they are definitely struggling to stay alive  as they trail 1-0 going into the return in Paris - mainly because they were unable to carry out Rice's instructions in the crucial opening phases that shaped the game.\nThe stage was set for Arsenal's first Champions League semi-final in 16 years by an extravagant display of fireworks and pyrotechnics, all against the backdrop of a huge banner covering the giant stands emblazoned with the words 'make it happen'.\nIt was PSG who made it happen - and made it happen exactly in the manner Rice so clearly feared.\nOusmane Dembele's fourth-minute finish across Arsenal keeper David Raya from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's delivery was the culmination of a 26-pass move. It was PSG in microcosm, Rice's warning delivered in the most painful manner.\nTo emphasise PSG's domination in the first exchanges, they had 71.6% possession in the first 26 minutes - the period of the game in which they threw a bucket of ice-cold water over what had been a white-hot environment - to lay the platform for the advantage they will take back to Paris for next Wednesday's second leg.\nIn that same period, PSG had a remarkable passing accuracy of 86.5% in Arsenal's half, and the total ratio was 165 passes to 60.\nIn effect, when Arsenal finally read Rice's memo, the most important damage had been inflicted.\nArsenal pulled it around, having 55.4% possession for the rest of the game, but Rice knew what was coming and PSG were simply too good to stop early on.\nWhat Arteta and Arsenal learned from PSG clash\nWe have to do something special in Paris - Arteta\nHow Arteta, Flick and Luis Enrique are inspired by Guardiola\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said: \"We are disappointed with the result. We put so much into the game. We struggled for the first 10 or 15 minutes to get momentum and dominance but we are disappointed not to get a draw at least.\"\nHe praised the quality that to Dembele's goal, saying: \"That is always the danger. Credit to them. They get out of a situation that is close. We had seven players behind the ball and they were clinical, sometimes you just have to recognise the talent of the individual.\"\nThis was a different PSG to the one that lost 2-0 in tame fashion here in October as the Champions League started its new league table format, and how it showed.\nIn the intervening months, coach Luis Enrique has fashioned a PSG side shot through with quality from back to front, while his personal attention has brought the best from brilliant teenager Desire Doue, while coaxing the best out of the enigmatic Dembele, who flattered to deceive at Barcelona.\nAnd, in what might be the final flourish of the current move away from the so-called 'Bling Bling' era of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar, they added the young Georgia genius Kvaratskhelia to a thrilling attack.\nThe villain of PSG's piece at Emirates Stadium back in October was giant Italian keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who received particularly heavy criticism for allowing Bukayo Saka's free-kick to drift in past him.\nPSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made up for his Emirates nightmare earlier in the competition\nBut since then PSG have cut a swathe through the Premier League elite, as Manchester City were beaten in the table format, Liverpool went out on penalties in the last 16 and Aston Villa followed in the quarter-finals.\nAnd Donnarumma has been a key figure.\nHe made amends for his previous Emirates nightmare here with crucial saves from Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard either side of half-time.\nArsenal will feel those opportunities will offer hope in Paris, but they now have to take the game to PSG with measure as they try to claw back this slim deficit. In those circumstances, however, the French champions may just find that approach to their liking.\nThere was frustration for Arsenal when Mikel Merino's smart header was ruled out after a Video Assistant Referee check early in the second half.\nAs PSG exerted such control in the opening half-hour, winning the ball back with ease as Arsenal reeled, it was easy to see why Rice once again called it right when he expressed such frustration towards his midfield partner and disruptor Thomas Partey for picking up a yellow card in the comfortable second-leg win against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, ruling him out of this meeting.\nRice's same words will no doubt echo in Arsenal's ears at the Parc des Princes - but some things are easier said than done and it may already be too late to save their ambitions of reaching their first Champions League final since they lost to Barcelona in Paris in 2006.\nHope will live on, but PSG have shown what a formidable proposition they have become.

        "summary": "PSG pass masters make Rice and Arsenal's fears come trueImage source, EPAImage caption, Declan Rice warned his Arsenal team-mates of PSG's danger in the Champions League semi-final first legPhil McNultyChief football writer at Emirates StadiumPublished29 April 20251407 CommentsDeclan Rice captured the mood and flagged up the danger signals in his final message as Arsenal gathered in a huddle before they faced the formidable challenge of Paris St-Germain. \"If we don't have the ball, we die,\" Rice told his Arsenal team-mates as they finished their warm-up before the Champions League semi-final first leg at Emirates Stadium.Arsenal are not quite dead in the tie, but they are definitely struggling to stay alive  as they trail 1-0 going into the return in Paris - mainly because they were unable to carry out Rice's instructions in the crucial opening phases that shaped the game.The stage was set for Arsenal's first Champions League semi-final in 16 years by an extravagant display of fireworks and pyrotechnics, all against the backdrop of a huge banner covering the giant stands emblazoned with the words 'make it happen'.It was PSG who made it happen - and made it happen exactly in the manner Rice so clearly feared.Ousmane Dembele's fourth-minute finish across Arsenal keeper David Raya from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's delivery was the culmination of a 26-pass move. It was PSG in microcosm, Rice's warning delivered in the most painful manner.To emphasise PSG's domination in the first exchanges, they had 71.6% possession in the first 26 minutes - the period of the game in which they threw a bucket of ice-cold water over what had been a white-hot environment - to lay the platform for the advantage they will take back to Paris for next Wednesday's second leg.In that same period, PSG had a remarkable passing accuracy of 86.5% in Arsenal's half, and the total ratio was 165 passes to 60.In effect, when Arsenal finally read Rice's memo, the most important damage had been inflicted.Arsenal pulled it around, having 55.4% possession for the rest of the game, but Rice knew what was coming and PSG were simply too good to stop early on.What Arteta and Arsenal learned from PSG clashPublished5 hours agoWe have to do something special in Paris - ArtetaPublished13 hours agoHow Arteta, Flick and Luis Enrique are inspired by GuardiolaPublished1 day agoArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said: \"We are disappointed with the result. In those circumstances, however, the French champions may just find that approach to their liking.There was frustration for Arsenal when Mikel Merino's smart header was ruled out after a Video Assistant Referee check early in the second half.As PSG exerted such control in the opening half-hour, winning the ball back with ease as Arsenal reeled, it was easy to see why Rice once again called it right when he expressed such frustration towards his midfield partner and disruptor Thomas Partey for picking up a yellow card in the comfortable second-leg win against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, ruling him out of this meeting.Rice's same words will no doubt echo in Arsenal's ears at the Parc des Princes - but some things are easier said than done and it may already be too late to save their ambitions of reaching their first Champions League final since they lost to Barcelona in Paris in 2006.Hope will live on, but PSG have shown what a formidable proposition they have become. \"This was a different PSG to the one that lost 2-0 in tame fashion here in October as the Champions League started its new league table format, and how it showed.In the intervening months, coach Luis Enrique has fashioned a PSG side shot through with quality from back to front, while his personal attention has brought the best from brilliant teenager Desire Doue, while coaxing the best out of the enigmatic Dembele, who flattered to deceive at Barcelona.And, in what might be the final flourish of the current move away from the so-called 'Bling Bling' era of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar, they added the young Georgia genius Kvaratskhelia to a thrilling attack.The villain of PSG's piece at Emirates Stadium back in October was giant Italian keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who received particularly heavy criticism for allowing Bukayo Saka's free-kick to drift in past him.Image source, ReutersImage caption, PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made up for his Emirates nightmare earlier in the competitionBut since then PSG have cut a swathe through the Premier League elite, as Manchester City were beaten in the table format, Liverpool went out on penalties in the last 16 and Aston Villa followed in the quarter-finals.And Donnarumma has been a key figure.He made amends for his previous Emirates nightmare here with crucial saves from Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard either side of half-time.Arsenal will feel those opportunities will offer hope in Paris, but they now have to take the game to PSG with measure as they try to claw back this slim deficit.",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, has won Canada's election to become the country's next prime minister.\nHe was sworn into the position last month after his predecessor resigned, but called for a snap election that saw Canadians head to the polls on Monday.\nCarney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.\nUnlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney had never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March, and has now been elected by the people.\nHe had touted his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns. \nCarney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency. \nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April, though he has in the past advocated for similar policies. \n\"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn the campaign trail, he has also advocated for making Canada a \"clean and conventional\" energy superpower, and to speed up major project approvals. \nCarney has called himself a \"pragmatist\" when questioned about potential conflicts between his energy policies and his climate values.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.

        "article_text": "'No-one expected this' - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title\n\"If you had asked Liverpool fans back in August would their team win the Premier League, most would have said no,\" says former Reds goalkeeper Sander Westerveld.\nJurgen Klopp was always going to be the hardest of acts to follow as manager.\nLiverpool supporters were understandably worried about the future when the charismatic German, whose force of personality and success gave him iconic status, announced in January 2024 he was leaving at the end of that season. \nWho would undertake the seemingly impossible task of replacing Klopp? Would Liverpool tread water or even go backwards for a season or two while his successor settled in?\n\"Klopp was a sort of god who changed the club - not just on the pitch but the whole atmosphere,\" says Westerveld.\nFormer Reds midfielder Xabi Alonso, who had taken Bayer Leverkusen to the brink of a first Bundesliga title, was strongly linked with a return before announcing he was staying in Germany. That paved the way for Arne Slot's appointment.\n\"At that moment I didn't even think about Arne,\" says his fellow Dutchman Westerveld, who has remained friends with Slot since their playing days at Sparta Rotterdam in 2007-08.\n\"Nobody in England knew an awful lot about him. Everybody who knows football said it was going to be a huge task and that this was an unknown coach who comes from the Netherlands.\"\nYet the transition from Klopp to Slot has been seamless, culminating in Liverpool winning the title for a record-equalling 20th time.\nWith 25 wins in 34 games and just two defeats, Slot's side have made top spot their own and have looked down on the rest of the Premier League since 2 November. \nAnd now they are champions - with four games to spare - for just the second time since 1989-90.\nSlot, who ruled himself out of the running to become the next Spurs boss while at Feyenoord in May 2023, has joined an elite band of bosses in the Premier League era to have delivered the title in their first season in charge.\nJose Mourinho (2004-05) and Carlo Ancelotti (2009-10) both managed it at Chelsea before Manuel Pellegrini (2013-14) accomplished the feat at Manchester City. The last boss to do so before Slot was Antonio Conte - also at Chelsea - in 2016-17.\n\"Nobody expected this,\" says Ian Doyle - chief Liverpool writer for the Liverpool Echo. \"In terms of an achievement for a manager in his first season at Liverpool, it has to be right up there.\"\nNeil Atkinson, presenter and CEO of Liverpool fans' podcast and website The Anfield Wrap, says: \"I don't think anyone wanted the new manager to come in and try to be a Jurgen Klopp tribute act.\n\"All Liverpool fans wanted was Slot to be himself - and that's what he has been.\"\nLiverpool clinch Premier League title with thumping win over Spurs\nSlot thanks Klopp moments after Liverpool win title\nLiverpool rejoin Man Utd on 'perch' with 20th title\nIn many ways, Slot's main job has been to build on and improve the outstanding squad left behind by his predecessor, who averaged 80.33 points in his last three seasons at Anfield.\nThree more victories would mean Liverpool break the 90-point barrier after Slot tightened the defence and brought more control to the midfield.\n\"They've amassed these points by winning when it's hard, winning when it's ugly, winning when the opposition have put up a fight,\" adds Atkinson.\n\"Liverpool have managed to do that - none of their rivals have.\"\nWhile Federico Chiesa was the only addition to Slot's squad for this season, the Dutch coach has improved players, including Ryan Gravenberch, who has grasped his opportunity at the base of Liverpool's midfield after the club missed out on signing Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad.\nWith 28 Premier League goals and 18 assists in 34 appearances - compared to 18 goals and 10 assists in 32 appearances in Klopp's final season - Mohamed Salah's figures under Slot have been seriously impressive. \nGravenberch's Netherlands team-mate Cody Gakpo has provided 17 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, beating his tally from last season.\n\"In his first meeting with the players, Arne had all the data from the season they were champions in 2019-20 and all the data from the final season under Klopp,\" adds Westerveld.\n\"Last season, compared to the title season, there were less sprints, the team was less effective. Instead of saying to the players, 'come on, work hard', he was telling them exactly what they had to do and needed to know showing them all the data.\"\nThere have been tweaks off the field too, with Slot implementing a new routine for how his players build up to games.\nUnder Klopp, the day would begin later, but this season players have been at the training ground in Kirkby, about six and a half miles from Anfield, at 9.15am for breakfast.\nSlot and his backroom team have introduced a process known as 'body wake-up', which involves breathing exercises before both training and matches.\nUnder Klopp, the Liverpool squad would stay together in a hotel before home games. That is no longer the case, with players allowed to remain at their own homes. \nTraining sessions have been longer than before but less intense to reduce injury risk, with fitness issues undermining several campaigns in recent years.\nIn addition, Slot has made key hires behind the scenes. \nRuben Peeters, a specialist in periodisation (the science of optimising training loads), followed Slot from Feyenoord, Dr Jonathan Power was promoted to director of medicine and performance, while Amit Pannu joined as a new first-team doctor.\n20 of the best photos from Liverpool's momentous day\nLiverpool's tactical tweaks under new boss\nSander Westerveld (pictured, right, at Liverpool's training ground) is a friend and former team-mate of Arne Slot \nLiverpool fans had plenty of time to get used to Slot before his first Premier League game in charge. There were three months between the Reds announcing him as their new head coach and the match at Ipswich on 17 August.\nIt helped that Klopp, after his final match in charge, urged supporters to sing with him 'Arne Slot, na na na na na' to the tune of Opus' Live Is Life before the German waved goodbye to Anfield - a chant that has become more and more popular at the ground as the season has gone on.\n\"Before his first home game in front of 60,000, I asked Arne if he was nervous,\" says Westerveld, who won the FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup at Liverpool in 2000-01 under Gerard Houllier.\n\"He said: 'Oh well, you know, I was manager of Feyenoord and we had a stadium of 50,000 so I'm used to that.'\n\"I said; 'No, Arnie. No... this is Anfield, this is different.' He was downplaying everything. \n\"Then I thought about it afterwards and Liverpool is perfect for him. He's just a normal guy, down to earth, feet on the floor, very calm. For him everything is the same and he doesn't change. \n\"He didn't get carried away when Liverpool won 11 of the first 12 games, and he didn't panic when they lost the League Cup final five days after going out of the Champions League.\"\nOne banner that has become a regular feature in The Kop this season refers to 'Arne's Slot Machine' - a nod towards his popularity with supporters young and old.\nHe has befriended Isaac Kearney - a Liverpool-obsessed seven-year-old, who was born with a rare condition known as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, meaning he develops at a slower rate than other children his age.\nWhen the club heard about Isaac's story, they invited him, his mum Melissa and dad Alan, and older sister Florence to the training ground to meet the players.\nThey were told they might not see Slot as he was busy planning for a game.\n\"Isaac was walking past the manager's office with Mo [Salah] and Virgil [van Dijk] and Isaac being Isaac shouted 'Arne' through the window at him,\" Melissa recalls.\n\"Arne was in a meeting but came out to chat with Isaac. He was so genuine and down to earth. We sat down for lunch and Arne came over and was fist-bumping Isaac.\n\"Arne asked if he was having a nice day and Isaac told him he was still waiting to see Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. Arne said: 'I'm going to take you to meet him right now.'\"\nBefore Liverpool's home game with Southampton in March, Slot also name-checked Isaac in his pre-match news conference.\nAsked how he would cope with serving a touchline ban, the Reds boss said he would be sitting in the stand close to his friend Isaac. \nSlot spent time with Isaac Kearney (right), his mum Melissa, dad Alan and sister Florence after Liverpool invited the family to the training ground\nSlot comes across as likeable, approachable and intelligent in interviews, although there were occasions in his early days when he struggled to grasp the local dialect.\nBefore Liverpool's Champions League game with Bologna in October, a local reporter asked if preparations for a big European game were any different to a domestic match.\n\"That was a bit of Scouse,\" said Slot, struggling to understand the local accent before turning to Tony Barrett - director of first-team communications - for help.\n\"He's relaxed into the job,\" adds Doyle. \"Anyone who has seen his press conferences, he doesn't mind a laugh and a joke. He's mentioned in the past that his dad reads the newspapers.\"\nArend Slot made the headlines in January when Arne revealed his dad was not impressed with the way the Reds performed in the 2-1 Champions League win over Lille.\n\"When I called him after the game he says: 'Ah, it wasn't as exciting as other games of Liverpool,'\" said Arne at the time.\nDoyle adds: \"I haven't seen him snap in press conferences but if he doesn't believe a question is fair he'll make a point of addressing that fact. \n\"He always says 'this season we've basically got what we deserved' whether it's after a win over Real Madrid in the Champions League or defeat by Newcastle in the League Cup final.\"\nWesterveld was at Goodison Park in February when Slot was shown a red card after a dramatic Merseyside derby ended 2-2, with Everton equalising in the 98th minute.\n\"He looked really angry when he walked off the pitch and then he saw me and straight away he smiled,\" he adds.\n\"It's like I said before... he doesn't get too down. He's exactly the same as he was in his first coaching role at Cambuur.\"\nAway from football in the Netherlands, Slot used to relax by playing golf with Westerveld, but since moving to Liverpool he keeps fit playing racquet sport padel with his backroom staff at the training ground.\n\"Go home, eat, take the computer out, watch the training session back, prepare for the next meeting,\" said Slot - whose family have remained in the Netherlands - when asked what he does after training.\n\"He's clearly a brilliant coach... and a serious minded person,\" adds Atkinson. \n\"His reaction to getting knocked out of the Champions League by Paris St-Germain wasn't to bemoan the referee or blame injuries.\n\"He said it was the best game he had ever coached in. He has shown genuine humility while simultaneously having a real sense of confidence in himself, his coaching staff and players.\"\nLiverpool fans have taken Slot to their hearts\nNot since they were champions in the early 1980s have Liverpool won back-to-back league titles.\nSo will they build on this season's incredible success?\nWhile there has been no need for a rebuild in 2024-25, Slot is expected to be active in the transfer market to ensure Liverpool are in a strong position next season.\nAlthough Salah has signed a new two-year contract and captain Virgil van Dijk has also committed his future, England international Alexander-Arnold is expected to move to Real Madrid.\nReported Liverpool targets include Newcastle's Sweden forward Alexander Isak and Bournemouth's Hungary left-back Milos Kerkez.\n\"I refuse to believe Slot will allow standards to slip next season,\" adds Atkinson. \"I think they'll break 80 points again - and if you do that you have every chance of being in the conversation for the title.\"\nWesterveld will be at Anfield on 25 May, when Liverpool host Crystal Palace on the final day of the season, to see his friend and former team-mate show off the Premier League trophy.\n\"To come from coaching in the Netherlands to the Premier League... I didn't expect it to be so easy for him to adapt,\" he admits.\n\"At the start of the season I used to send him a message to congratulate him after a win. Then I sent him a message saying, 'I'm not going to congratulate anymore because it's getting boring'.\"\nThis video can not be played\nI want to keep Liverpool at the top - Slot\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nRobert Sanchez (Chelsea): He's been pretty poor all season and the general consensus is that Chelsea are going to have to change their goalkeeper, but he was very good against Everton. He made three or four decent saves and then was in a position where he could command his box much better than he has done for most of the season.\nKieran Trippier (Newcastle): He was excellent, assured, calm and quality on the ball. At the ripe old age of 34, he is still showing that it's necessary to have experience in the side. He helped Newcastle to manage the game when they went 2-0 up. He showed quality for two of the goals - standing a cross up for Dan Burn and also his corner for Newcastle's third was magnificent.\nCarlos Baleba (Brighton): Brighton will do well to keep hold of Baleba. There are so many levels to go up in his armoury - he is just frightening. He's tall and powerful and his celebration after his last-minute winner wasn't too bad either.\nDan Burn (Newcastle): Burn is the magic man of Newcastle, he just keeps on going. Every time you think his story is doing to drop off, he just keeps getting better. Burn had a real ding-dong with Liam Delap but had the Ipswich forward in his back pocket and then also scored a goal.\nRayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves): It looks to me like he is playing for a move, he looks focused and has the right mindset. His assist for the goal was fantastic but he just continually gets up and down the field. There are only a couple of games left and he still has that burning desire to have an impact.\nAlexis Mac Allister (Liverpool): He has been Liverpool's most consistent midfielder this season. It was a great finish from him, he just looked so calm. The best bit wasn't the goal but it was that he was the standard-setter throughout.\nYasin Ayari (Brighton): He was good and solid but it's all about his goal. What a hit and what a show of technical ability to use Lucas Paqueta who was running at him and just bend it round him.\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves): I'm running out of ways to praise him. He is just at home at Wolves - we know he is leaving but he just looks so comfortable in that side. Wolves know the offer is coming and he just wants to sign off on a positive. He is known as a bit of a maverick and has a wild side but at the moment he has his head screwed on.\nMohamed Salah (Liverpool): He just continues to score goals and had a very decent celebration - a selfie in front the Kop. It's at a time when you think he isn't playing at his full potential too and on a weekend when Liverpool secure the title.\nAntoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): I'm so impressesed every time I watch him. I played against him at Bristol City and didn't think he would be able to go on and do what he's doing in the Premier League, but he is going from strength to strength. Manchester United need to be looking at him - he is powerful and drives, that's what they need.\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle): He could have scored four on the day. His movement and link-up play is excellent. This guy is the complete striker in world football.\nArne Slot (Liverpool): Could it be anyone else on the weekend that he delivers Liverpool a 20th league title? He has come in and only bought Federico Chiesa and turned Liverpool into a title winning team. He's excellent as a manager, excellent in every interview and handles any adversity in the right kind of way.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

        "article_text": "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.\nBut that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.\nMr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".\nHe began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"\nBut in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.\nInternet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.\nEventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.\nAs Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.\nPlatforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.\nThe payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"\nPlatforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.\nSo, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.\nBut while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.\nMr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"\nYet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.\nMr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.\n\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".\nDr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.\nAnd it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.\nBut modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.\nHe says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".\nMr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"\nBut these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"\nBut the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.\n\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"\nDr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".\nIn the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"\nThat is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime.

Many residents had called one another to check on their loved ones.\n\"I don't think my phone has buzzed that much in my entire life,\" he said. \"There was a lot of panic and, you know, relief, when somebody answers.\" \nAt the scene on Sunday, people laid flowers and paid their respects.\nOne woman, named Donna, was at the festival and said it was packed with young people and families.\n\"People were here to celebrate and have fun,\" she told the BBC. \"This is tragic.\"\nThe attack came just before Canada's federal election on 28 April. It prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to cancel large gatherings of Liberal Party supporters in Calgary and Richmond. \nIn a televised address to Canadians, Mr Carney said he was \"heartbroken\" and \"devastated\" by the attack. \nHe visited the scene of the attack on Sunday evening, where he lit a candle and stood in silence with dozens of members of the local community.\nMr Carney also met family members of the victims and laid flowers during a church service vigil.\nThe main opposition candidate, Pierre Poilievre, continued campaigning, but made an unscheduled stop at a church in Mississauga - a suburb of Toronto - to meet with members of the Filipino community.\nAppearing alongside his wife Anaida Poilievre, the Conservative leader expressed his condolences. \"I wanted to be here with you in solidarity,\" he told the church attendees.\nMeanwhile, the leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party David Eby, said he was \"shocked and heartbroken\". \nOne Canadian political leader, the New Democrats' Jagmeet Singh, was among those who attended the Lapu Lapu festival on Saturday, and subsequently changed his planned events on Sunday. \nHe said it was \"heart-breaking\" to see that \"such joy can be torn apart so violently.\n\"I saw families gathered together, I saw children dancing, I saw pride in culture, in history and community,\" he added.

        "article_text": "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia.\nOutside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins.\nHome to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.\nFor Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.\nRunning the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.\nBurnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.\nStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.\nA once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.\nAs a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\nHealth has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.\nBut experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.\nAustralians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.\nHealthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.\nSeeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.\nThough she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.\n\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"\nWhen Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".\nHealth funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.\nPatients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.\nMedicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.\nFast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.\nThere is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.\nBut the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.\nThat is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.\nAccording to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.\nBut experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.\nBrisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.\n\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"\nAnd every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.\n\"[I] just can't keep up.\"\nThis is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. \nSo his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?\nThis year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.\nThe results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"\nAnd that's just primary care.\nPublic specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.\nThere are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.\nThe BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.\nOthers are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.\nKimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.\n\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.\n\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"\nAnother woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.\n\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.\nThe people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.\n\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.\nAll of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.\nEvery single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.\nStreaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.\nIt's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.\n\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.\n\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"\nShe came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.\nIt's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.\n\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.\nWhen the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.\nIt means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.\n\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.\nLike many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.\nThere's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.\nMany doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.\nHealth economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.\nThe taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.\n\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"\nThe original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.\nShe says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. \nBoth the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.\n\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.\nOn the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.\nHis government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.\nBut the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. \nProposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.\nOne Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.\nLabor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".\nBut many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. \nThere's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.\nExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.\nThat is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.\nAnd the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.\n\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.\nIn Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.\n\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.\n\"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\"",

But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Sir Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is \"doomed to fail\".\nIn a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal\".\nHe does not call for Labour to halt its push to decarbonise the UK economy - but says all governments need to rethink their approach, as it is not working.\nThe Tories - who have joined Reform UK in opposing net zero emissions by 2050 - urged Labour to end the \"mad dash\" to this goal - but Downing Street said it would not be changing course.\nIn its report The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions such as COP and the UN have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change.\nAt the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.\nWriting in the foreword, Sir Tony says: \"Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.\"\nHe says \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail\".\nHe also warns against the \"alarmist\" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is \"riven with irrationality\".\nThe report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.\nIt also argues for a greater focus on climate change adaptation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it \"is a paper that is about increased climate ambition\".\nLindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  \"We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.\"\nMs Fursman said the report was \"pointing out that while many economies are doing well, we need to do more, particularly in the global picture because global emissions continue to rise\".\nDowning Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.\n\"We will reach net zero in a way that treads lightly on people's lives, not telling them how to live or behave,\" said the prime minister's official spokesman.\n\"Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands, create good jobs for the future and lower bills in the long term.\"\nThe government claims its net zero strategy is already delivering results, with \u00a343bn of private investment since last July and that its climate policies \"now support around 600,000 jobs across the UK\".\nLabour sources are also pushing back against claims Sir Keir Starmer is going cold on the net zero agenda, pointing to a speech he made last week in which he said the clean energy mission was \"in the DNA of my government\".\nReacting in the Commons to Sir Tony's comments in the report, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he agreed \"with a lot of what it says\" particularly on carbon capture and storage and AI \"which the government are doing\".\nBut Labour's opponents were quick to seize on the former prime minister's words.\nWriting on social media, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Even Tony Blair now says the push for Net Zero has become 'irrational' and 'hysterical'. We are winning the argument!\"\nConservative acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie said the government needed to \"urgently  change course\".\n\"It seems even Tony Blair has come to the realisation that Keir Starmer and the Labour Party's mad dash to net zero by 2050 is simply not feasible, or sustainable,\" he added.\nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: \"Blair is wrong, both morally and pragmatically. The British public understands the need for decisive climate action and expects politicians to lead in delivering this action.\"\nSir Tony's intervention has also been met with dismay by Labour-supporting environmental groups. \nOne campaigner told the BBC: \"This is an oddly public and oddly-timed intervention that would usually be made by someone struggling for access. \n\"The Labour government are getting on with many of the policies outlined in the report because they know this is popular with people, especially the voting coalition they need to maintain for the next election. \n\"But adopting the anti-net-zero framing of [Tory leader Kemi] Badenoch and Reform is out of step with where the public are on this issue and will not help Labour.\"\nA Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: \"There is no doubt that the last Conservative government set us back by failing to invest in cheap, clean energy and home insulation. \n\"But that makes it all the more important that we act with urgency now, to bring down energy bills and emissions, free ourselves from reliance on Putin's gas, and restore the UK's role as a world-leader in the clean technology of the future and the jobs that go with it.\"\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nJose Mourinho v Pep Guardiola: How Jose became 'The Dark Lord'\nWhen Inter Milan drew Barcelona in the semi-finals of the 2009-10 Champions League, few backed the Italian side to progress against Pep Guardiola's world-beaters.\nBoth were chasing their own piece of history. Barcelona were trying to become the first team to claim back-to-back titles in the Champions League era while Inter were seeking a first European Cup final since 1972 and a first win in the competition since 1965.\nIt was a tie tinged with bitterness, with Inter boss Jose Mourinho going up against Guardiola, who had worked together at Barca but were now intense rivals.\nIt was a tie that defined Mourinho as a coach and ultimately saw him lead Inter to the Treble - the first Italian side to achieve such a feat - as they wrapped up the Serie A title, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League.\nAnd on 28 April 2010, he and Inter took a mighty leap towards that historic achievement.\nFifteen years on from the captivating second leg in Barcelona and with the two preparing to face each other in another Champions League semi-final, BBC Sport takes a look at the story of that fascinating tie.\nTension had been brewing long before the players set foot on the pitch.\nIn the summer of 2008, Barcelona were looking for a new manager, having sacked 2006 Champions League winner Frank Rijkaard.\nThe choice was Mourinho or Guardiola, who had worked closely with the Portuguese during the 1990s when he was Sir Bobby Robson's assistant and the Spain midfielder was Barca's captain.\nIt was a position Mourinho had acquired having first started out as an interpreter for Robson at Sporting, before evolving into an assistant coach. He followed Robson to Porto then Barca.\nBut while in Catalonia, the Portuguese was disgruntled with his treatment. \nHe was nicknamed 'the translator' and felt he was not taken seriously.\nWhen it came to Barca appointing a new coach a decade later, Mourinho - who by then boasted Champions League and Premier League titles on his CV - was shunned in favour of Guardiola, who had just finished his first year in management with Barca's reserves.\nIt was a decision that did not sit well with Mourinho and had a profound impact on the way he would go on to set up his teams, sacrificing pretty football - like Guardiola's tiki-taka - in favour of efficiency a solid defence.\nBarca's decision instigated a managerial rivalry between Mourinho and Guardiola that came to a head in 2010 in the tie and was later ramped up while the former was at Real Madrid.\nHow to Win the Champions League\nJose Mourinho\nMourinho's 'the translator' nickname returned in mocking tribute in the build-up to the first leg at San Siro.\nThe feeling was that Mourinho did not stand a chance against a Guardiola team at the height of its power, having won the Treble the previous season.\nAlready rife with drama and a gripping narrative, the first leg was played under a cloud of ash following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull. \nIt meant Barca could not fly to Italy and instead had to take a 10-hour bus journey.\nWhether that had any bearing on the match is impossible to know. But it certainly gave an already intriguing tie an air of theatre.\n\"When you get to the knockouts against a team like Barcelona, you have to win your match at home,\" said Mourinho in a new BBC Sport documentary - How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho.\nThat is of course easier said than done with Guardiola's illustrious squad including Lionel Messi, Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who Barca had acquired from Inter in a swap deal that season with striker Samuel Eto'o.\n\"Before the first leg, Mourinho told me 'you're going to play left-back and you will mark Messi',\" recalls former Inter defender Javier Zanetti in the documentary.\n\"I knew Messi from the Argentina team and he was the best player in the world. I followed Messi around and in every zone he went into, two of my team-mates came to pressure him to deny him space to make a difference.\"\nMourinho's tactics worked and Inter bounced back from an early Pedro goal as Wesley Sneijder levelled before the break then Maicon and Diego Milito assured a 3-1 victory at a rocking San Siro.\n\"It could have been more. A fantastic performance,\" said Mourinho.\nListen: How to Win the Champions League - Jose Mourinho\nHow rejection fuelled Mourinho's second Champions League triumph\nBarcelona fans unveiled a banner which read 'comeback' in Catalan at the semi-final second leg at the Nou Camp\nSo to the second leg.\nWith a two-goal advantage to protect, Inter needed to produce a defensive masterclass to prevent Guardiola's men, backed by their expectant supporters, overturning the deficit.\nThe players emerged from the Nou Camp tunnel to be greeted by a banner printed simply with the word 'remuntada' - comeback in Catalan.\n\"I think that put the pressure on them [Barcelona] because everyone believed they could do it,\" said Zanetti.\nMourinho's style of play is synonymous with a solid defence, and it was something he relied on that night in Spain. That and a number of top, experienced players.\n\"At Inter, my bench was full of top players at the end of their careers. [Ivan] Cordoba, [Francesco] Toldo, [Marco] Materazzi, [Dejan] Stankovic. They were not my first choices, but they were my big allies,\" Mourinho said.\nHe recalled a speech made before the match by defender Cordoba in the dressing room.\n\"He was saying 'this is my dream, this is my last opportunity. I am not playing because of him [Mourinho]. He decided to put me on the bench and decided to play you. So you are going to play for me',\" Mourinho said.\n\"When you have this kind of person on the bench and in the dressing room, your work becomes much more easy. I knew that they would do anything for me and I would have done anything for them.\"\nInter's task became much harder in the 28th minute when midfielder Thiago Motta was sent off for catching Busquets in the face as he raised a hand when defending the ball.\nBusquets rolled around on the ground with his hands clutching his face, stopping momentarily to move his hands in a 'peekaboo' gesture to ensure the referee had produced a red card.\nThe Brazilian's reaction following the dismissal, man-handling Busquets in protest, only fanned the flames of a high-octane encounter.\n\"We went there with a strategy to try to control, to try and bite in counter-attack,\" said Mourinho.\n\"After 20 minutes or so Motta is sent off. People are sometimes afraid to speak about it, I am never afraid to speak about it - the referee's decisions are always crucial.\"\nDown to 10 men and with a 90,000-strong crowd willing their opponents on, Inter sat deep and flooded their defensive areas while the hosts' passing game was typically brilliant but failed to find the gaps.\n\"During half-time he [Mourinho] was still convinced we would reach the final. His confidence was contagious,\" said Zanetti.\nAnd, having already dubbed himself The Special One, Mourinho felt confident he had his tactics spot on.\n\"To play with 10 players against Barcelona, it becomes epic. You need heroes. You need to have the best out of everybody,\" said Mourinho.\n\"I think I was brilliant in the way I organised the team. We defended with everything we had. We defended with hearts, with souls. We gave absolutely everything.\"\nMourinho guided Inter to a first European title in 45 years\nHigh-pressure tactics and gamesmanship continually frustrated Barcelona as almost the entire second half was played in Inter's defensive third. But Guardiola's team of superstars probed without success.\nThat was until, with six minutes of normal time remaining, Barcelona broke the Italians' backline for virtually the first time as Gerard Pique collected Xavi's pass, turned inside Cordoba's challenge and slid home.\nBarca's tails were up and so was the crowd. One more and they would level the tie and progress to the final thanks to their away goal in Milan.\nBojan Krkic thought he had secured victory after he broke free in the Inter box and lashed into the roof of the net in injury time.\nBut the Nou Camp's joy was short-lived as the referee gave handball against Yaya Toure in the build-up and the match finished 1-0, with Inter progressing to the final to face Bayern Munich.\nThe full-time whistle had barely sounded before Mourinho sprinted onto the pitch, one arm in the air, to celebrate with his players.\nBarcelona chose that moment to put the sprinklers on.\nAn attempt to annoy the Inter players and stop them from celebrating on the pitch? Perhaps. For Inter, it did not matter.\n\"It was the most beautiful defeat of my career,\" said Mourinho.\n\"The fact that we played with 10 men for so long, makes it absolutely incredible. If I could choose one of my most emotional performances, in a career of more than 20 years, I would choose that one.\"\nInter continued to celebrate after the sprinklers were turned on at Camp Nou\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

One more and they would level the tie and progress to the final thanks to their away goal in Milan.Bojan Krkic thought he had secured victory after he broke free in the Inter box and lashed into the roof of the net in injury time.But the Nou Camp's joy was short-lived as the referee gave handball against Yaya Toure in the build-up and the match finished 1-0, with Inter progressing to the final to face Bayern Munich.The full-time whistle had barely sounded before Mourinho sprinted onto the pitch, one arm in the air, to celebrate with his players.Barcelona chose that moment to put the sprinklers on.An attempt to annoy the Inter players and stop them from celebrating on the pitch?",

        "article_text": "A young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.\nIn a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.\nOften sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.\nTaking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.\nDespite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".\nThe medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.\nHer estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.\nIn the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing.'\"\nThe few posts he has made are accompanied by hashtags such as #divorcetrauma - saying the accusations are lies.\nNonetheless, the comments section on Dr Ndaba's TikTok and other social media platforms have transformed into support groups, filled with female breadwinners sharing eerily similar stories.\n\"You are brave to speak out so publicly\u2026 I have been suffering in silence,\" one person commented.\nBertus Preller, a lawyer based in Cape Town, believes this is because although South African women are becoming doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, getting well-paid jobs does not necessarily free them from the clutches of the patriarchy.\nWomen's financial independence clashes with \"cultural norms that prioritise male authority\", he says.\nIf anything, their success appears to make them targets.\nFinancial abuse occurs when one partner dominates or exploits the other's financial resources, the lawyer explains.\n\"It is a subtle yet potent tactic of domestic violence, aimed at keeping the victim under control,\" he says.\nIn South Africa, this is legally classified as economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.\nMr Preller says things like \"unjustly withholding money for essentials or interfering with shared assets,\" are covered by the act.\nA university lecturer, who requested anonymity, told the BBC how her husband had lied about his qualifications and eventually left her in financial ruin.\nIt started with her car that he mostly drove but never refuelled. Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.\nDespite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive.\n\"He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall,\" she said.\nEven when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute.\n\"He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone,\" she said.\nLegal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots.\n\"For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance,\" she told the BBC.\n\"For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing.\"\nResearch from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.\nOut of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married.\n\"For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence\u2026 All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider,\" said researcher Bianca Parry.\nMs Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: \"This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally.\n\"This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics.\"\nNombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited.\n\"Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.\nShe explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.\nSince Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.\nFor Ms Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.\n\"You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind. When your person struggles, you struggle too - you want to fix it,\" she said.\nBy the time the university lecturer divorced her husband, she was left with debts of 140,000 rand ($7,500; \u00a35,600) - all racked up in her name.\n\"Before, I could plan things like holidays. Now they are a luxury,\" she said.\nDr Ndaba has been at pains to tell her followers, as she did on one vlog: \"Finance is an important aspect of people's marriages.\"\nThe lecturer could not agree more, urging young women to take their time when getting to know their partners and have open, honest conversations.\n\"Talk about the finances, talk about your background, talk about emotions and character.\"\nMs Gogoba urged more people to protect themselves from their partner, telling them to keep a separate bank account, keep their pins secure and monitor their credit cards.\nThey all agreed that women should understand that love should not come with an unsustainable price tag.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Over the past week I have crossed a radically changing North America, from Arizona to Washington DC in the US and then on to Saskatchewan in Canada, witnessing clear evidence of the consequences of historic change in the way the world economy is run. Huge uncertainty means nobody really knows where it is headed.\nThe walk from the White House Rose Garden to the HQ of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes just 9 minutes. In the past few days, in this very short stroll, two very different worlds collided with each other.\nThe former is the place where at the start of this month, with an extraordinary chart and questionable equation, President Trump took on the world with his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\".\nThe latter is the place where just three weeks on from that, after rowback, market tumult, and confusion, the finance ministers of the entire world gathered to try to pick up the pieces, even as they were still rebounding off the ground.\nAt the IMF meetings that included gatherings of G7 and G20 members, something unique happened. The US representatives faced not open hostility, but exasperation, bewilderment and deep concern, from almost the entire rest of the world, for having sent the global economy back towards a crisis, just as it had finally emerged from four years of pandemic, war and energy shocks.\nThe concern was most acutely expressed by the East Asian countries, who had in early April been classed as \"looters and pillagers\" of American jobs because of the fact that these economies, many of them key allies of the US, export more goods to the US than the other way around.\nThe talk of the G7 was the quiet determined fury of the Japanese, who were said to feel betrayed by the US turn on trade, and whose confusion over what US trade negotiators actually wanted recently sparked a sell off of US government bonds. The finance minister Katsunobu Kato told the roundtable the US tariffs were \"highly disappointing\", hurting growth and destabilising markets.\nI was reminded of the time at the IMF in 2022 when developing country finance ministers asked me if everything was OK in Britain during the mini budget crisis of Liz Truss' government. Then the UK was the source of fragility, trading like an emerging market, when its normal role was solving crises in those markets.\nIn the face of febrile bond markets, this week the faint sound of the bugle of retreat on the US trade war got louder. A forest of olive branches seemed to be on offer from the US to get the Chinese to come back to the table to negotiate, from respect for their economic achievements to the offer of a deal to do a \"beautiful rebalancing\" of the world economy. It was a far cry from the claims of \"looting and pillaging\".\nYet a much hoped for meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart did not materialise.\nMost of the rest of the world leaving their meetings with Bessent are reporting back an assumption that the US is edging away from what it cannot acknowledge was overreach.\nAnd there is a widespread view that there is no need for countries to retaliate, when the CEOs of Walmart and Target are telling the President privately that there will be empty shelves from early May.\nThe collapse in container traffic from China to the port of Los Angeles - the main artery of the world economy for the first quarter of the 21st century - is the one to watch. The IMF's boffins say they can start to see the impact from space as satellites track fewer, increasingly empty ships leaving China's ports. Of course this will be denied by the US.\nIt is true that there was far more relative calm at the end of the IMF Meetings compared to the beginning. Why? Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world.\nFinancial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics.\nThe story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office.\nWall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President.\nAt best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and  currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs.\nAnd that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next.\nAt times of acute global financial stress, \"swap lines\" between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars.\nBut now some of the world's central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar \"swap lines\" to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon.\nIs it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible.\nA little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers.\nIn this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a \"whodunnit\" about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal.\nSome speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible.\nWhile Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that \"Investors need to know that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world\". If you have to say it\u2026\nAnother significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that \"no one was crawling to the Americans\" given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market.\nAmid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the \"baseline\" universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump's message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to \"completely eliminate\" income taxes for \"many people\" would rather suggest that it will stay.\n\"It depends on who you talk to on which day of week\u2026 I've heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,\" said one senior G7 official. \"Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,\" I was told.\nThis is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House's own creative definition of \"trade cheating\" - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly \"cheating\" the UK.\nI put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion.\nBut eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe.\nThat's because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a \"high ambition high alignment\" deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers.\nA very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and \"doing its homework\" as a response to US unreliability. \"Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,\" I was told privately.\nThere was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me. \nBessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win.\nBut a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain's booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year -  and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a \"frank\" discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo.\nHe appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: \"There's a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities\".\nSpain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn't like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month's tariff accusations and chaos.\nWhoever wins in Canada's election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump's 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own.\nThere is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Within hours of taking his second oath of office, Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders and declarations, and fired the starting gun on what has been a rapid and radical programme of change in his first 100 days.\nSo far, he has shown no sign of taking his foot off the pedal.\nThe sheer quantity of his news-generating actions over the past few months could be seen as a carefully considered strategy. It is one that Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcast host who advised Trump during his first term, first floated as long ago as 2018.\n\"The Democrats don't matter,\" Bannon told the writer Michael Lewis at the time. \"The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone.\"\nSo seven years on, with Trump back in the Oval Office and the zone not just flooded but virtually submerged, does Bannon think the strategy has worked?\n\"Flooding the Zone' is an overwhelming success,\" he tells me via text. \"The biggest victory is a broken globalist media that finds itself too frayed to cover our assault on the institutions of America's oppression.\"\nIt is a typically bombastic response. A wide variety of opinion polls, however, suggest the public is less enthusiastic. Trump's overall approval rating at this stage of his presidency, for example, is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, according to a joint ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released on the weekend.\nIn his usual fashion, Trump hit out at \"fake polls from fake news organisations\".\nBut do they suggest ailing support that could pose a problem for him down the line?\nIt is still early, of course, and Trump's base remains fully committed. Even so, the best laid plans of even the most cautious politicians can go awry. So after 100 days of action, is there anything that could derail Trump's promised agenda in the coming months?\nHere are three potential scenarios.\nTrump has spent many years talking about the good that tariffs could do for America's economy \u2013 and now he is trying to make it a reality.\nBut staking your presidency on a policy of global economic disruption comes with significant risks.\nTrump has already reacted to tanking global markets by announcing tariff pauses, and he has signalled he is ready to make a deal with China by recently making warmer comments than the earlier angry barbs aimed at Beijing.\nBut in July, steep tariffs on imports from any countries that do not have a trade deal with the US are set to come into force.\nCan the administration really agree 90 trade deals in 90 days as Trump has promised? If not, the president may find that his tariff regime and the potential for more market chaos begins to further shake his standing with voters.\nVoters who backed the president in November, at least many I have spoken to, appreciate the White House message that he is standing up to countries that have for decades taken advantage of the US and seeking to inject fresh life into American manufacturing.\nBut there is a tension between this message and what plays out on the ground -  not in diplomatic talks between leaders, but on main streets and in supermarkets as Americans go about their daily lives.\nTrump's tariff plans have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. And a poll by CBS News on Monday indicated there is a growing belief among voters that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices.\nThis feels key to the success of the Trump administration in coming months. Ambitions to reset the global trading order are one thing - and a popular one among the president's supporters at that - but handing the cost of this to the average American consumer by increasing taxes on virtually all imports is dangerous politically, even more so if the country were to tip into recession.\nImmigration has always been Trump's signature issue. He enjoys higher approval ratings on it than any other policy area, with polls suggesting a significant number of voters support his swift actions to deport thousands of undocumented migrants.\nAs the administration pursues this immigration crackdown, it may not be the views of voters that hamper Trump, but rulings from the nation's courts. Judges are repeatedly telling the White House that its actions may be in breach of the law.\nThe case of one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has already made it to the Supreme Court. The administration has admitted it made a mistake when deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador, but appears unwilling to follow a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" his return to the US.\nSo far, the White House has avoided the kind of clash with judges that could prompt a full-blown constitutional crisis, even as it has maneuvered around court rulings aimed at limiting some of its most radical policy moves. But a showdown may happen soon.\nThe ultimate confrontation, of course, would come if Trump chose to ignore an order from the Supreme Court.\nUntil now the administration has been happy to argue about deportations in the court of public opinion, convinced that voters are much more concerned about removing illegal immigrants from the country than they are about due process.\nMike Madrid, a Republican political consultant, agrees. He told me that, in his view, many people do not believe undocumented migrants deserve legal rights. \n\"If you frame it between giving them due process and getting terrorist gang members... Republicans are going to side with getting MS-13 members off the streets,\" he said.\nStill, public support for Trump's immigration moves could be slipping. A poll published late last week indicated his approval rating on the issue had fallen by 10 points in recent weeks.\nEven if voters are prepared to accept the White House ignoring court rulings, any such move could pose a significant challenge to many Republican members of Congress who feel squeamish about it. So far, the party's senators and representatives have virtually given Trump free rein to do whatever he likes. But could they remain silent when faced with a president defying the law?\nElon Musk and his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" have not wasted a minute of these 100 days, taking their chainsaw to large parts of the federal workforce and cutting government spending including on international aid.\nAs with much of Trump's agenda, there is a tension between the very real voter sympathy for the message - in this case, that the government is bloated, wasteful and inefficient - versus the extreme actions sometimes taken by the White House to address that message.\nAnd with DOGE, the political risk for the president could come if it begins to cut government spending and programmes that voters readily rely on. That is a real risk, as the anger at Musk is already bubbling up.\nMany elected Republicans have stopped holding open meetings for constituents, known as town halls, after being confronted by angry voters who are worried about cuts to their pensions or government-funded healthcare. \nTensions are also running high within Trump's cabinet over Musk's interference, culminating in a heated shouting match in the West Wing recently between the billionaire adviser and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe reality is that Musk is considerably less popular than Trump, and his expensive effort to influence a special election in Wisconsin fell completely flat with voters.\nThe tech billionaire will soon have to leave the president's side. He is under pressure from Tesla shareholders to return to his struggling car company, and as a \"special government employee\" he faces time limits on working within this administration. There is a world in which less-frequent appearances at the White House could prove to be in the best interests of Trump.\nBut while Musk may be leaving, DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 2026. That leaves plenty of opportunities for it to make deeply unpopular spending cuts, which is undoubtedly a longer-term political risk for this White House, especially ahead of next year's mid-term elections.\nFor now, however, Trump's 100-day blitz of orders, actions and noise has steamrolled opposition and proved popular with his loyal base, who say he is simply doing what he promised. \nThose risks, however, are there - and with an administration as unpredictable and fast-moving as this one, the potential for a crisis never truly goes away.",

        "article_text": "In the midst of \"the car capital of the world\", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.\nHome to the \"Motor City\" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called \"the car capital of the world\". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond. \nAhead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures. \n\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.\n\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"\nGeneral Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance. \nIn an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results. \nTariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.\nThe duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May. \nUnder the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US. \nThat share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.\nThe White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year. \nThe adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.\nIn remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.\n\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.  \nLast week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts. \nA letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".\nFord said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.\nThe car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".\n\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".\nStellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs. \n\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "Within hours of taking his second oath of office, Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders and declarations, and fired the starting gun on what has been a rapid and radical programme of change in his first 100 days.\nSo far, he has shown no sign of taking his foot off the pedal.\nThe sheer quantity of his news-generating actions over the past few months could be seen as a carefully considered strategy. It is one that Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcast host who advised Trump during his first term, first floated as long ago as 2018.\n\"The Democrats don't matter,\" Bannon told the writer Michael Lewis at the time. \"The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone.\"\nSo seven years on, with Trump back in the Oval Office and the zone not just flooded but virtually submerged, does Bannon think the strategy has worked?\n\"Flooding the Zone' is an overwhelming success,\" he tells me via text. \"The biggest victory is a broken globalist media that finds itself too frayed to cover our assault on the institutions of America's oppression.\"\nIt is a typically bombastic response. A wide variety of opinion polls, however, suggest the public is less enthusiastic. Trump's overall approval rating at this stage of his presidency, for example, is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, according to a joint ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released on the weekend.\nIn his usual fashion, Trump hit out at \"fake polls from fake news organisations\".\nBut do they suggest ailing support that could pose a problem for him down the line?\nIt is still early, of course, and Trump's base remains fully committed. Even so, the best laid plans of even the most cautious politicians can go awry. So after 100 days of action, is there anything that could derail Trump's promised agenda in the coming months?\nHere are three potential scenarios.\nTrump has spent many years talking about the good that tariffs could do for America's economy \u2013 and now he is trying to make it a reality.\nBut staking your presidency on a policy of global economic disruption comes with significant risks.\nTrump has already reacted to tanking global markets by announcing tariff pauses, and he has signalled he is ready to make a deal with China by recently making warmer comments than the earlier angry barbs aimed at Beijing.\nBut in July, steep tariffs on imports from any countries that do not have a trade deal with the US are set to come into force.\nCan the administration really agree 90 trade deals in 90 days as Trump has promised? If not, the president may find that his tariff regime and the potential for more market chaos begins to further shake his standing with voters.\nVoters who backed the president in November, at least many I have spoken to, appreciate the White House message that he is standing up to countries that have for decades taken advantage of the US and seeking to inject fresh life into American manufacturing.\nBut there is a tension between this message and what plays out on the ground -  not in diplomatic talks between leaders, but on main streets and in supermarkets as Americans go about their daily lives.\nTrump's tariff plans have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. And a poll by CBS News on Monday indicated there is a growing belief among voters that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices.\nThis feels key to the success of the Trump administration in coming months. Ambitions to reset the global trading order are one thing - and a popular one among the president's supporters at that - but handing the cost of this to the average American consumer by increasing taxes on virtually all imports is dangerous politically, even more so if the country were to tip into recession.\nImmigration has always been Trump's signature issue. He enjoys higher approval ratings on it than any other policy area, with polls suggesting a significant number of voters support his swift actions to deport thousands of undocumented migrants.\nAs the administration pursues this immigration crackdown, it may not be the views of voters that hamper Trump, but rulings from the nation's courts. Judges are repeatedly telling the White House that its actions may be in breach of the law.\nThe case of one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has already made it to the Supreme Court. The administration has admitted it made a mistake when deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador, but appears unwilling to follow a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" his return to the US.\nSo far, the White House has avoided the kind of clash with judges that could prompt a full-blown constitutional crisis, even as it has maneuvered around court rulings aimed at limiting some of its most radical policy moves. But a showdown may happen soon.\nThe ultimate confrontation, of course, would come if Trump chose to ignore an order from the Supreme Court.\nUntil now the administration has been happy to argue about deportations in the court of public opinion, convinced that voters are much more concerned about removing illegal immigrants from the country than they are about due process.\nMike Madrid, a Republican political consultant, agrees. He told me that, in his view, many people do not believe undocumented migrants deserve legal rights. \n\"If you frame it between giving them due process and getting terrorist gang members... Republicans are going to side with getting MS-13 members off the streets,\" he said.\nStill, public support for Trump's immigration moves could be slipping. A poll published late last week indicated his approval rating on the issue had fallen by 10 points in recent weeks.\nEven if voters are prepared to accept the White House ignoring court rulings, any such move could pose a significant challenge to many Republican members of Congress who feel squeamish about it. So far, the party's senators and representatives have virtually given Trump free rein to do whatever he likes. But could they remain silent when faced with a president defying the law?\nElon Musk and his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" have not wasted a minute of these 100 days, taking their chainsaw to large parts of the federal workforce and cutting government spending including on international aid.\nAs with much of Trump's agenda, there is a tension between the very real voter sympathy for the message - in this case, that the government is bloated, wasteful and inefficient - versus the extreme actions sometimes taken by the White House to address that message.\nAnd with DOGE, the political risk for the president could come if it begins to cut government spending and programmes that voters readily rely on. That is a real risk, as the anger at Musk is already bubbling up.\nMany elected Republicans have stopped holding open meetings for constituents, known as town halls, after being confronted by angry voters who are worried about cuts to their pensions or government-funded healthcare. \nTensions are also running high within Trump's cabinet over Musk's interference, culminating in a heated shouting match in the West Wing recently between the billionaire adviser and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe reality is that Musk is considerably less popular than Trump, and his expensive effort to influence a special election in Wisconsin fell completely flat with voters.\nThe tech billionaire will soon have to leave the president's side. He is under pressure from Tesla shareholders to return to his struggling car company, and as a \"special government employee\" he faces time limits on working within this administration. There is a world in which less-frequent appearances at the White House could prove to be in the best interests of Trump.\nBut while Musk may be leaving, DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 2026. That leaves plenty of opportunities for it to make deeply unpopular spending cuts, which is undoubtedly a longer-term political risk for this White House, especially ahead of next year's mid-term elections.\nFor now, however, Trump's 100-day blitz of orders, actions and noise has steamrolled opposition and proved popular with his loyal base, who say he is simply doing what he promised. \nThose risks, however, are there - and with an administration as unpredictable and fast-moving as this one, the potential for a crisis never truly goes away.",

        "article_text": "River's Franco Mastantuono and Boca's Edinson Cavani will likely play key roles on Sunday\nWhen it comes to football derbies, very little comes close to matching the passion, intensity and cultural significance of Argentina's Superclasico between River Plate and Boca Juniors.\nSuperstar players, fanatical fans, regular helpings of drama and the sinister side of the game - the Superclasico has it all.\nOn Sunday, River's 85,000-capacity Mas Monumental stadium will host the 264th Superclasico on matchday 15 of the Torneo Apertura, the first half of the Argentine top-flight season. \nBoca are looking to avenge a 1-0 home defeat in September and clinch top spot in Apertura Zone A, while River need to build momentum before the knockout rounds after a mixed start to the season.\nWhatever the outcome, it promises to be some spectacle.\nNot only are River and Boca local rivals in Buenos Aires, they are the two biggest clubs in Argentina and indeed two of the superpowers in South America. As many as 80% of Argentines support one of the two clubs.\nTheir trophy cabinets match their popularity.\nRiver have 38 top-flight titles and four Copas Libertadores to their name, while Boca have won the league title on 35 occasions and the Libertadores on six, with three of those triumphs coming during a golden age between 2000 and 2003.\nBoth have also counted some of the greatest players of all time among their ranks. \nRiver alumni include Alfredo di Stefano, Enzo Francescoli and Daniel Passarella, while Boca fans have worshipped Carlos Tevez, Juan Roman Riquelme and Diego Maradona.\nThere is naturally a lot at stake on derby day - Boca fans take great pride in the fact they lead River 92 wins to 87 in the overall Superclasico record. But the rivalry goes way beyond 90 minutes on a football pitch.\n\"It is rooted in their origins, or rather their respective foundational myths,\" Argentine football journalist Santi Bauza tells BBC Sport.\nThe close geographical proximity of the clubs when they were founded - River in 1901 and Boca four years later - created tension.\nOne fan is said to have burned the flag of the opposition during one early meeting, while a Superclasico in 1931 was abandoned after 31 minutes because of mass fighting.\nThe schism widened when River Plate - after joining their rivals in the working-class neighbourhood of La Boca - relocated to the well-to-do suburb of Recoleta up the road, then further north to Nunez, where they reside today.\nDeserting their working-class home and spending big on players - the 35,000 pesos (\u00a31,350) fee paid for Bernabe Ferreyra in 1932 set an Argentine transfer record that stood for 20 years - led to River becoming known as 'Los Millonarios'. The Millionaires.\nBy contrast, Boca have always remained in their spiritual home, the famous La Bombonera stadium that is seemingly dropped into the middle of the 'barrio', a high-poverty district of the city.\nTheir Italian immigrant, working-class roots are a central part of their identity. Little shows this more than the club's nickname 'Xeneize', which comes from the Ligurian dialect word for Genoese.\nA Superclasico without some sort of scuffle does not feel like a Superclasico\nThe division between the clubs is reflected on the pitch in both playing styles and full-blooded encounters.\n\"River have traditionally favoured a more aesthetic brand of football, with their more demanding fans barely even celebrating hard-fought or undeserved wins,\" explains Bauza. \nRiver fans often speak of the three Gs - Gustar (to play well), Ganar (to win) and Golear (to score lots of goals).\n\"Our club is known for its beautiful style of play, excellent ball control, an attacking mindset, and a philosophy that sees attacking the opposition's goal as the best form of defence,\" River club president Jorge Brito tells BBC Sport.\nThat mentality is juxtaposed by the popular Boca motto 'transpira a la camiseta', which means to 'make the shirt sweat'. Passion and fight are non-negotiable.\n\"Boca pride themselves in being a win-at-all-costs kind of side,\" says Bauza.\n\"Over the years they have both become so massive and ubiquitous in Argentine society that the rich-poor narrative doesn't hold up as much now, but they are still largely identified by those footballing philosophies.\"\nInsult culture in Argentina has given rise to some incredibly petty nicknames.\nSince throwing away a half-time lead to lose to Penarol in the 1966 Copa Libertadores final, Boca fans have called River 'Gallinas' - 'little chickens'.\nIn a 2004 Superclasico, Boca striker Carlos Tevez was sent off for performing a chicken dance in celebration.\nBoca are known as 'Los Bosteros' - 'the manure handlers' - as a factory that used horse manure to make bricks once stood behind La Bombonera. Opposition players have been known to hold their noses when entering the pitch.\nBoca's La Bombonera stadium often shakes during matches\nArgentina is obsessed with football, so it is no surprise that meetings between its two biggest clubs are seismic events.\n\"The Superclasico stops the country in its tracks,\" says Bauza.\n\"Regardless of their form or success, it's always a game that defines the mood of players, managers, pundits and fans alike.\n\"Storylines can emerge or change overnight depending on what happens.\"\nOne of the main highlights of the Superclasico is actually what happens in the stands rather than on the pitch.\nGiant tifos and choreographed displays are common, singing is non-stop and the atmosphere is spine-tingling.\nBut there is a dark side to the world's most intense derby.\nThe Barras Brava - a gang-like organised fan group - rule the terraces in Argentina and have huge influence over club issues like ticketing, merchandising and car parking.\nRiver Plate's Mas Monumental stadium can accommodate 85,000 people after expansion\nAlthough they bring the noise and passion that makes Argentine football so special, their intrinsic links to organised crime, violence and homicide can make stadiums dangerous places.\nWhen River were relegated to the second division in 2011 for the first time in their history, the players were locked inside the dressing room for three hours while fans rioted and burned parts of El Monumental.\nIn 2015 Boca were thrown out of the Libertadores when the River squad were sprayed with pepper spray when emerging for the second half.\nThe second leg of the 2018 Libertadores final - the highest-profile game in Superclasico history - was postponed after police tear gas, used to disperse River fans who had smashed windows on the Boca bus with projectiles as it sped towards Mas Monumental, affected the visiting players.\nThe competition - named after those who liberated South America from Spanish rule - was concluded in Madrid.\nWhile River are assured of a place in the last 16 of the Apertura and top their Libertadores group, a mixture of pre-season squad upheaval and injuries have contributed to an inconsistent start to the year.\nBut beat Boca on Sunday and everything will look a lot rosier.\n\"It is always special. This game is the one you wait for, and nothing else matters when it comes to how it feels to win or lose against them,\" says journalist and River fan Andres Bruckner.\nWhile Boca have had a week to prepare, River flew more than six hours to Ecuador for a 2-2 draw with Independiente del Valle in the Libertadores on Wednesday.\n\"I always think we will win, but playing Libertadores midweek makes things tricky,\" says Bruckner.\n\"In moments like these, with so many doubts, a defeat would put a great question mark over all the players, and supporters will show anger.\"\nWith 85,000 fans now able to cram into the recently expanded Mas Monumental, the pressure to win has never been greater.\n\"I wouldn't mind losing five games in a row if we get the win on Sunday,\" admits broadcaster and River fan Juan Igal. \n\"Boca is the thing I hate the most, and seeing the sadness in their fans and players makes me happy.\"\nRiver Plate won the most recent Superclasico, a 1-0 victory at Boca's La Bombonera in September\nWith many of the players responsible for River's success in recent years now moved on - the sales of Julian Alvarez and Claudio Echeverri to Manchester City typify the struggle of Argentine clubs to retain their best young talent - manager Marcelo Gallardo has placed a lot of faith in 17-year-old starlet Franco Mastantuono.\nBoca started the season poorly - they won just one of their opening four Apertura games and were eliminated in the Libertadores qualifiers - but nine wins in their last 10 league games have sent them three points clear at the top of the table.\nCarlos Palacios and Kevin Zenon have stood out for Boca this season, while the likes of Edinson Cavani and Luis Advincula provide experience and relative calm.\n\"Boca fans die for every game, but we live for Copa Libertadores nights and Superclasicos. It's a game unlike any other,\" says Rodrigo Azurmendi, Boca fan and co-host of the Boca in English Podcast.\n\"Winning means going all out on the jokes, the memes and the folklore against our friends on the other side. Losing means skipping work on Monday.\"\nFor some, the idea of defeat on Sunday is too much to bear. \n\"I can't think about losing, I just don't have it in me,\" Boca fan Rob Smith says.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

Traffic lights being affected led to the mayor of Madrid to ask residents to keep the roads clear as tunnels of certain highways were closed. \nAccording to aviation analytics firm Cirium, Lisbon airport had the most (29.6%) departure cancellations in Portugal by Monday evening. A total of nine flights from the UK to Portugal were also grounded.\nThe BBC understands that Lisbon airport has limited its flow rates - effectively not allowing planes to arrive or there are delays getting planes in, which then knocks on to the tight system of airport operations, where planes normally arrive and leave in strict timeframes.\nBarcelona and Madrid made up the majority of cancellations from Spanish airports, but zero flights from the UK to Spain have been scrapped, according to Cirium.\nDavid Gleave, an aviation investigator, told the BBC any interruption to power supplies at airports would not affect air traffic control as \"a battery will kick in a maximum of a second later, so airplanes are safe\".\n\"From then on, a diesel-powered generator will keep power running so air traffic control can function,\" he added.\nHe said it was likely airports in Spain and Portugal have independent power supplies, \"which will see big diesel generators which fire off when it senses no power from its usual grid supply\".\nEnaire, Spain's air navigation organisation, confirmed that a back-up generator had meant air traffic management operations were continuing to run from its five control centres.\n\"Appropriate regulations are being implemented to ensure the complete safety of operations,\" it added.\nIberia, Spain's national airline confirmed on X that despite the widespread power outage its systems were \"operating at 100%\".\n\"However, given the difficulties at several airports, we are offering all passengers with flights scheduled for today the option to reschedule their trip,\" it said.\nWhile some flights are running as normal, the issues impacted the roads and public transport is likely to be a problem for travellers trying to get to airports.\nSpain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente said it was not likely that medium and long-distance trains would resume normal service on Monday.\nHe said the plan was to resume shorter-distance commuter services as soon as electricity supplies had been restored.

A total of nine flights from the UK to Portugal were also grounded.The BBC understands that Lisbon airport has limited its flow rates - effectively not allowing planes to arrive or there are delays getting planes in, which then knocks on to the tight system of airport operations, where planes normally arrive and leave in strict timeframes.Barcelona and Madrid made up the majority of cancellations from Spanish airports, but zero flights from the UK to Spain have been scrapped, according to Cirium.David Gleave, an aviation investigator, told the BBC any interruption to power supplies at airports would not affect air traffic control as \"a battery will kick in a maximum of a second later, so airplanes are safe\". \"From then on, a diesel-powered generator will keep power running so air traffic control can function,\" he added.He said it was likely airports in Spain and Portugal have independent power supplies, \"which will see big diesel generators which fire off when it senses no power from its usual grid supply\".Enaire, Spain's air navigation organisation, confirmed that a back-up generator had meant air traffic management operations were continuing to run from its five control centres. Work is also under way to rescue people trapped on stranded services.SpainTravelTransportPortugalInfrastructureAir travel \"However, given the difficulties at several airports, we are offering all passengers with flights scheduled for today the option to reschedule their trip,\" it said.While some flights are running as normal, the issues impacted the roads and public transport is likely to be a problem for travellers trying to get to airports.Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente said it was not likely that medium and long-distance trains would resume normal service on Monday.He said the plan was to resume shorter-distance commuter services as soon as electricity supplies had been restored.",

        "article_text": "After great reviews and buzz, Ryan Coogler's vampire film had an extraordinary second weekend at the box office. It's a victory for a wholly original big-budget film in a cinema landscape dominated by familiar franchises.\nIn less than a fortnight since it was released, Sinners has already made more money at the US box office than Disney's Snow White. Could Ryan Coogler's vampire film go on to overtake two more of this year's Disney hits, Mufasa: The Lion King and Captain America: Brave New World? It's definitely possible. The Hollywood Reporter calls Sinners a \"rule-defying\" proposition that \"continues to defy all the odds\", because it was almost as lucrative in its second weekend in US cinemas as it was in its first, earning $45m (\u00a334m) against its opening $48m (\u00a336m). \"Put another way, Sinners boasts the smallest second-weekend decline for any film opening north of $40m since 2009's Avatar and the smallest ever for an R-rated horror title,\" says the article. Meanwhile The Wrap predicts that it will be \"the highest-grossing original live-action film in the US since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in 2013\". Its current worldwide box office total stands at $161m (\u00a3120m), against a $90m (\u00a367m) budget, and it likely has a long distance left to run. Sinners is a winner \u2013 just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that \"profitability remains a question mark\".\nPerhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. The director of Creed and the Black Panther films, Coogler is adept at taking familiar Hollywood genres (sports drama, superhero blockbuster) and putting his own distinctive-yet-crowd-pleasing stamp on them. But he has gone a step further than usual this time. Featuring Michael B Jordan as a pair of twins defending their juke joint from vampires, Sinners is a horror film \u2013 but it's also a blues musical, a gangster thriller and a deeply-researched period drama about Mississippi in the 1930s. It doesn't stick to the rules of one particular genre, and it isn't based on existing intellectual property (IP), so audiences don't come to it knowing how it's all going to play out. Thanks also to some carefully-vague trailers, viewers get to discover the story for themselves \u2013 which is an increasingly rare treat. Reviewing a new Hollywood film often comes down to answering one question: \"Is it slightly better or slightly worse than every other Marvel/ DC/ Star Wars/ Alien /Jurassic World/ King Kong film I've seen?\" But Sinners is idiosyncratic enough to prompt other questions, which may explain its box office momentum, as word-of-mouth has spread.\nThis unorthodox quality is a sign of the freedom that Coogler felt when he was making it. All of his previous films were adapted from other material \u2013 or from true events, in the case of his debut, Fruitvale Station \u2013 but he told The Atlantic that with Sinners, he didn't want to use IP as \"something to hide behind\". He wanted to make the most personal film he could \u2013 a \"love letter\" to a late uncle from Mississippi \u2013 and that meant a film which didn't follow conventions.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 10 of the best films of 2025 so far\n\u2022 The best films to watch in April\n\u2022 Warfare review: it 'does what film does best'\nIn some ways it could be filed alongside two other films with \"must-see\" and \"must-talk-about\" appeal, 2024's The Substance and 2023's Saltburn. Sinners is a far bigger commercial success than they were, but each offer transgressive, sexually charged, gore-smeared excitement, none of them is based on a superhero comic, a video game or an earlier film, and each expresses the vision of a writer-director being allowed to do their own thing. (And their titles all begin with S, but that could be a coincidence.) The fact that it is so tricky to say which genre they belong to is a key factor. Is The Substance primarily a body-horror film or a Hollywood satire? Is Saltburn a crime thriller or a class comedy? All of these films stir different ingredients together to cook something unexpected. As Coogler put it to The Atlantic: \"I wanted it to feel like you were reading Salem's Lot while listening to the best blues record, eating a bowl of spicy gumbo.\"\nThat could be why, anecdotes suggest, many people are already paying to see Sinners more than once. Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, they know that they're going to discover more on a second viewing. And they know that they're going to have a good time while they're doing it. Maybe if they go for third and fourth viewings, too, Hollywood might decide that original, auteur-driven, big-budget films shouldn't be quite as rare in the cinema landscape as they are today.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

But were it any other fighter, an 11-year age gap would prompt discussions about a passing-of-the-torch moment, but such is Usyk's pedigree he will be clear favourite.The fight will represent a full-circle moment for Dubois, whose mental fortitude was called into question after his loss to Usyk almost three years ago in Poland.There was also the small matter of the controversy of the low blow as Dubois was mere centimetres away from knocking down Usyk and perhaps finishing the fight. \"This is the fight I wanted and demanded and now I get my chance for revenge,\" said Dubois. There are not many who would have predicted Dubois would be the one to knock Usyk off his perch - that was supposed to be Fury - but in July, on home turf, Dubois will have the chance to banish demons and claim his spot at the top of the heavyweight mountain.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 January",

        "article_text": "At least 68 African migrants have been killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in Houthi-controlled north-western Yemen, the armed group's TV channel says.\nAl Masirah reported that another 47 migrants were injured, most of them critically, when the centre in Saada province was bombed. It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.\nA US defence official said the US military's Central Command was aware of the claims of civilian casualties.\nThe strike came hours after Central Command announced its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.\nIt said the strikes had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders\", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.\nHouthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.\nThe migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit four times shortly before 05:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Monday, according to Al Masirah.\nThe casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but Al Masirah's videos showed first responders recovering the bodies of at least a dozen men among pieces of concrete and metal debris on the floor of a large building with partially destroyed walls and no roof.\nAt a local hospital, another injured man told Al Masirah: \"The strike hit us while we were sleeping, that's it.\"\nFollowing a visit to the scene, the chairman of the Somali community in Yemen,  Ibrahim Cabdulqaadir Macallin, told the BBC: \"It was tragic and horrific... I saw burnt people. We couldn't recognise some of the bodies we saw.\"\nHe said the number of Somali migrants who were killed was \"very small\" because a group had been removed from the detention centre three days earlier, and that the majority of the detainees were Ethiopians.\nHe also said that the facility was in an \"open area\" and \"not near any military base\".\nThe Houthi-run interior ministry condemned what it called the \"deliberate bombing\" of the facility and said it constituted a \"war crime\".\nThe US defence official said Central Command took the claims of civilian casualties very seriously, and that it was currently conducting a battle-damage assessment and inquiry into them.\nThe UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was \"deeply saddened by the reports of the tragic loss of life in Saada\".\n\"While IOM has not been operating at this facility, we remain committed to closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to offer support as needed,\" it added.\n\"We call on all parties to the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians and ensure full respect for international laws.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said teams from the Yemen Red Crescent Society provided lifesaving support by evacuating the wounded to hospitals and were ensuring a dignified management of the dead. \nIn 2022, at least 66 people were reportedly killed when the Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen's government struck a pre-trial detention facility only 100m (330ft) away from the location of Monday's attack.\nAl Masirah also reported that another eight people had been killed in overnight US air strikes in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa.\nThe statement put out by Centcom late on Sunday said the US had \"intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations\" in order to \"preserve operational security\".\nDespite the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, motivated by political and economic instability, droughts and other extreme weather events in their own countries.\nMost of them are intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work. Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the IOM.\nIn 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive. The majority of them are Ethiopians and Somalis.\nThousands of migrants are thought to be held in detention centres like the one in Saada, but there are no official statistics from the Houthi-run authorities. Rights groups say detainees experience dire conditions, including overcrowding, abuse and poor sanitation.\nEarlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".\nCentcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would \"begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities\".\nLast month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.\nOn Sunday, Centcom said it would \"continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region\".\nOn Monday evening, the Houthis' military spokesman said its forces had retaliated for the US \"aggression and massacres against civilians\" by targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier battle group with \"a number of cruise and ballistic missiles and drones\".\nHe also said the group had launched a drone towards the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel's military announced earlier that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nThe Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.\nAfter taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.\nYemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated in 2015 when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.\nThe fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.",

        "article_text": "Cristina Horez, an influencer from the Northern city of Iasi \nRomanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.\nFar-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.\nGeorgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".\nThe leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.\nHe is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.\nAt the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.\nProtesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections. \nPro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.\nGeorgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%. \nHe declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning. \nInstead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.\nAn independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".\nAuthorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.\nThe authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".\nSeparately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.\nBut authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians. \nThe Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.\nCalin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election\nShortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\". \nThey did not name a specific candidate.\nThey had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it. \nFameUp declined to comment to the BBC.\nCristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".\nSome influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.\nWhile the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"\nThe comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".\nIt is still not clear who created these bot accounts.\nExperts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.\nA TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".\n\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.\nThe uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January. \nThe Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections. \nIn response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.\nRomeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents\nThen, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.\nThe prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts. \nHis lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".\nWe spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts. \nHe says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.\nElgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.\nElgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"\nMuch is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.\nIt's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.\n\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"\nAdditional reporting by Georgiana Tudor and Oana Marocico.",

        "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes has led Manchester United into the Europa League semi-finals, but they will finish in the bottom half of the Premier League\nAfter an hour of Manchester United's draw at Bournemouth, their travelling support struck up a familiar refrain.\n\"Twenty times, 20 times, Man United. Twenty times, 20 times, I say. Twenty times, 20 times, Man United, playing football the Matt Busby way.\"\nThe song has been a source of both pride and solace since United won the most recent of those championships to ease Sir Alex Ferguson into retirement in 2013.\nOn Sunday, it felt particularly poignant. \nAt the time they sang, those supporters did not know the day would end with Liverpool being crowned champions. But they knew it was coming. That very soon, their fierce rivals would join them on the total that had previously meant they stood alone as the most successful team in English football.\nAnd while Rasmus Hojlund's injury-time equaliser prevented them experiencing yet another defeat in this torturous domestic campaign as they drew 1-1 at the Vitality Stadium, there is no disguising the reality of the situation.\n\"Oh yes, it matters,\" said Adam Bell - a long-time United fan, who started following the club in 1973-74, just as they were about to be relegated.\n\"It was really important for us to get to 20. Now they are joining us and you have to say they have a better chance of getting to 21 and 22 than we have.\"\nHis friend Andrew Harris agreed.\n\"But if you look back,\" he said, \"this kind of thing happens in cycles at Manchester United.\n\"We had the Busby Babes and the 1968 team, then we dropped back in the 1970s and 1980s, then Fergie came. Now we are in the next Ice Age.\"\nAfter David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag tried, it is Ruben Amorim's turn to attempt to prise United out of the deep freeze.\nHis results since replacing Ten Hag in November have been patchy.\nThe draw at Bournemouth means United have collected two points from their past five games. It lifted them a place to 14th but they are still heading for their worst finish since the relegation season over half a century ago. The nadir since then was 13th place in 1989-90, when Liverpool won their 18th league crown.\nWhat Amorim has done is to understand the history around Old Trafford.\nTo his credit, he also refuses to dodge a question.\nLiverpool and their achievements, he said, were not his concern. What he thinks about Manchester United is another matter.\n\"The first thing is to focus on ourselves and not on the other teams,\" he said. \"The next thing is to be really honest.\n\"We are in different levels [to Liverpool] in this moment. But I remember when I start seeing Premier League, was the opposite. So, everything can change.\"\nAmorim said United must not try to think too far ahead.\n\"We have an ultimate goal that is winning the Premier League,\" he said. \"I'm not crazy, I know it's not going to be next year. But we are trying to build something and the small things we did during this year are really important.\n\"We need to improve next year, we know that.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMan Utd deserved late draw at Bournemouth - Amorim\nThere is support for Amorim in the fanbase, even if they don't all feel the salvation that would come from a Europa League triumph this season is realistic.\nIn an ordinary season, a two-legged semi-final with Athletic Bilbao - fourth in La Liga - would be regarded as tricky. Ferguson's team couldn't beat them in a 2011-12 Europa League last-16 tie when Andoni Iraola - now Bournemouth manager - played for them.\nThis season, many fans will have hope rather than expectation.\nVictory in the final in Bilbao - which, of course, offers United's opponents even more incentive - not only provides Champions League riches but is also their only route back into Europe full stop.\n\"I hope the project to rebuild works but it is going to take a few years,\" said Bell. \"Even winning the Europa League is a long shot.\n\"I like Amorim. I am positive about him, but we need patience. It takes time to build a team and make them successful. It took Sir Alex Ferguson a long time.\"\nFerguson was three and three-quarter seasons into his tenure before he delivered the trophy that changed United's history for the better. The parallels with that season and this are impossible to ignore given the respective league positions.\nThere was no social media then, no 24-hour rolling news cycle and endless talk on infinite platforms for opinion to be expressed on the club's dysfunctional results.\n\"Two to three years\" was Bell's assessment on the time Amorim will need.\nHis friend is not so sure.\n\"Ten,\" he said, referring back to his Ice Age comment, \"using the same Glacial calendar.\n\"It is not going to be instant, that's for sure.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

Trump has previously blamed Ukraine for starting the war and has accused Zelensky multiple times of being an obstacle to peace negotiations. \nBut the White House struck a more positive tone about Saturday's meeting, while Zelensky described the sit down as a \"very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results\".\nTwo images were released of the meeting, showing the US leader in a blue suit and Ukrainian president in a black top and trousers, sitting opposite each other in intense conversation.\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also posted an image of the meeting on X with the caption: \"No words are needed to describe the importance of this historic meeting. Two leaders working for peace in St. Peter's Basilica.\"\nAnother image posted by the Ukrainian delegation from inside St Peter's showed the two men standing alongside British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron, his hand on Zelensky's shoulder. \nThe implication was that the prime minister and French president had helped to bring the two together, against the sombre backdrop of the funeral.\nAfter the meeting, Trump and Zelensky walked down the steps of the basilica, where Zelensky's arrival was met with applause from the crowds, and took their seats in the front row. \nDuring the service, the pair sat a short distance from each other, with Macron and other heads of state in between.\nIn his homily, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re spoke of Pope Francis's incessant calls for peace. \"'Build bridges, not walls' was an exhortation he repeated many times,\" said the cardinal.\nUkrainian officials had talked of a possible second meeting but Trump's motorcade drove away from St Peter's immediately afterwards and his plane left Rome a short time later.\nZelensky however later met Macron in the garden of Villa Bonaparte, home to the French embassy to the Holy See, and Sir Keir at Zelensky and Starmer together too at Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence. He also met EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\nIn a post on X, Macron said ending the war in Ukraine was an objective that \"we share in common with President Trump\", adding that Ukraine was ready for \"an unconditional ceasefire\".\nA Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer and Zelensky discussed the positive progress that had been made recently to \"secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\" adding that the pair had agreed to \"maintain momentum\" and \"speak again at the earliest opportunity\".\nDuring February's heated White House exchange, Trump accused the Ukrainian president of \"gambling with World War Three\" by not going along with ceasefire plans led by Washington.\nKyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war.\nThese concessions would reportedly include giving up large portions of land, including the Crimean peninsula which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.\nZelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea in the past. He suggested to the BBC on Friday that \"a full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything\".",

It's going to be exciting, the first six rounds will be explosive.''\nRetired world champion Tony Bellew: ''I think Conor Benn will get to Eubank. If he does get through those first five or six rounds, he's took what Conor's got and he starts unloading himself. It's a fight of two halves. Neither's defence is that good and both of them want to get at to each other, bad.''\nRetired world champion Barry Jones: \"I think Eubank wins on points. Benn might be able to tough it out as he is a tough kid, but I don't know if he has the ability. Eubank can't make middleweight no more, it drains him and he beat an old Liam Smith in their rematch. But he's a massive guy, so if he's able to rehydrate correctly, he is just too fast and too big.\"\nHeavyweight Fabio Wardley: \"My initial feeling is Eubank will get the win. The weight factor will play quite a big part, asking Benn to come up two weights is a lot against someone who is naturally comfortable fighting at that weight. Benn can carry some strong power at his weight, but there is a large difference when those punches which you hit in your previous weight would take them out but a bigger guy is more used to taking bigger shots and they don't have the same effect.\"\nScotland's first female world champion Hannah Rankin: \"I think it will be a later-round stoppage from Eubank. Experience and size is in his favour. I will be very surprised if Benn gets the win. Eubank is stronger. He's been in there with solid opponents that have tested his chin.

I'm 50/50 but I'll go with Benn because I want him to win because of his family and legacy.\"\nFormer cruiserweight world champion Johnny Nelson: \"I'm saying Eubank because he had more consistency in his career. Benn's style is so ferocious and attacking that should suit Eubank in the first six rounds.\"\nLight-heavyweight Anthony Yarde: \"If Benn wins it is because he goes in with controlled aggression and detonates when he needs to. If Benn hurts Eubank then he is good at finishing. If Eubank wins then it's being himself but an aggressive version of himself. He needs to be switched on.

        "article_text": "Miami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Dates: 2-4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary of practice and qualifying online and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; race on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nFormula 1 heads to the United States this weekend for the Miami Grand Prix, the sixth round of the 2025 world championship.\nLast time out in Saudi Arabia, McLaren's Oscar Piastri won his third race of the season to take the lead in the drivers' standings. \nA year ago, Miami was the scene of Lando Norris' first F1 victory.\nBefore this year's race, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.\nWould it be fair to say Lando Norris is faster than Oscar Piastri, but Piastri is a better racing driver? \u2013 Rob\nThe comparison between McLaren team-mates Norris and Piastri - as drivers, and as personalities - is one of many interesting aspects of this season.\nThat's because they are such contrasting people. Piastri is the epitome of robustness. Nothing seems to faze him. Even the weekends when he is a little off Norris' pace he seems to take in his stride. As Max Verstappen pointed out in Jeddah, he is very \"solid\" and he rarely makes mistakes.\nNorris, on the other hand, wears his heart on his sleeve. He seems to be a little more prey to the twisting fortunes of life. He beats himself up about his weaknesses. And he seems more prone to small errors that can have an impact in a title campaign.\nThat was happening last year, and it's still happening this.\nLast year, the question asked above would have been considered fair comment. Norris was definitively faster than Piastri in 2024. He out-qualified him 20 times to four, at an average of 0.147secs. And he won four races to Piastri's two.\nYet Piastri's race-craft was plain for all to see - for example in his superb overtaking move on Norris on the first lap in Monza, or to take the lead and eventually win against Charles Leclerc in Baku.\nBut this season? Piastri has three wins and two poles and Norris one of each. Piastri is 4-2 ahead in qualifying at an average of 0.185secs a lap.\nAnd he's leading the championship despite his unfortunate escapade on the wet grass in Melbourne, which dropped him to ninth at the flag having been challenging Norris for the lead from the start.\nNorris is incredibly fast. But there has never been any doubt that Piastri's highs were at least as good as the Briton's. \nAustralian Piastri came into this season setting himself a target of accessing them much more consistently.\nSo far, he is bang on target. Add that to his robustness, and he is going to make a tough title rival for anyone.\nDo you think Max Verstappen can sustain his amazing run in a car that some have labelled as \"fourth fastest\" or has he been helped by the characteristics of the tracks visited so far? \u2013 Steve\nVery few people in F1 doubt that Verstappen is the all-round best driver on the grid, and that's because his performances have been so strong for so long.\nThe Red Bull driver has been operating at a consistent level of excellence since, basically, the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix, the race he finally ironed out the series of errors that blighted his start to that season. So there is no reason to believe that's about to change.\nHe simply always seems to get the best out of his car, apart from on the odd occasions when he allows tangles with other drivers to get the better of him, such as in Mexico and Hungary last year.\nAs for the Red Bull car, on average qualifying pace, it's second fastest to McLaren by 0.177secs so far, and ahead of the Mercedes and the Ferrari.\nOf course, Verstappen's performances are a factor in that statistic - it's his car that is the fastest Red Bull. But is he definitively faster over one lap than Charles Leclerc and George Russell?\nHe may be, a bit. He may not be. But would he be, for example, consistently 0.135secs a lap faster than Leclerc in qualifying - the gap between Red Bull and Ferrari this year? No one knows for sure. And the answer can only be subjective. But few doubt Leclerc's pace over one lap.\nSo far, the Red Bull has been a fast car, in Verstappen's hands, on certain types of track. It is quick in high-speed corners, and slow. But it lags behind McLaren in long, medium-speed corners, which emphasise its often inconsistent balance.\nThat's why Verstappen was quick in Australia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but not so in China and Bahrain.\nRed Bull believe they can fix their issues with some upgrades that are due soon, perhaps for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in two races' time.\nBut McLaren are hardly likely to stand still in terms of development.\nVerstappen will get the very best out of the Red Bull, and stay in the title fight as long as he can.\nBut as Fernando Alonso pointed out recently, it's very difficult to sustain a season-long title challenge with a car deficit.\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nChequered Flag Extra: Steiner, Verstappen & Will Cadillac Be Competitive?\nCan Ferrari turn this season around and be in contention for either championship? \u2013 Laura\nAfter five races this season, Ferrari have a sprint victory in China, courtesy of Lewis Hamilton, a single grand prix podium finish, thanks to Charles Leclerc in Saudi Arabia, and lie fourth in the constructors' championship, already 110 points behind leaders McLaren.\nTheir car is the fourth quickest on average on raw performance - 0.312 seconds a lap slower than McLaren in qualifying.\nIt's fair to say this is significantly below their expectations.\nTeam boss Frederic Vasseur predicted over the winter that this season would be as open as last year, that the advantage would swing between the top four teams from race to race. And there is no secret that Ferrari were expecting to start the season in a competitive position and mount a title challenge from the off.\nVasseur believes they can turn their season around. He has repeatedly pointed to last season, and the fact that they were in a less competitive position at the same point in 2024 but transformed their car and came close to winning the constructors' title at the end of the year.\nThey also made an effective job of developing the 2023 car, which was vicious at the start of the season, but much better by the end of it.\nAn upgrade is due soon, although Ferrari have not said at which race.\nThe complication for Ferrari is that they have two sizeable problems.\nThe first is the performance of their car. The second is the performance of Hamilton, which could turn into a major distraction if the seven-time champion cannot improve after three dismal races in Japan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\nIf neither of those improve soon, the pressure will start to mount.\nLewis Hamilton described his Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as \"horrible\" after finishing seventh, 31 seconds behind team-mate Charles Leclerc\nWhy do the regulations change just when the field is beginning to close up in competitiveness? The new regs for 2026 seem like a lottery for teams who either nail or fail them, leading to a dominant team and those lagging behind. Stable regs = competitive racing. \u2013 Matt\nF1 has always changed its regulations from time to time. It's an inevitable and necessary part of the sport.\nOften in the past, it has been because the governing body felt the need to intervene in some way.\nPerhaps because the cars were getting too fast or dangerous, such as at the end of the last ground-effect era in 1982, or when Ayrton Senna was killed in 1994. Or to change an aspect of racing that was no longer considered desirable, such as when refuelling was banned for 2010. Or to add an aspect that was felt to be lacking, such as when wider, faster cars were introduced in 2017.\nAnd the engine rules have also often changed, again for various reasons.\nThis time, the starting point was the engine rules. F1 and the FIA wanted to make the sport more attractive to new manufacturers. So they set up some working groups involving the manufacturers and came up with the 2026 rules.\nThese retain 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, which recovers energy from the turbo and is highly complex and was considered a barrier to new suppliers.\nThey have also upped the electrical capacity so that about 50% of the total power output will come from the electrical part of the engine, and will run on 100% sustainable fuel.\nIt has worked. Audi came in - which was the idea behind changing the rules. Porsche in the end did not. But Ford has come back, in partnership with Red Bull. Honda is staying when it was going to pull out. And General Motors is entering next year, too, although its engine won't be ready until 2029.\nThere was already a desire to refine the chassis rules, to fix some of the issues that have arisen with the 2022 ground-effect regs. But the new engine rules required further changes.\nIt became clear that recovering sufficient energy to supply the batteries was going to be a problem. So the rule-makers turned to moveable aerodynamics, reducing drag on the straights so the cars were in the braking zones for longer.\nWrangling is still going on about this topic, although the rules are not expected to change significantly - for example by limiting the electrical deployment in races, as some are pushing at the moment - as there is a blocking majority preventing it.\nYes, this might open up the field, but that often happens with new rules. But it will close again. It also provides opportunity for a shake-up of the competitive order, which is often regarded as a positive.\nSeeing as Mercedes dominated the first eight years of the engine regulations when the V6 engines came in, do you see them building that sort of dominance again from the new regulations? - Keegan\nJust because Mercedes nailed the last new engine rules in 2014, does not necessarily mean they will do so again in 2026.\nBasically, Mercedes achieved that because they invested more resources sooner into those rules than their rivals. The other manufacturers have learned from that experience.\nHaving said that, the word in F1 is that Mercedes are currently best placed for the new rules. \nMany believe that what's motivating the current debate about the engine rules - whether it be changing them again earlier than originally planned, or tinkering with the 2026 rules - is founded in the concerns of Mercedes' rivals - especially Red Bull - that they may face a competitive deficit next year.\nOne interesting angle to emerge in recent weeks is that senior sources say that the FIA's single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis is telling teams and manufacturers that the governing body doesn't want engines to be a performance differentiator in the future.\nBut that raises a major philosophical question. Why not? Engines have always been a performance differentiator. It's called motorsport, after all. Cars don't move without engines.\nAnd who decided this? Was this agreed with the other stakeholders first?\nIt appears not.\nThis will likely run for a while.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nSenna's Lotus 'the most beautiful F1 livery'\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?",

But their sons were so far away in weight and experience that, on paper, they never should have shared a ring.\nThe smaller Benn had operated most of his career at welterweight, whereas former world-title challenger Eubank was a seasoned pro up at middleweight and super-middleweight.\nSuch was the demand for the match-up, though, a carefully constructed environment was created to make the fight make sense. This is not uncommon in the world of boxing, see Jake Paul v Mike Tyson for further reference.\nA rehydration clause limited Eubank from adding more than 10lb on the morning of fight night.\nBenn was approved to use firmer horsehair gloves instead of foam padding and an 18ft ring was used instead of the standard 20ft - both of which suited his explosive style.\nEubank was a fighter who, at the back end of his career, struggled to make the 11st 6lb weight limit.\nThe clip of him in a sweatsuit - in discomfort and pain - trying to shed whatever fat was left on his body was a sorry sight for the sport.\nBut promoter Hearn feels too much was made of Eubank's weight cut.\n\"He has made it the last five times but he just messed up, that's it,\" Hearn said at the post-fight news conference.\n\"Apart from his dad, no-one ever said 'do you think it's dangerous for Benn to be moving up two divisions and fighting someone the size of Eubank?'\"\nBut regardless of whether you feel Benn or Eubank was at the bigger disadvantage, if so many conditions needed to be met to create a level playing field, should they have been fighting each other in the first place?\nEubank appeared affected by the weight cut during the fight and struggled to keep pace with Benn early on\nBenn, who denies intentional doping and was cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, may never win over the critics - those who feel there are still unanswered questions about the failed tests.\nYet some boxing fans - not necessarily the purists - can be forgiving, especially when you put it all on the line. Judging by the jeers turned into cheers, Benn left north London having converted a few haters into fans.\nHe came close to causing the upset. There is some merit to him saying he could have beaten Eubank had he been more active. Benn has missed out on key learning years and fights over the past two and half years.\nSo where does he go from here?\n\"If it was as close as people are saying it is, then that's what is painful because I wasn't outclassed or hurt in there,\" Ben said.\n\"Do I avenge the loss, or drop down [to welterweight] and win the WBC world title? If [Mario] Barrios is watching, I'd love that.\"\nEubank has gone some way in transforming his public image in the build-up.\nHis emotional vulnerability in opening up about his fractured relationship with his father and the death of his brother in 2021 has softened his 'bad guy' persona.\nEubank has also won over some of his peers, too. He took a hit from his own pocket to compensate those fighters who were supposed to feature on the undercard of his cancelled 2022 fight with Benn.\nIt was a shrewd PR move from Eubank but also highlighted the disparity between main eventers and those who are not earning life-changing money.\nBut for all his good deeds, Eubank had to perform on the night. It was tougher than expected, but he did enough.\nHe has been linked to a bout with Mexican superstar Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in 2026. There will be an easier route to a world title, should he wish.\nWhichever direction Eubank and Benn go in now, we must keep in mind how and why we got here.\nWithout the monocle-wearing, truck-driving Eubank Sr and British Army soldier turned Dark Destroyer Nigel Benn, there would be no 65,000 fans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nWhile Eubank Jr and Benn have carved out their own careers, they are also two fighters reaping the rich fruits of nepotism.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

His arrival for his son's bout with Conor Benn on Saturday night was a scene worthy of any soap opera plot twist.In a sport of fine margins, the reconciliation may just have given his son, Chris Eubank Jr - who said before the fight he had not spoken to his father for years - the edge over Conor Benn in a rivalry steeped in history and drama.After 12 gruelling back-and-forth rounds at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the usually composed Eubank fell to his knees when his name was read out as the winner.Benn welled up, tears masked by a stone-faced expression as he battled the disappointment.Anyone who has even loosely followed boxing these past two years will be acutely aware how badly both men wanted the win.It all began with a clash of personalities and a bloodline feud inherited from their fathers' iconic duel in the 1990s.The rivalry was blasted to heights higher than Katy Perry's recent brief space jaunt after Benn failed a drugs test, which led to the cancellation of their scheduled 2022 bout.And it ended with both men, rather fittingly, in the arms of their legendary fathers.As an emotional Benn took his defeat with humility, he also struck at what has been at the heart of a fight that captivated a nation. \"A relationship with your father is special, I'd pick a relationship with my dad over boxing any day,\" Benn said.",

        "article_text": "River's Franco Mastantuono and Boca's Edinson Cavani will likely play key roles on Sunday\nWhen it comes to football derbies, very little comes close to matching the passion, intensity and cultural significance of Argentina's Superclasico between River Plate and Boca Juniors.\nSuperstar players, fanatical fans, regular helpings of drama and the sinister side of the game - the Superclasico has it all.\nOn Sunday, River's 85,000-capacity Mas Monumental stadium will host the 264th Superclasico on matchday 15 of the Torneo Apertura, the first half of the Argentine top-flight season. \nBoca are looking to avenge a 1-0 home defeat in September and clinch top spot in Apertura Zone A, while River need to build momentum before the knockout rounds after a mixed start to the season.\nWhatever the outcome, it promises to be some spectacle.\nNot only are River and Boca local rivals in Buenos Aires, they are the two biggest clubs in Argentina and indeed two of the superpowers in South America. As many as 80% of Argentines support one of the two clubs.\nTheir trophy cabinets match their popularity.\nRiver have 38 top-flight titles and four Copas Libertadores to their name, while Boca have won the league title on 35 occasions and the Libertadores on six, with three of those triumphs coming during a golden age between 2000 and 2003.\nBoth have also counted some of the greatest players of all time among their ranks. \nRiver alumni include Alfredo di Stefano, Enzo Francescoli and Daniel Passarella, while Boca fans have worshipped Carlos Tevez, Juan Roman Riquelme and Diego Maradona.\nThere is naturally a lot at stake on derby day - Boca fans take great pride in the fact they lead River 92 wins to 87 in the overall Superclasico record. But the rivalry goes way beyond 90 minutes on a football pitch.\n\"It is rooted in their origins, or rather their respective foundational myths,\" Argentine football journalist Santi Bauza tells BBC Sport.\nThe close geographical proximity of the clubs when they were founded - River in 1901 and Boca four years later - created tension.\nOne fan is said to have burned the flag of the opposition during one early meeting, while a Superclasico in 1931 was abandoned after 31 minutes because of mass fighting.\nThe schism widened when River Plate - after joining their rivals in the working-class neighbourhood of La Boca - relocated to the well-to-do suburb of Recoleta up the road, then further north to Nunez, where they reside today.\nDeserting their working-class home and spending big on players - the 35,000 pesos (\u00a31,350) fee paid for Bernabe Ferreyra in 1932 set an Argentine transfer record that stood for 20 years - led to River becoming known as 'Los Millonarios'. The Millionaires.\nBy contrast, Boca have always remained in their spiritual home, the famous La Bombonera stadium that is seemingly dropped into the middle of the 'barrio', a high-poverty district of the city.\nTheir Italian immigrant, working-class roots are a central part of their identity. Little shows this more than the club's nickname 'Xeneize', which comes from the Ligurian dialect word for Genoese.\nA Superclasico without some sort of scuffle does not feel like a Superclasico\nThe division between the clubs is reflected on the pitch in both playing styles and full-blooded encounters.\n\"River have traditionally favoured a more aesthetic brand of football, with their more demanding fans barely even celebrating hard-fought or undeserved wins,\" explains Bauza. \nRiver fans often speak of the three Gs - Gustar (to play well), Ganar (to win) and Golear (to score lots of goals).\n\"Our club is known for its beautiful style of play, excellent ball control, an attacking mindset, and a philosophy that sees attacking the opposition's goal as the best form of defence,\" River club president Jorge Brito tells BBC Sport.\nThat mentality is juxtaposed by the popular Boca motto 'transpira a la camiseta', which means to 'make the shirt sweat'. Passion and fight are non-negotiable.\n\"Boca pride themselves in being a win-at-all-costs kind of side,\" says Bauza.\n\"Over the years they have both become so massive and ubiquitous in Argentine society that the rich-poor narrative doesn't hold up as much now, but they are still largely identified by those footballing philosophies.\"\nInsult culture in Argentina has given rise to some incredibly petty nicknames.\nSince throwing away a half-time lead to lose to Penarol in the 1966 Copa Libertadores final, Boca fans have called River 'Gallinas' - 'little chickens'.\nIn a 2004 Superclasico, Boca striker Carlos Tevez was sent off for performing a chicken dance in celebration.\nBoca are known as 'Los Bosteros' - 'the manure handlers' - as a factory that used horse manure to make bricks once stood behind La Bombonera. Opposition players have been known to hold their noses when entering the pitch.\nBoca's La Bombonera stadium often shakes during matches\nArgentina is obsessed with football, so it is no surprise that meetings between its two biggest clubs are seismic events.\n\"The Superclasico stops the country in its tracks,\" says Bauza.\n\"Regardless of their form or success, it's always a game that defines the mood of players, managers, pundits and fans alike.\n\"Storylines can emerge or change overnight depending on what happens.\"\nOne of the main highlights of the Superclasico is actually what happens in the stands rather than on the pitch.\nGiant tifos and choreographed displays are common, singing is non-stop and the atmosphere is spine-tingling.\nBut there is a dark side to the world's most intense derby.\nThe Barras Brava - a gang-like organised fan group - rule the terraces in Argentina and have huge influence over club issues like ticketing, merchandising and car parking.\nRiver Plate's Mas Monumental stadium can accommodate 85,000 people after expansion\nAlthough they bring the noise and passion that makes Argentine football so special, their intrinsic links to organised crime, violence and homicide can make stadiums dangerous places.\nWhen River were relegated to the second division in 2011 for the first time in their history, the players were locked inside the dressing room for three hours while fans rioted and burned parts of El Monumental.\nIn 2015 Boca were thrown out of the Libertadores when the River squad were sprayed with pepper spray when emerging for the second half.\nThe second leg of the 2018 Libertadores final - the highest-profile game in Superclasico history - was postponed after police tear gas, used to disperse River fans who had smashed windows on the Boca bus with projectiles as it sped towards Mas Monumental, affected the visiting players.\nThe competition - named after those who liberated South America from Spanish rule - was concluded in Madrid.\nWhile River are assured of a place in the last 16 of the Apertura and top their Libertadores group, a mixture of pre-season squad upheaval and injuries have contributed to an inconsistent start to the year.\nBut beat Boca on Sunday and everything will look a lot rosier.\n\"It is always special. This game is the one you wait for, and nothing else matters when it comes to how it feels to win or lose against them,\" says journalist and River fan Andres Bruckner.\nWhile Boca have had a week to prepare, River flew more than six hours to Ecuador for a 2-2 draw with Independiente del Valle in the Libertadores on Wednesday.\n\"I always think we will win, but playing Libertadores midweek makes things tricky,\" says Bruckner.\n\"In moments like these, with so many doubts, a defeat would put a great question mark over all the players, and supporters will show anger.\"\nWith 85,000 fans now able to cram into the recently expanded Mas Monumental, the pressure to win has never been greater.\n\"I wouldn't mind losing five games in a row if we get the win on Sunday,\" admits broadcaster and River fan Juan Igal. \n\"Boca is the thing I hate the most, and seeing the sadness in their fans and players makes me happy.\"\nRiver Plate won the most recent Superclasico, a 1-0 victory at Boca's La Bombonera in September\nWith many of the players responsible for River's success in recent years now moved on - the sales of Julian Alvarez and Claudio Echeverri to Manchester City typify the struggle of Argentine clubs to retain their best young talent - manager Marcelo Gallardo has placed a lot of faith in 17-year-old starlet Franco Mastantuono.\nBoca started the season poorly - they won just one of their opening four Apertura games and were eliminated in the Libertadores qualifiers - but nine wins in their last 10 league games have sent them three points clear at the top of the table.\nCarlos Palacios and Kevin Zenon have stood out for Boca this season, while the likes of Edinson Cavani and Luis Advincula provide experience and relative calm.\n\"Boca fans die for every game, but we live for Copa Libertadores nights and Superclasicos. It's a game unlike any other,\" says Rodrigo Azurmendi, Boca fan and co-host of the Boca in English Podcast.\n\"Winning means going all out on the jokes, the memes and the folklore against our friends on the other side. Losing means skipping work on Monday.\"\nFor some, the idea of defeat on Sunday is too much to bear. \n\"I can't think about losing, I just don't have it in me,\" Boca fan Rob Smith says.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

America's trade deficit with Canada - expected to be $45bn in 2024 - was mostly driven by US energy demands.\nCanada and US relations have been strained in recent months, driven by Trump's talk of a \"51st state\" and referring to previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\" - the title for leaders of individual American states.\nThe US president has also sparked a global trade war in which Canada was one of the first countries targeted with tariffs.\nTrump has partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on various Canadian goods, along with 25% import taxes on all aluminium and steel imports, but has exempted products covered by a US, Canada and Mexico trade deal known as USMCA.\nCanada has retaliated with some C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) worth of tariffs on US goods.\nCarney said talks with Trump would be \"on our terms, not on their terms\".\n\"There is a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership,\" he said.\n\"It's going to be a very different one than we've had in the past.\"\nCarney has touted his experience handling global economic crises as a way to deal with Trump on tariffs.\nBefore becoming PM in early March, Carney had never held political office. \nHe is a banker by trade, leading the Bank of Canada during the 2008 global financial crisis before becoming the first non-British person to take on the top job at the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020.\nThe PM said Canada was the \"biggest client for more than 40 states\" in the US.\n\"Remember that we supply them [the US] with vital energy. Remember that we supply their farmers with basically all their fertiliser,\" Carney told the BBC.\n\"We deserve respect. We expect respect and I'm sure we'll get it in due course again, and then we can have these discussions.\"\nCanada and the US, along with Mexico, have deeply integrated economies, with billions of pounds worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders on a daily basis, for example, car parts.\nThe introduction of tariffs, which are taxes levied on goods as they enter a country and paid for by the importer, threatens decades of collaborations between the nations.\nTrump has argued tariffs will encourage more Americans to buy domestically-made goods, which will ultimately boost US manufacturing and jobs. \nWhile America's main opponent in the global trade conflict is China, the introduction of Trump's blanket, so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the likes of the UK and other European countries has led to allies seeking fresh agreements in response to barriers to trading with the world's largest economy.\nCarney, who endorsed UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the British general election, said \"one would think\" that Canada and the UK could sign a stalled free trade agreement as part of diversifying trade, but highlighted about 95% of trade between the countries is effectively tariff-free already.\n\"We could expand the level of integration between our countries, like-minded countries. You think about defence partnerships, and those conversations have just just begun, so there's a lot that we can do,\" he added.\nIn a statement congratulating Carney, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"I know we will continue to work closely on defence, security, trade and investment.\"\nCarney said the G7 summit hosted by Canada in June would be \"very important\" in deciding the future path of the global trade war, adding it would \"put to the test\" whether the group of the world's seven most advanced economies - which includes the US - was still the most \"like-minded of like-minded countries\".\nThe summit will occur just before the 90-day pause on some of Trump's higher tariffs is set to expire.",

        "article_text": "Over the past week I have crossed a radically changing North America, from Arizona to Washington DC in the US and then on to Saskatchewan in Canada, witnessing clear evidence of the consequences of historic change in the way the world economy is run. Huge uncertainty means nobody really knows where it is headed.\nThe walk from the White House Rose Garden to the HQ of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes just 9 minutes. In the past few days, in this very short stroll, two very different worlds collided with each other.\nThe former is the place where at the start of this month, with an extraordinary chart and questionable equation, President Trump took on the world with his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\".\nThe latter is the place where just three weeks on from that, after rowback, market tumult, and confusion, the finance ministers of the entire world gathered to try to pick up the pieces, even as they were still rebounding off the ground.\nAt the IMF meetings that included gatherings of G7 and G20 members, something unique happened. The US representatives faced not open hostility, but exasperation, bewilderment and deep concern, from almost the entire rest of the world, for having sent the global economy back towards a crisis, just as it had finally emerged from four years of pandemic, war and energy shocks.\nThe concern was most acutely expressed by the East Asian countries, who had in early April been classed as \"looters and pillagers\" of American jobs because of the fact that these economies, many of them key allies of the US, export more goods to the US than the other way around.\nThe talk of the G7 was the quiet determined fury of the Japanese, who were said to feel betrayed by the US turn on trade, and whose confusion over what US trade negotiators actually wanted recently sparked a sell off of US government bonds. The finance minister Katsunobu Kato told the roundtable the US tariffs were \"highly disappointing\", hurting growth and destabilising markets.\nI was reminded of the time at the IMF in 2022 when developing country finance ministers asked me if everything was OK in Britain during the mini budget crisis of Liz Truss' government. Then the UK was the source of fragility, trading like an emerging market, when its normal role was solving crises in those markets.\nIn the face of febrile bond markets, this week the faint sound of the bugle of retreat on the US trade war got louder. A forest of olive branches seemed to be on offer from the US to get the Chinese to come back to the table to negotiate, from respect for their economic achievements to the offer of a deal to do a \"beautiful rebalancing\" of the world economy. It was a far cry from the claims of \"looting and pillaging\".\nYet a much hoped for meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart did not materialise.\nMost of the rest of the world leaving their meetings with Bessent are reporting back an assumption that the US is edging away from what it cannot acknowledge was overreach.\nAnd there is a widespread view that there is no need for countries to retaliate, when the CEOs of Walmart and Target are telling the President privately that there will be empty shelves from early May.\nThe collapse in container traffic from China to the port of Los Angeles - the main artery of the world economy for the first quarter of the 21st century - is the one to watch. The IMF's boffins say they can start to see the impact from space as satellites track fewer, increasingly empty ships leaving China's ports. Of course this will be denied by the US.\nIt is true that there was far more relative calm at the end of the IMF Meetings compared to the beginning. Why? Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world.\nFinancial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics.\nThe story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office.\nWall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President.\nAt best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and  currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs.\nAnd that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next.\nAt times of acute global financial stress, \"swap lines\" between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars.\nBut now some of the world's central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar \"swap lines\" to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon.\nIs it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible.\nA little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers.\nIn this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a \"whodunnit\" about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal.\nSome speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible.\nWhile Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that \"Investors need to know that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world\". If you have to say it\u2026\nAnother significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that \"no one was crawling to the Americans\" given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market.\nAmid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the \"baseline\" universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump's message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to \"completely eliminate\" income taxes for \"many people\" would rather suggest that it will stay.\n\"It depends on who you talk to on which day of week\u2026 I've heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,\" said one senior G7 official. \"Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,\" I was told.\nThis is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House's own creative definition of \"trade cheating\" - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly \"cheating\" the UK.\nI put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion.\nBut eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe.\nThat's because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a \"high ambition high alignment\" deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers.\nA very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and \"doing its homework\" as a response to US unreliability. \"Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,\" I was told privately.\nThere was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me. \nBessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win.\nBut a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain's booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year -  and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a \"frank\" discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo.\nHe appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: \"There's a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities\".\nSpain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn't like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month's tariff accusations and chaos.\nWhoever wins in Canada's election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump's 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own.\nThere is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

But their sons were so far away in weight and experience that, on paper, they never should have shared a ring.\nThe smaller Benn had operated most of his career at welterweight, whereas former world-title challenger Eubank was a seasoned pro up at middleweight and super-middleweight.\nSuch was the demand for the match-up, though, a carefully constructed environment was created to make the fight make sense. This is not uncommon in the world of boxing, see Jake Paul v Mike Tyson for further reference.\nA rehydration clause limited Eubank from adding more than 10lb on the morning of fight night.\nBenn was approved to use firmer horsehair gloves instead of foam padding and an 18ft ring was used instead of the standard 20ft - both of which suited his explosive style.\nEubank was a fighter who, at the back end of his career, struggled to make the 11st 6lb weight limit.\nThe clip of him in a sweatsuit - in discomfort and pain - trying to shed whatever fat was left on his body was a sorry sight for the sport.\nBut promoter Hearn feels too much was made of Eubank's weight cut.\n\"He has made it the last five times but he just messed up, that's it,\" Hearn said at the post-fight news conference.\n\"Apart from his dad, no-one ever said 'do you think it's dangerous for Benn to be moving up two divisions and fighting someone the size of Eubank?'\"\nBut regardless of whether you feel Benn or Eubank was at the bigger disadvantage, if so many conditions needed to be met to create a level playing field, should they have been fighting each other in the first place?\nEubank appeared affected by the weight cut during the fight and struggled to keep pace with Benn early on\nBenn, who denies intentional doping and was cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, may never win over the critics - those who feel there are still unanswered questions about the failed tests.\nYet some boxing fans - not necessarily the purists - can be forgiving, especially when you put it all on the line. Judging by the jeers turned into cheers, Benn left north London having converted a few haters into fans.\nHe came close to causing the upset. There is some merit to him saying he could have beaten Eubank had he been more active. Benn has missed out on key learning years and fights over the past two and half years.\nSo where does he go from here?\n\"If it was as close as people are saying it is, then that's what is painful because I wasn't outclassed or hurt in there,\" Ben said.\n\"Do I avenge the loss, or drop down [to welterweight] and win the WBC world title? If [Mario] Barrios is watching, I'd love that.\"\nEubank has gone some way in transforming his public image in the build-up.\nHis emotional vulnerability in opening up about his fractured relationship with his father and the death of his brother in 2021 has softened his 'bad guy' persona.\nEubank has also won over some of his peers, too. He took a hit from his own pocket to compensate those fighters who were supposed to feature on the undercard of his cancelled 2022 fight with Benn.\nIt was a shrewd PR move from Eubank but also highlighted the disparity between main eventers and those who are not earning life-changing money.\nBut for all his good deeds, Eubank had to perform on the night. It was tougher than expected, but he did enough.\nHe has been linked to a bout with Mexican superstar Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in 2026. There will be an easier route to a world title, should he wish.\nWhichever direction Eubank and Benn go in now, we must keep in mind how and why we got here.\nWithout the monocle-wearing, truck-driving Eubank Sr and British Army soldier turned Dark Destroyer Nigel Benn, there would be no 65,000 fans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nWhile Eubank Jr and Benn have carved out their own careers, they are also two fighters reaping the rich fruits of nepotism.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Shahida's face crumpled with grief every time she thought about the choice in front of her: Stay for love or go back to her siblings?\nShahida Adrees, now 61, moved to India from Pakistan in 2002, when she married her maternal cousin Adrees Khan, a resident of Punjab state (marriage between cousins is practised in some communities in South Asia).\nThe couple lived a peaceful, predictable life - Khan working as a driver and Shahida looking after their home and child.\nEvery few years, Shahida, who is staying in India on a long-term visa, would obtain a travel permit and make a trip to Pakistan to meet her family.\nBut that sense of routine was shattered last week when India suspended almost all visas for Pakistani citizens as part of its response to the brutal attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people. Pakistan, which denies any involvement, has hit back with tit-for-tat measures and also cancelled most visas for Indians.\nWhen Shahida heard the news, she knew what it meant; she could either go back to her siblings and other family members in Pakistan now, or stay and risk never seeing them again.\nShe chose to stay. Earlier this week, she cancelled her plans of going to Pakistan to see an ailing aunt. \"If I had gone, I wouldn't have been let back into India. But now that I am here, I don't know if I'll ever see my brothers and sisters again,\" she says.\nShahida's family is among hundreds in India and Pakistan who, with members on both sides of the borders, now face the risk of separation.\nDespite neighbours India and Pakistan sharing a hostile relationship, love stories and marriages between its citizens are not uncommon. That's because of the deeply intertwined cultural history of the countries which were partitioned along religious lines in 1947, forcing millions to leave their homes and migrate to the other side.\nThe border between the nations runs not just through the ground, but also through families - many Indians have relatives and their hometowns in Pakistan, and vice versa.\nSome, like Shahida's family, have tried to stay in touch with their roots through marriages with relatives across the border. In recent years, many couples have also met online, often overcoming insurmountable odds to stay together. \nMany of them apply for long-term visas that need to be renewed periodically while others apply for citizenship of the respective countries - but the process can take years.\nThis week, as the visa restrictions took effect, heart-breaking visuals of people - young and old couples, desperate sons and daughters, and elderly parents - pleading with authorities for help were splashed across television screens and on social media.\nThe BBC has contacted the Indian foreign ministry for comment. \n\"I came here with my mother. Now they are asking us to leave without her. How can I do that?\" mumbled a tearful Mohammed Ayat, 17.\nA Pakistani national, Ayat came to India last month to meet his maternal relatives. His mother is an Indian citizen who was living in Pakistan on a visa that is pending renewal.\nBut even as her children returned to Pakistan, she had to stay in India as she wasn't sure whether she would be allowed into the country.\n\"They can punish them [the militants], but what is our fault?\" Ayat told ANI news agency.\nThe exact number of people leaving both countries due to the latest tensions is not clear - but is estimated to run into hundreds. \nSitting in a bus that was taking her to the Attari-Wagah border, Parveen (who uses only one name), told reporters that she had lived in India for 41 years.\n\"I have no mother, brothers or sisters in Pakistan. I have nowhere to go there. I am completely helpless,\" she said.\nFamilies say the abruptness of the visa suspensions and the resulting chaos have left them feeling uncertain.\nThe restrictions imposed by Delhi exempt those like Shahida, who have been living in India on a long-term visa which needs to be renewed every few years. Valid for up to five years, these visas are given to women of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationalities who are married to Indian citizens. \nUnder Indian rules, all long-term visa holders are allowed to visit their home country after obtaining a second permit, called the No Objection to Return to India (NORI) visa.\nBut in the days following the attack, there have been reports of NORI visa holders also being stopped from crossing the border into India, as officials waited for clarity.\nShahida says that in her case, Indian authorities have assured her that NORI visa-holders would be exempted from the restrictions. \nBut she is not willing to take the risk of leaving India.\nShe wondered if things would've been better if she had got an Indian citizenship.\n\"I did apply for it in 2009, but the file never moved. I never received a response,\" she said.\nFor Tahira Ahmed, even becoming an Indian citizen has not been enough to allay her anxieties. A Pakistani by birth, Ms Ahmed moved to Punjab state in 2003 after marrying Maqbool Ahmed, an Indian . In 2016, Tahira was granted Indian citizenship, 13 years after her marriage.\nBut she is still fearful about the prospect of being separated from her family and sent to Pakistan.\n\"Whenever tensions escalate between the two countries, our lives get caught up in the middle,\" she said. \"My own wedding was postponed for two years in 2001 when the border was closed after an attack on India's parliament.\"\nWhile they wait for answers, some couples are desperate.\nEarlier this week, BBC Punjabi met Maria Masih, a Pakistani citizen who moved to India in 2024 to marry her lover Sonu.\nThe two met through social media and knew each other for many years before they decided to get married. According to Sonu, the couple applied for a long-term visa for Maria immediately after their wedding. But their application is still under process. Maria is now seven months pregnant.\n\"I want to live here. I don't want to go back. Please give me a visa and let me stay,\" a forlorn Maria told reporters earlier this week.\nThe couple has since reportedly been absconding and an investigation is under way.\nMiles away, Ms Ahmed wonders if one can really blame them or anyone for trying to escape.\n\"What is their fault anyway? They came here for love,\" she said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

It also says it has 70 staff worldwide and operates from the UK, US and Canada. Mr Adler runs the company from Dubai.\nLeaked internal documents suggest ConvrtX billed more than $5m (\u00a33.8m) in sales to more than 280 customers between 2019 and 2023 alone, but senior insiders say there were few success stories.\nOur investigation found:\nIn response, Mr Adler's legal team say ConvrtX had only received about 12-15 complaints out of about 340 customers - adding that after the incident of the sexually inappropriate emails, the company immediately terminated its contract with the lawyer.\nAmy (not her real name), a 37-year-old single mother from the UK, says she was \"led down the garden path\" after paying $53,000 (\u00a340,000) in 2021 for a website and an app for her non-profit organisation, which aims to match people with fertility issues to potential surrogates.\nShe says she was strung along for two years, only ever receiving a basic website and no working app, while Mr Adler continued to ask for more funds.\nAmy was particularly annoyed by a text she says Mr Adler sent to her, featuring a picture of him celebrating New Year's Eve on a tropical beach in Bali.\n\"Why flaunt your money to me? It's disgraceful,\" says Amy, who had funded the project by remortgaging her home and using credit cards.\nEventually, she requested a refund through her bank and complained to the UK's Financial Ombudsman Service. A senior investigator there has provisionally recommended that the bank return $39,000 (\u00a330,000) to Amy, according to documents seen by the BBC. She is still waiting for her bank to agree to the recommendation.\nAs part of the process, two expert software developers reviewed the app developed by ConvrtX. According to the senior investigator, the evidence supported Amy's claim that the company had breached their contract by failing to provide the service she paid for.\n\"I think it's fair to say ConvrtX failed to exercise reasonable care and skill when they were providing the service,\" the investigator said. \"It seems the work completed by ConvrtX cannot be salvaged and the entire process would need to be completed again if [Amy] wanted a working app to be developed.\"\nIn response, lawyers for Mr Adler say that the client had \"received a website, clickable prototype and a fully developed mobile app from ConvrtX\".\nFormer senior staff say that Josh Adler - the son of Kerry Adler, a wealthy Canadian businessman - presided over a culture of instability, resulting in high turnover of staff and errors due to \"cutting corners\" and hiring and firing inexperienced contractors.\nOn his Facebook profile, Mr Adler described himself as #YoungAndReckless and #LivingTheDream. We spoke to a number of former employees who described him as immature and a poor leader.\nIn company meetings, they say he \"bragged\" about living at the Emirates Palace Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Abu Dhabi, boasted about renting a villa in Bali, and showed off a newly purchased Porsche 911 and multiple speeding fines.\nHe cared about \"his rich kid, bling-bling lifestyle,\" says a former senior employee speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"When you have that many unhappy clients, it can't be a coincidence.\"\nMr Adler's lawyers describe him as \"highly ambitious\" and say he sought to build a world-leading business, but that not all staff lived up to his high standards and would be \"let go\" if they under-delivered. \"Young and Reckless\" is a clothing brand he likes, they add.\nBut several senior ex-staff told us they had concerns about how Mr Adler ran his company, saying he continued to take on new clients even after being warned that some business and app ideas were unviable or impossible to make. They say he requested payments from clients in advance, sometimes as much as $53,000 (\u00a340,000), though the company had a no-refund policy.\nTwo senior ex-employees claim that when Mr Adler was informed that some apps were not working, he would subsequently tell customers - against the advice of the development team - that he could fix the problem if they paid more money, or their outstanding balance.\n\"So don't tell the client that it cannot be done because we'll find [a contractor] that can do it when they've paid,\" one ex-staff member recalls Mr Adler repeatedly telling them. \"He's a good talker, he's good at sales\u2026 but he gives a lot of false promises.\"\nA former customer, DeShawn Womack, says he felt \"lied to\" after he hired ConvrtX in 2021. He says he paid more than $50,000 (\u00a337,750) for a mobile app that would allow users to remotely access their phone and all its data from another device if it was lost, stolen or damaged.\nHe says he received a design prototype, but not a finished working app.\nAfter making payments over two years, Mr Womack - a truck driver from the US state of Georgia - messaged a senior ConvrtX employee for clarity about whether his app would be able to sync missed calls and voicemails. He also asked if it would allow users to make phone calls from a different device using their same number - a specific feature he said Mr Adler had told him was possible and was referenced in his contract with ConvrtX.\n\"This is impossible, your app was never ever possible in the first place,\" the employee responded in messages seen by the BBC. \"Did someone tell you this was possible?\"\nMr Womack replied: \"Yes, Josh [Adler] did and plus it's in my project sign-off.\" \nThe 40-year-old, who says he spent his life savings on the project, told the BBC he stopped making additional payments after he believed his app was not being properly worked on. \n\"He [Josh Adler] sold me a dream and this is frustrating,\" he says.\nLawyers for Mr Adler say he denies telling customers that their ideas were viable when they were not. They say ConvrtX was always clear about the difficulty of developing an app, but if the client wanted to proceed it would usually take on the project.\nGemma Martin from Dundee, who runs a tarot-card-reading business, says ConvrtX failed to deliver after she paid more than $35,000 (\u00a326,000) for services including a working interactive website and mobile app that would let users request readings and subscribe to her services.\nAfter she wrote negative reviews online, the 33-year-old says ConvrtX refused to release her website unless she signed a non-disclosure agreement stopping her from criticising the company - which she declined.\nIn emails seen by the BBC, a company lawyer then made sexually inappropriate remarks to Ms Martin while trying to resolve the dispute, writing that he had researched her online and her \"professional profile\" did not \"match [her] beauty\".\nLawyers for ConvrtX say the emails were sent by a part-time third-party contractor who was terminated immediately once Mr Adler, who also apologised to Ms Martin, learned of the incident.\nMs Martin says she received a business plan from ConvrtX and eventually raw source codes for her website and app, though she says these were unusable and incomplete.\nLawyers for ConvrtX say it delivered Ms Martin a fully developed mobile app and source code, despite her having failed to pay her remaining balance. The company has since taken legal action against her for defamation, which she is contesting.\nSteven Marshall, 53, says he was also threatened with legal action by ConvrtX when he asked for a full refund. He says he was \"thoroughly disappointed\" with work he had paid $5,183 (\u00a33,920) for to help launch his business supporting independent filmmakers.\nIn emails seen by the BBC, ConvrtX's compliance officer told Mr Marshall that if he publicly shared his \"baseless allegations\" it would be \"criminal and civil libel\" and the company would seek a \"criminal charge\" against him.\nThe compliance officer also said that Mr Marshall had \"signed away\" his right to post negative reviews online about ConvrtX because of a non-disclosure agreement signed prior to the work starting.\nOther former customers say they also faced threats - including Ayesha Imran, who told the BBC she had requested a refund of $18,000 (\u00a313,500) when she did not receive an app and a privacy policy for her website, after hiring ConvrtX in 2021.\nIn March 2023, she complained to Mr Adler for what she described as a breach of contract because of ConvrtX's failure to deliver.\nIn her complaint, she wrote she had been informed that Mr Adler was not paying his development team the appropriate amount for the work that needed to be done, causing several delays because of staff turnover, and resulting in insufficient product delivery.\nThe company's compliance officer responded that Ms Imran would face damages of at least $60,000 (\u00a347,000) if she publicly shared negative comments about ConvrtX or attempted to contact any of its employees. She says she viewed this as an attempt to intimidate and scare her.\nDespite her experience, Ms Imran was being featured - until last month - as a false testimonial on the company's website.\n\"ConvrtX has helped us go from vision, to launch and supported with everything in between. They are really quite holisitc [sic], in what they do!\" the post read.\n\"Those words never left my mouth,\" says Ms Imran, who tells us she had previously asked Mr Adler to remove it.\nAlongside Ms Imran's fake testimonial, the BBC has found that Mr Adler also used an image of Jen Selter, a lifestyle and fashion influencer with more than 13 million followers on social media. Ms Selter confirmed she had never used ConvrtX's services, and that the image had been used without her consent.\nMr Adler's lawyers say these testimonials were on a \"dummy site\" that was \"not intended by ConvrtX to be publicly available\".\nHowever, they were publicly available as recently as last month and some date back to August 2020, according to website archives and screengrabs taken by the BBC.\nEarlier this year, Mr Adler rebranded ConvrtX and, until being contacted by the BBC, was selling eight-week \"bootcamps\" for $159 (\u00a3124). In a promotional video, he claimed to have helped \"founders raise capital - six, eight, nine figures and the like\" and to have \"positively impacted 10,000 lives\".\nThe BBC wrote to Mr Adler asking what these numbers were based on, but his lawyers did not answer our question.\nIn a letter, lawyers for Josh Adler say he \"unequivocally\" denies the allegations. They say that Mr Adler and his business are the \"victims\" and that, until Gemma Martin made defamatory statements about it, ConvrtX had received very few, if any, complaints from its clients.\nAdditional reporting by William Dahlgreen and Tom Beal",

        "article_text": "When Donald Trump made a historic return to power earlier this year, it was with the help of voters who represented a diverse coalition of backgrounds - truck drivers, veterans, business owners and more.\nThey represented a wide range of perspectives that helped explain Trump's enduring appeal. But 100 days after he took office, how do his staunchest supporters feel now?\nThe BBC has returned to five of them. Here's what they had to say about the promises he kept, the pledges he has yet to address, and what they want next. \nLuiz Oliveira says he \"can't keep up\" with the rapid policy changes Trump has made in his first 100 days.\nOn immigration, he has appreciated the flurry of new border restrictions and the emphasis on deportations, including sending men to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. Encounters between migrants and US border agents at the US-Mexico are now at a four-year low.\nThe issue is important to Luiz, a Brazilian who came to the US legally in the 1980s and now lives in Nevada. Echoing Trump, he describes the influx of migrants in recent years as an \"invasion\".\nLuiz, 65, says Trump is telling undocumented immigrants: \"This is my house, my yard, and you're not going to stay here.\"\nIn other areas, however, he, is nervous about Trump's approach.\nThe coffee shop owner supports Trump's efforts to make other countries pay \"their fair share\" through tariffs. But he's apprehensive about the short-term economic effects as well as how long it could take for America to see the benefits. \n\"It's going to be painful [and] I don't think it's going to be as fast as he says.\n\"I'm a supporter, but at the end of the day, if this doesn't work, I'll say it's a mistake - he did things too fast, scared the markets, scared the economy.\"\nAmanda Sue Mathis backed Trump in 2024 because she felt he was the best candidate to address America's most pressing problems - 100 days in, she says he's made strong progress.    \n\"There were a lot of people who cared about the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, but I think it's time we look at our country and get things in order before we go fix other countries' problems,\" the 34-year-old Navy veteran says.\nShe wants a \"merit-based society\" and praises Trump's rollback of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies which had tried to boost minority representation and tackle discrimination. Critics say those policies are themselves discriminatory - and Amanda Sue believes they went too far in recent years.  \nShe also welcomes Trump's executive orders restricting gender care for Americans under the age of 19 and banning transgender women from female sports.\nBroadly, she thinks the president is \"kicking butt\" and his first 100 days have made her \"happier with [her] vote\". \nBut Amanda Sue is prepared to have her mind changed too.\n\"I'm not one of those people who is always for Trump,\" she says. \"If he messes up, I'll be the first one to tell you.\"\nTrump's promise to impose tariffs and bring manufacturing jobs back to America was a key reason why Ben Maurer, a 39-year-old freight truck driver from Pennsylvania, voted for the president. \n\"A lot of people thought he was bluffing on more than a few things,\" he says.\nSo Ben's delighted Trump hit the gas immediately, imposing tariffs on countries that range from allies like Canada and Mexico to adversaries like China. \nIt has not been a smooth ride, however. In a tumultuous series of announcements, the administration has raised, lowered, delayed and retracted tariffs in response to ongoing trade negotiations and stock market reaction. \nCurrently, the US has imposed a 10% tariffs on all imports - and China has been hit with a 145% tax on goods it exports to America. \nDespite economists' concerns about higher prices, Ben believes the businesses he delivers to will benefit in the long run.\n\"Trump has earned back the respect [for the US],\" he says of the president's tariff policies. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"\nOverall, he feels Trump has been more productive at the start of his second term. The president had time to prepare, he says, and it shows.\nJune Carey's opinion of Donald Trump has not changed, but the first few months of Trump's second term are not what she anticipated either.\n\"He's a bit more aggressive and a little bit more erratic than I expected,\" the California artist says.\nBut June, 70, doesn't see the surprises as negative. She is \"blown away\" by the \"waste\" the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk - says it has found. \nCritics say his claims about savings appear to be inflated and he has faced a backlash for blunt cuts at government departments that were later reversed, including firings of key federal workers. \nJune says she's uncertain about Musk himself.\n\"Musk is a character I don't understand,\" June says. \"My feeling is that if Trump has trusted him as much as he has, than he must be a pretty good guy with the right ideas and the right goals.\"\nShe previously told the BBC she was concerned about welfare spending and hoped Trump would push Americans to be more self-sufficient. While she is happy with the cuts so far, she hopes they leave alone social security - the monthly government payments that she and 67 million retired or disabled Americans live off.\nDemocrats warn those are at risk in future, but June asks: \"Why would they cut [social security] when they've cut so many things that have saved them millions and millions of dollars?\"\nJeremy Stevens has faithfully stood by Trump for years.\n\"[Trump is] very aggressively getting things he promised on the campaign trail done,\" he says.\nAt his automotive repair and used car shop in Maine, Jeremy sees some customers who feel differently about Trump's economic efforts. But the 45-year-old believes their nerves around tariffs in particular come from \"a lack of understanding\".\nThe tariffs are part of a Trump administration vision that Jeremy believes will pay off in the long run - if critics can hold on until then.\n\"There definitely is a perception out there about the impact of these policies that is short-sighted,\" he says.\nTrump's back-and-forth shift on tariff policies have come at a price, economists say. Markets around the world were sent spiralling. The International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty, with the US hardest hit. It warned there is a 40% chance of a recession in the US. \nBut Jeremy is convinced time will prove Trump right. \n\"It's a temporary pain,\" he says. \"This too shall pass.\"\nSend us your questions",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election \u2013 and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump.\nThe US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party.\nCarney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"\nUntil Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau.\nThe past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.\nThis Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.\nHe ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.\nNo one should expect those Liberals to say thank you to the American leader, however \u2013 or for Trump to soften his rhetoric, even though last month he said he preferred a Liberal prime minister. (He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)\nInstead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.\nThe irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney. \nWhile Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.\nA Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.\n\nAlthough Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge. \nAlready there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.\nCarney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.\nThe Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.\nMeanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.\nCarney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour.

While Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.A Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. )Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",

        "article_text": "Famous for its adorable quokkas, Rottnest Island has become a global favourite. But beyond the selfies lies a rich, complex story of culture, conservation and community.\nOn a recent visit to Perth, I mentioned to a local that I was heading to Rottnest Island the next day. She sighed wistfully. \"I love it there,\" she said. \"You're going to love it too. It has a special kind of magic \u2013 the kind of place where you kick off your shoes the minute you arrive. Everything slows down and you can breathe a little more deeply.\"\nI already felt that Perth was a little like that \u2013 at least, life there felt slower and less frenzied than in my hometown of Melbourne on Australia's east coast \u2013 but I smiled back, not really knowing what she meant.\nHowever, she was right. Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-sq-km isle off the coast of Western Australia, is, in fact, magical. The spell was cast as soon as our ferry left the mainland, skimming over the Indian Ocean. Humpback whales breached nearby, sending jets of sea spray into the air and flipping their tails as if in welcome. The sky was clear with the promise of a perfect day to come.\nJust 19km and 30 minutes later, I stepped off the ferry into another world. Rottnest Island has been famously car-free since 1931, and those more in the know than me immediately jumped onto bikes they'd brought with them or wandered off to hire one from Pedal and Flipper, said to be the largest bike hire place in the southern hemisphere.\nKids zoomed around in packs, dodging groups of tourists ambling through the main settlement. Some people had fishing rods under one arm; others, surfboards strapped to their bikes. Families stopped at the bakery for a flat white and vanilla slice before heading off to explore the island's 63 beaches and 20 bays, many with evocative names like Little Parakeet Bay and Cathedral Rocks that in no way came close to capturing the grandeur of the scenery in real life.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThere was no urban noise, no traffic and nothing to worry about. It was idyllic and glorious and everything I imagined a nostalgic care-free (and car-free) island holiday to be.\nThe isle has long been a cherished playground for generations of Western Australian families. \"Rottnest is very, very special, particularly to the people of Perth, like me,\" explained Paul Campbell, a volunteer guide I met not long after I arrived. Campbell spent his childhood holidays on Rottnest and now returns regularly to tell people about his beloved island. \"There are no multi-storey high-rise hotels here,\" he added. \"There is no private ownership. If you ever tried to put a multi-storey-anything here for wealthy people, you would be absolutely torn to shreds. We are very protective of our beautiful island.\"\nOnce a well-kept secret from the rest of the world, in recent years Rottnest has become one of Australia's most Instagrammed destinations, thanks to a certain fuzzy-faced resident: the quokka.\nIn 2013, Huffington Post dubbed the quokka \"the happiest animal in the world\", and the internet responded in glee. Quokkas \u2013 tiny marsupials found only in this small pocket of south-western Australia \u2013 seem to smile for selfies in a way that feels almost staged. Tennis star Roger Federer to actress Margot Robbie were among the first celebrities to pose with the infamous animal, helping spark a wave of global attention. Then in 2019 came Chris Hemsworth's now-iconic #QuokkaSelfie\u00a0with Matt Damon, which racked up more than four million likes. \"Rotto\", as locals call it, became the hottest ticket in town, transforming from local secret to global sensation. According to the Rottnest Island Authority, annual visitor numbers have nearly tripled in the last decade, peaking at more than 800,000 at last count.\nWhat's in a name?\nThe island was first sighted by Dutch explorers in the 17th Century and was named by one such captain, Wallem de Vlamingh, who stayed on the island for six days and mistook the quokkas for rats. He referred the island as \"'t elyandt 't rottenest\" which means \"rat's nest island\" in Dutch \u2013 although by all accounts he was also captivated by the pristine scenery and referred to it as \"paradise on Earth\" in his journal.\nRottnest, once simple and sleepy, has had to quickly grow up to meet the demands of all these domestic and international tourists. That meant creating more accommodation than the basic cabins and camping that existed, as well as better food and activity options. And what it has done is exemplary, transforming into a model of eco-conscious tourism without losing its soul.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Campbell put it: \"When I was nine years old, the [cultural] experience that I had on Rottnest is not that much different to what you're going to experience today.\"\u00a0\nYou won't find any private cars here \u2013 just a few vehicles for rangers and staff \u2013\u00a0so most everyone gets about on two wheels or two feet (or the odd skateboard, scooter or Segway), having to occasionally dodge quokkas lounging on the road. Accommodation ranges from beachside cottages with bike racks out front to backpacker dorms to relaxed boutique hotels. While many tourists come on a day trip from Perth, it's much better to stay the night: quokkas are nocturnal and will spend most of the day sleeping under shady bushes. In addition, most day-trippers leave by 16:30, at which point the island truly comes into its own.\n\"Someone once said to me that you can feel the island exhale [when they leave],\" said Erin Gallagher from the Rottnest Island Authority. \"I just thought it was the most beautiful thing \u2013 and it's so true.\"\nI was staying at Discovery Resorts, the island's first eco resort, whose 83 glamping tents are shaded by gum trees and Aleppo pines, tucked behind Pinky Beach in the sand dunes. My tent had no aircon or TV, just a ceiling fan for airflow and the sound of the ocean through canvas walls. It was perfect in its simplicity. \"[The resort] is designed to immerse guests into the environment,\" explained Krizza Miclat, the resort's sales and event manager. \"A lot of the infrastructure is elevated on steel poles to ensure that we're not damaging the sand dunes. So, if ever we were to pick up and move, we haven't impacted it too much.\"\nIn fact, nearly everything here works in harmony with the natural environment. Renewable energy is provided by the Indian Ocean's sea breezes and the strong Western Australian sun; while drinking water is drawn from the sweeping white semi-circle of\u00a0Longreach Bay, desalinated and filtered. Marine sanctuary zones below water mean world-class snorkelling and diving, and an island nursery grows native plants from locally sourced cuttings and seeds. In 2023, a new management plan reaffirmed Rottnest's commitment to sustainability, conservation and culture.\u00a0\n\"We're always striving to improve,\" said Gallagher. \"Our target is to achieve 75% renewables. There's even an app where anyone can see how much power the island is generating in real time.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A day out with Bluey: Australia's new experience brings the Heeler family to life\n\u2022 Bindi Irwin's top outdoor adventures in Australia\n\u2022 The hike making Australia a better place \nIn the spirit of low-impact activities, I decided to take a Segway tour around the undulating landscape, rolling along the endless beaches, gliding past the cluster of salt lakes in the north-eastern corner and looking out for whales on the island's Humpback Highway. I steered past the scrub heath that covers much of the island, breathing in its signature salty-sweet smell and dodging prickle lily and feather speargrass. The island is just 11km long and 4.5km at its widest point, but its biodiversity is vast \u2013 a Class A reserve where everything from the blue-flowered Rottnest daisy to the long, black king skink I saw on the side of a trail is protected.\nBut not all scenes here are so idyllic.\nIn 1838, Rottnest was turned into an Aboriginal prison. Over the next century, more than 4,000 Indigenous men and boys were incarcerated here for \"crimes\" that they often didn't know they'd committed. Some were as young as eight years old. Many never returned home.\nPlan your trip:\nGet there: Regular ferries are operated by Sealink and Rottnest Express (leaving from Perth CBD and Fremantle) and Rottnest Fast Ferries (leaving from Hillarys Boat Harbour, north of Perth CBD).\nWhen to go: Summer (December-February)\u00a0is the most popular (and crowded) time, but September-April is still warm enough for water-based activities. If you want to celebrate quokka joeys taking their first hops, visit 21-22 September 2025 for Little Quokka's Big Birthday Weekend.\nWhere to stay: Book an eco-glamping tent at Discovery Resorts or stay at the newly opened The Lodge Wadjemup.\nEat: Frankies for pizzas and salads; Sunset snacks and drinks at Pinky's; The Lane for craydogs (a spicy crayfish-stuffed roll); Isola for more upmarket fare.\nDo: Hire a bike, snorkel and mask from Pedal and Flipper to explore the island at your own pace. Head to Garden Lake at sunset for epic quokka sightings. Take a guided Segway tour to learn about the island's history as you explore.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's a dark legacy that the island is only beginning to address. As I wobbled my Segway back to the main settlement, we passed what looked like an ordinary field. But, my tour guide explained, it is a place of immense significance: the\u00a0Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground\u00a0where 373 unmarked graves of prisoners were uncovered, with the first discoveries made during construction work in the 1970s. Shockingly, holidaymakers continued to camp on the site until the practice was finally banned in 2007.\n\"It was the largest number of Aboriginal deaths in custody in history in Australia,\" explained volunteer guide Anne Yardley, when I met her later at the island's Wadjemup Museum. \"And from the biggest number of Aboriginal nations.\"\nBut Indigenous connection to the island stretches far beyond this painful chapter. Long before European settlement, the island was part of the mainland, and archaeological evidence shows that the Noongar people lived on and used the island for tens of thousands of years. Its Indigenous name \u2013 Wadjemup \u2013 means \"place of spirits\".\n\"This was a significant place for Indigenous people,\" Campbell told me. \"Ceremonies were held here. But about 6,500 years ago, sea levels rose and this patch of land became an island. The Aboriginal people stayed on the mainland and it was left alone for thousands of years\u2026 all through Christianity, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire\u2026 until Europeans arrived.\"\nToday, Wadjemup is working to tell this fuller story. The small but compelling Wadjemup Museum has been revamped; while walking trails such as the 45km\u00a0Wadjemup Bidi\u00a0\u2013 made up of five connected trails and built in part by volunteers \u2013 connects visitors to historical and cultural sites across the landscape, with interpretive signage and installations by Noongar artists. The\u00a0Wadjemup Project, an Aboriginal-led initiative, focusses on acknowledging Wadjemup's history of Aboriginal incarceration and the memorialisation of former prison sites.\nVolunteers play a huge part, too, from the Winnit Club, formed in 1931 by a group of regular campers, to the yellow-shirted Rottnest Volunteer Guides. These and other groups collectively contribute more than 40,000 hours a year to maintaining the island, and their dedication to preserving and sharing its stories speaks volumes about how deeply the island is loved.\n\"There's this balancing act between having enough people to make the place work financially, but not so many people coming here that you lose the reason to come,\" said Campbell. \"It is a very, very special place.\"\u00a0\nI certainly felt that on my visit. One moment I was riding my bike past salt lakes ringed with grey saltbush and coastal pigface, the next watching irresistibly cute quokkas hop around at sunset. I snorkelled an underwater trail through turquoise shallows, gazed onto shipwrecks just offshore and had sunset drinks looking out to incredible ocean vistas. I even tried to get my own quokka selfie, respecting the signs not to feed or touch them in any way but to keep my distance and let them come to me. I laughed as I tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to get both myself and a quokka fully in shot, and was reminded of something Gallagher had said to me about the smiling-faced marsupial: \"Why wouldn't you be happy if this is where you lived?\"\nIt was more than just a line \u2013 it was a truth that settled into the bones of the island. Rottnest may be famous now, but it hasn't lost what makes it feel like a local secret: the sense that once you arrive, you can slow down, breathe deeply and kick off your shoes for a while.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "BBC's North America team asked for your questions to mark US President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.\nHere is a selection of those answered by our staff writers and correspondents.  \nThey have aimed to explain the context and facts behind several of the biggest topics in the Trump administration, including the economy and how Trump would handle a war.\nA UK-based reader asks how the UK economy might be impacted by tariffs.\nThe decisions made thousands of miles away will affect the UK economy. Most directly affected are those exporters selling into America, contending with that 10% extra charge (or even more in some cases) being applied to their goods: Do they try to compensate for that by cutting costs elsewhere \u2013 or risk a blow to sales?\nAnd complex supply chains mean that disruption to other economies could be felt here. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey last week referred to a \"growth shock\" \u2013 many economists have cut their forecasts. No one yet is clear on how this trade war will play out, the uncertainty itself is damaging.\nBut the impact on inflation could work the other way. Countries such as China may be tempted to divert goods here instead, given the barriers they face in America. And the drop in oil and other commodity prices, amid market turmoil, could also bode well for keeping bills down.\nSo many economists reckon that with a weaker growth and inflation outlook, interest rates could fall faster than previously thought. A cut of 0.25 percentage points is widely expected next week, another could follow in June.\nAnother reader asks how Trump's immigration policy is likely to affect Canadian-American relations, especially for dual citizens or people with mixed-status families.\nIf the first 100 days are anything to go by, relations between Canada and the US are almost certainly going to continue to be tense - both as a result of tariffs and Trump's repeated, and near constant calls for Canada to become part of the US.\nWe had a taste of that just this week, when - as Canadians headed to the polls in their general election - Trump took to Truth Social to call on Canadians to elect him, seemingly referring to himself as a candidate, to reap the benefits of being the \"cherished\" 51st state.\n\"America can no longer subsidise Canada with the hundreds of billions a year that we have been spending in the past,\" he said. \"It makes no sense unless Canada is a state\".\nHow that impacts dual citizens or mixed-status families is a bit harder to answer.\nBut we're seen a newfound sense of nationalism among many Canadians in response to Trump's rhetoric and policies, and some Americans in Canada have even reportedly given up their citizenship.\nWhile cross-border ties are very unlikely to ground to a standstill, many Canadian citizens - even those with US families - are likely to be more cautious when crossing the border, particularly after high-profile cases of Canadians being detained at the border.\nIn one case, an actress named Jasmine Moody was detained by ICE for about two weeks, later writing about her experience in a viral article in the Guardian.\nA reader asks what Trump's first 100 days tell us about how he'd handle a major international crisis, like another pandemic or a war.\nIt's hard to say how exactly Trump would handle a major international crisis, but we have had glimpses that may provide a few clues.\nTrump's first crisis came just over a week into his administration on 29 January, when a US Army helicopter collided with a passenger aircraft over the Potomac river in Washington DC, killing 67 people.\nLater that morning, I sat in the White House briefing room as Trump - with no evidence - alleged that the diversity, equity and inclusion policies at the Federal Aviation Administration may have led to the crash.\nThis suggests that in the event of a crisis, Trump is later to \"fire from the hip\", sometimes speaking before all the facts are established. Many will remember Trump's initial dismissal of the Covid-19 pandemic in his first administration, sometimes downplaying it as something that would soon \"disappear\".\nMore so than other presidents, Trump also leans heavily on the power of the executive branch, making decisions from the Oval Office that have real-world implications, sometimes bypassing any discussion on Capitol Hill.\nThose close to Trump are quick to say that he listens intently to his advisors, often letting discussions play out amongst them before his eyes. This is, for example, largely what happened with the tariffs issue.\nUltimately, however, he is the one who decides the government's course of action, even if he lets his inner circle - which is perhaps more loyal and disciplined than in the last administration - carry out the details.\nArafin in Bangladesh wants to know how developing countries can navigate this evolving trade landscape and mitigate the risks.\nThere is just no way poorer countries could ever eliminate their trade surplus with the United States.\nThe world envisioned by Donald Trump - where citizens of developing countries buy as many American products as are sold the other way - is simply not possible.\nThe average Bangladeshi citizen, for example, is 32 times poorer than the average American.\nIn this case, the best Bangladeshi officials could do is promise Washington they will reduce some non-tariff barriers that are in place that make it hard for American companies to do business there.\nFor example, they could scrap quotas on imports, cut red tape or tackle corruption more effectively.\nThese small concessions - along with the assumption that American consumers won't put up with rocketing prices - may lead to a softening or removal of Trump's tariffs.\nAfter all, if countries with large and cheap workforces can't sell Americans affordable goods, then who will?\nOne other thing that developing countries will want to consider closely is the role of China in all of this.\nIf you're a worker in a clothing factory in Bangladesh, a 37% US tax might seem a crippling blow to your livelihood - but it's still better than the 125% tariff that Chinese manufacturers are facing.\nAs a Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer told me recently: \"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit us\".\nLimiting dealings with China has been suggested as a way for developing countries to get a better trade deal with the White House. But that isn't very realistic.\nBeijing is by far and away the number one investor in the developing world. If you live in Africa, Asia or South America - it's probably China building your railways, factories and power plants, not the United States.\nThe American consumer market is still the richest in the world and developing countries will want to fight tooth and nail to maintain access to it - but equally there is no way they can side with the US over China.\n\nChris in County Durham, UK, asks if Donald Trump is making millions of dollars on the US stock market by initiating a slump in share values, buying heavy, then reversing his policies to watch his share prices rocket up.\nCritics are accusing President Trump of manipulating the stock market. White House officials have denied the allegations, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it part of Trump's \"art of the deal\".\nHere's what we know so far:\nOn 9 April, Trump posted on Truth Social, in all caps: \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY! DJT.\" Shortly after, he announced he was pausing the toughest tariffs for 90 days. In between, options traders placed big bets on a market rebound, which ended up being spot on.\nThis led to accusations of market manipulation and insider trading, with Democrats like Senator Adam Schiff calling for an investigation.\nHowever, these cases are hard to prove \u2013 and even harder when you're talking about the president. Legal experts say it would be a \"high\" bar to prove Trump did something illegal in this case. Plus he posted the information publicly.\nClaims of insider trading might have some merit under the STOCK Act, which restricts public officials from profiting off non-public information. Although the White House could argue that the President can't \"gain\" information about policy changes if he \"created\" them.\nSo, it's still up in the air \u2013 but probably not something he needs to lose sleep over.\nJean-Claude asks if there any way within the US Constitution by which Congress could stop Trump's tariffs and take away his freedom to issue Executive Orders at will.\nDonald Trump has been pushing the boundaries of presidential authority with both his tariff declarations and more than 130 executive orders.\nTo do so, he has been asserting that Congress has given him the power to take these actions. To answer your question simply, then - any power that Congress gives, Congress can take back.\nTraditionally, executive orders are a presidential interpretation of how laws should be implemented. Congress could step in and tell the White House that those interpretations are wrong.\nTrump has been citing a 1977 law that grants him power to enact tariffs in cases of national emergency. Congress could amend that law or pass legislation that says no such emergency exists. There has already been a bipartisan proposal in the Senate to do exactly that.\nThe challenge for Trump's opponents is finding a majority in the two chambers of Congress, both narrowly controlled by Republicans, to do so. The House of Representatives, in particular, is full of Republicans who are marching in lockstep with the president. The House recently adopted a provision that would make it much harder to rescind Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, for instance.\nEven if Congress was able to reach agreement on curtailing presidential power, Trump could decide to exercise his veto to block it from becoming law \u2013 something he's already threated to do with the Senate tariff bill. And if he did that, it would take two-thirds of both chambers to override the president.\nSo Congress does have the ability to stop Trump, but perhaps not the interest or will to do so \u2013 at least not unless and until next year's midterm elections shift the balance of power in the legislature toward the Democrats.\nRachel in Canada wonders if we can comment on what the real threat of annexation is for Canada with Trump in office. Should we be worried?\nA lot depends on what the US president means when he talks about making Canada the 51st state.\nIt's unlikely that both the US and Canada would agree to it through formal means - the bar is high.\nIt would need to be approved by both chambers in the US Congress, including at least 60 votes in support in the Senate, which has 100 seats.\nIt would also likely require amending the Canadian constitution, which would likely require unanimous provincial consent - no easy task - as well as Parliament's approval.\nIt's also highly unlikely that the US would invade Canada militarily.\nTrump has spoken about forcing the issue through economic pressure - with Canada sending roughly 75% of its good south of the border, he does have some leverage.\nCanada has already been hit with tariffs from the US, including the blanket tariffs on goods, though there is currently an exception for products covered by the USMCA trade deal. Those US tariffs are already being felt in some sectors.\nHowever, Trump also appears willing to come to the negotiating table. He has said he is ready to start talks with Canada's prime minister after the federal election.\nKevin in Stockport has two questions for James Lansdale, BBC News diplomatic correspondent: Not long ago President Trump said that if Russia didn't agree to take serious steps towards ending the war he would apply massive sanctions. Russia has shown no desire to reach a peace settlement. So why is Trump not going to apply these threatened sanctions before considering ending the peace initiative?\nDonald Trump is becoming increasingly frustrated at the refusal of Vladimir Putin to agree an immediate unconditional ceasefire. Recently, after his talks with President Zelensky at the Vatican, Mr Trump questioned whether Mr Putin really wanted peace and wondered if the Russian leader was leading him on. He also once again threatened \"banking\" or \"secondary\" sanctions. \nThe latter refers to sanctions on countries that are still trading with Moscow, especially those countries \u2013 like China and India \u2013 that are fuelling the Russian war machine by buying cheap Russian energy. But imposing those sanctions would be a big step with serious economic and geostrategic consequences. So for now, Mr Trump appears to want to threaten these sanctions rather than impose them.\nWhat is the hold that Putin has over Trump?\nAnalysts say that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin developed a genuinely warm personal relationship during his first term in the White House. They say Mr Trump sees in Mr Putin an equal on the world stage whom he respects. \nThe US president also made clear he wants a rapprochement between the US and Russia, one that will reset the relationship and boost trade. Strategists say the White House is also currying favour with the Kremlin because it wants to divide Moscow from Beijing, with many US policymakers seeing China as the greater threat. As to whether Mr Putin has some kind of \"hold\" over Mr Trump, there have been many allegations about the close business links the President had over the years with Russian figures who helped his investments. \nThere were also many claims of secret Kompromat about the President held in Kremlin archives. The FBI investigated. But there was always more speculation than hard fact. So Mr Trump's relationship with Mr Putin remains something of a mystery.\nRay in the UK asks: As a convicted felon, Donald Trump isn't allowed in the UK, so how can he address Parliament?\nIt is a bit more complicated than that.\nGovernment guidance \u2013 which you can read here \u2013 spells out where it is mandatory that someone is refused entry and where it is discretionary.\nIn reality, the elected leader of an ally, in particular an ally as important as the United States, is always likely to be invited, because a government is likely to conclude that this is in the UK's national interest.\nThat is the conclusion of Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 and hence the state visit being offered to President Trump.\nThe opportunity, or not, to address Parliament is a separate question and something some are arguing should be blocked.\nOne reader, Ray, asks our BBC Security correspondent Frank Gardner: Is Trump going to give Europe the time to step in, if he decides to ditch Ukraine? \nThe transatlantic alliance - the strategic partnership between Europe and North America based on shared values - is now under more strain than at any time since the Suez Crisis of 1956.\nWithin his first 100 days President Trump has completely upended the policy of the previous US administrations. For most of the time since taking office, he has appeared to favour relations with Moscow over those with Kyiv. He has also gone against the wishes of most of Europe by vowing to end Russia's isolation and talked of lifting sanctions.\nWhereas the prevailing attitude in Europe towards Ukraine is to keep supporting its war effort 'for as long as it takes', Trump has been in a hurry to end the war and normalise relations with President Putin.\nTrump's oft-repeated intent to 'get' Greenland and make it a part of the US has appalled Denmark, of which it is a self-governing part and it has rattled Scandinavian governments. Denmark lost 257 soldiers killed and wounded in the US-led campaign in Afghanistan.  It had the highest per capita death toll of all America's allies in that war.\nTrump has, however, galvanised Europe into finally doing more for its own defence.  \nAfter the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO in February that Europe should no longer take US strategic protection for granted, budgets are being revised and Germany has now lifted its longstanding restrictions on defence spending.",

        "article_text": "Turning lawns into meadows can have big benefits for people, wildlife and the climate. Here's why 'meadowscaping' has become the latest gardening craze.\nWhen Sara Weaner Cooper and her husband bought their first home in Pennsylvania, they knew they didn't want a perfectly manicured front lawn like their neighbours. They wanted something that was more than just turf \u2013 a flourishing, wild meadow home to diverse species of plants and animals.\nIt was a bold plan, to be sure, considering it involved overhauling their entire lawn when they were new to the neighbourhood. Thankfully, Weaner Cooper had ideal support for the project \u2013 her father is Larry Weaner, a renowned ecological landscape designer (she is now chief executive of the firm he founded). The landscape design style he uses relies predominantly on native plants, she says, aiming to work with how they want to grow rather than forcing them into particular areas.\nShe grew up with a non-traditional garden curated by her father, which she remembers as a \"woodland wonderland\" because it was designed to support large trees. Today, it's still heavily wooded and teems with other native plants that prefer a shadier plot (his property gets less light than the Coopers'). Her father didn't plot it out or plant very much, she says, but did \"intentionally engage with it\", encouraging what it seemed to want to do.\nWeaner Cooper had always wanted to focus on native plants in her lawn and do less mowing, so rewilding their front lawn felt like the right move. But the Coopers' lawn is a different animal than her father's. It's in full Sun and consisted of over 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) of turfgrass \u2013 narrow-leaved grasses designed to look uniform that had to be dealt with before a meadow could fully take over. Rather than rip everything up and live with a drab, brown lawn for months, they decided to try strategically seeding and planting native plants into the existing turf, hoping it would eventually weed the turf out naturally.\u00a0\n\"It's easier in the sense that you don't need to be beating back as many weeds,\" explains Weaner Cooper. \"[The native plants] came in so thickly that [they] outcompeted a lot of the weed pressure that would have been there if we would have just made it brown.\"\nIt took about two years, lots of planning, some careful weeding, and some trial and error, but eventually a medley of waist-high native plant species blanketed their vast front lawn.\n\"Meadowscaping\", or turning a traditional lawn into a meadow, is a burgeoning trend experts in the field are noticing, especially among younger generations who tend to be more climate-aware than their predecessors. Compared to lawns, meadows \u2013 open landscapes filled with an array of non-woody plants such as tall grasses, flowers and herbs \u2013 are less expensive to maintain, require less water and energy and help sequester more CO2. Most importantly, they also encourage biodiversity and they're typically more appealing to pollinators, which are keystone species on which ecosystems depend.\nClimate change and habitat degradation are leading to major losses of native species in ecosystems worldwide, which in turn can disrupt how those ecosystems function. Meanwhile, lawns cover about 23% of the US's urban land areas and 70 to 75% of open green space in cities worldwide. The more people who rewild their lawns, the more significant the environmental impacts that could be seen, from lower pollution and stormwater runoff to a reduction in soil erosion and urban heat island effects, all while improving local biodiversity and soil and groundwater quality.\nBut meadowscaping isn't as simple as only locking your mower away (sorry, NoMoMay). There are methods to meadowscaping, and they aren't always the most intuitive, especially for beginners. To help others get started, Weaner Cooper's landscape design firm developed an online course taught by her father that walks interested parties through the steps, from interweaving aesthetics and ecology to addressing practical garden issues.\nOne of the most common questions from participants in the course, Weaner Cooper says, is, \"How should I handle my neighbours who might not appreciate how my meadow looks while it's in progress?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nShe used a clever solution for her own property: a sign in her garden that reads \"native meadow in progress\". \"I put my email, and I was just, like, 'ask me questions,'\" she says. No one reached out directly, but cars sometimes stopped to take pictures.\u00a0\nIn fact, Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states actively encouraging homeowners to transition their lawns to meadows. In 2020, the\u00a0Pennsylvania Department of Natural Resources\u00a0started a lawn conversion programme that in some cases helps finance meadow projects.\u00a0\n\"They cannot keep up with the demand,\" says Shishir Paudel, a plant ecologist at the Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \"It started in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, and it [was] so successful that they expanded into western Pennsylvania last year.\"\nPaudel and his colleague Sarah States, director of research and science education at the Phipps Conservatory, spent the last six years studying the differences in environmental impacts between traditional and meadowed lawns. He hopes the metrics they collected will help convince more people to convert their lawns. But it's the financial disparity that he thinks may turn the most heads: as well as being cheaper to set up than a conventional lawn, a seeded meadow is far more affordable to maintain.\u00a0\n\"You are likely to spend more than seven times more to manage one hectare of traditional lawn compared to meadow,\" says Paudel.\u00a0\nMaintaining a meadow also typically involves less work than regularly mowing a traditional lawn, but it's not completely hands off.\u00a0\"Every couple of weeks in the peak season I go out and trim things back, or mow the paths through the meadow,\" says Weaner Cooper. \"And it looks very intentional.\"\nStill, meadowscaping doesn't have to look as wild as the Coopers' lawn. Take Marc Johnson's meadow in Toronto, Canada. A professor of biology at the University of Toronto, Mississauga, his research on how urban landscapes impact plant-pollinator interactions inspired him to create various pollinator gardens within his front yard (and label them accordingly).\u00a0\nInitially, his house had a \"pristine\" traditional lawn that the previous owner had maintained using lots of pesticides. Johnson did away with the pesticides and took a staged approach to his meadowscaping. Unlike the Coopers, he focused on creating specific smaller pollinator gardens within his yard. He also primed the lawn somewhat differently, clearing away much of the existing turf, putting down new soil, and then planting a large portion of native perennials, plants that come back year after year.\n\"And so, one garden at a time, we started to convert that space into pollinator gardens of different themes and flavours,\" says Johnson. \"We just gradually took up the entire lawn.\"\nPollinator populations worldwide have declined precipitously over the last few decades. Monarch butterflies have been particularly impacted, and in just the last 20 years, the US has lost one-fifth of all its butterfly populations. But within the first year of his lawn conversion, Johnson says he began to see pollinators arriving to his flowering plants.\n\"You start to see pollinators that you have never seen in your yard before, and you didn't even know were in the area,\" he says. \"One of the favourites for the bees and the butterflies would be purple coneflower. It is a very hardy, easy-to-grow perennial that's very common in gardens. I'd say it's one of the best species for people to start with.\"\nStarting your own meadow\nThere are several ways to meadowscape a lawn, and what works on one property might not on another.\u00a0\nStill, experts agree you should aim for mostly native plant species (above 70% is often cited), with the ideal plants varying based on location. Johnson suggests finding a reputable nursery and asking them which are easy to grow and likely to come back.\nHe also recommends starting small. \"Even creating a diverse little garden on an apartment balcony can have an impact,\" he says.\u00a0\nIf you're looking for a quicker turnaround, you can remove the lawn with natural lawn and weed killer, such as white vinegar, or pull it up and start from scratch, says Weaner Cooper. It's more intensive, and you'll have a brown lawn for a time, but it'll give your new native species more room and fresher soil to grow.\nAs the various gardens on his lawn grew taller, Johnson's neighbours began asking questions, mainly about how they could do the same on their properties, he says \u2013 and none complained about his lack of lawn. After about two years, the whole yard transformed into a patchwork quilt of gardens. One section is entirely dedicated to evening primroses, a plant of particular biological interest to Johnson.\nJohnson describes his lawn as his own version of a national park. It's frequented by hummingbirds, endangered monarchs, and various species of bees, he says, which he even built a bee hotel for \u2013 although it's not intended to house honeybees, he says, which are not a native species in North America.\u00a0\n\"[The holes in the wood] are for the more diverse and ecologically important solitary bees, most of which are native,\" Johnson explains. \"There are many different species that are nesting in there right now. And they are coexisting, although they are competing. It's not necessarily a happy time, but there is a lot of diversity in that one location.\"\nJohnson's yard certainly involves some upkeep, especially as he tries to maintain the themes of his specific gardens, but he also recognises its need to evolve. \"Every year is different because the species are competing. If something gets really abundant, sometimes a pathogen will come in and wipe it out, and then other things start to come in.\"\nThis natural cycling of species is part of what makes meadows more resilient. Plant and animal species may compete from time to time, but that's an element of a healthy ecosystem that encourages natural selection and adaptation.\nA recent study at King's College at the University of Cambridge in the UK, which measured the effects of rewilding half of the college's 300-year-old lawn, saw similar ecological benefits to meadowscaping. It found the meadow side was more climate resilient than the traditional side of the lawn, reflecting away 25% more sunlight, which helps protect the inhabitants from heat damage.\nPlants typically found in meadows also tend to be more deep-rooted and, thus, more drought-tolerant. This makes them ideal for drier areas or those with limits to water consumption. What's more, their roots can help prevent stormwater runoff and even improve groundwater quality.\n\"In those diverse systems with the deep roots, [water] makes its way down into the bottom of the soil and then into the groundwater system,\" says Paudel. \"At the same time, it's filtered through [the vegetation] when it goes into the groundwater, so the water becomes fresher, less polluted.\"\nXeriscaping, or meadowscaping with predominantly drought-tolerant plants, has been a water-saving practice in the American West for over 80 years. Government agencies that help landowners implement the practice have seen strong results: 18,000 properties in Southern Nevada, for example, saw an overall 30% reduction in annual water use and a 54% reduction in water costs after converting their turf landscapes to xeriscapes.\nSimilar plants can mitigate stormwater runoff, so Johnson planted some in a ditch on his property that was prone to flooding, creating a bioswale \u2013 a shallow trench designed to slow runoff with plants that help absorb the water into the ground. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear: How allergies are affecting animals\n\u2022  Resurrection plants: The drought-resistant 'zombie plants' that come back from the dead\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\"We put in plants that are especially adapted to wetlands but can also survive dry periods,\" he says.\nThe plants help stormwater runoff by rapidly sucking up water, both storing it in their leaves and using it for evapotranspiration, whereby plants release water to the atmosphere through the stomata in their leaves as they bring in CO2 for photosynthesis. \"When I put water at one end of the ditch, by the time it got to the right-hand side of that, most of the water is gone,\" says Johnson.\nLarge-scale bioswales are even being implemented in cities like New York City to reduce flooding from sewer overflows and stormwater, which can pollute nearby bodies of water.\nDoing the heavy lifting (lawn turnover and initial planting) of meadowscaping is easier during the winter months, when most lawns are dormant anyway \u2013 a process called winter sowing. Melanie Rekola, a horticulturist and professional landscape designer in Canada, did just this.\u00a0\n\"We scraped away all the sod with machinery, and then we put down a little bit of soil, and I got a 100% native wildflower mix and we spread it,\" she says. \"You spread it in the fall after a couple of frosts. Then all winter, those seeds get their cold stratification [exposure to cold, damp air that helps it germinate when it gets warm again] and the moisture they need, and then they come up in springtime, like they've always been there.\"\u00a0\nAs the Coopers demonstrated, however, you don't need to remove everything from your lawn to plant a meadow. Paudel suggests a process called solarisation, where you cover your lawn with clear plastic in the summer, which traps heat and kills the turf. \"In one week, grass will die, and then you plant, deliberately,\" he says.\nStill, meadowscaping does have its limitations, one of the biggest being invasive species, which can overtake the native plants in a meadow if you don't keep an eye out for them. \"Keeping up with the weeding does take a little bit of time, like they don't know where the border of [a] garden is,\" says Johnson.\nMeadowed lawns have been shown to have notable health benefits and may even reduce the amount of air and sound pollution that enters your home. Paudel says even roadside vegetation acts as a physical barrier and filter: \"Vegetation holds air particles. If you live roadside and have tall plants, less air pollution will enter your house.\" Surrounding yourself with nature is also linked to reduced pain, improved cognitive function and restored attention and executive functioning in children and adolescents.\n\"It's a mental health booster. You look out your window in the spring, summer, fall, and almost every day, it's changing and it's beautiful,\" says Weaner Cooper.\u00a0\nAnd while it takes a fair amount of intentional curating, those who've rewilded their lawns seem to feel something beyond pride; rather more of a reverent stewardship of their local ecosystem.\n\"Imagine if half of an urban population took that view,\" says Johnson. \"We could dramatically change our ecosystems for the better, making cities much healthier environments.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

Lewis Ludlam beat Ben Hammersley to a grubber kick for the third after a fine passing move, before Harris went in after Tomos Williams, Christian Wade and Ruan Ackermann linked up to set up the Scotland centre.\nExeter's defence continued to struggle as Seb Atkinson strode through a massive gap 22 metres out to go in under the posts for the fifth try after 26 minutes, and it was just as tepid three minutes later when Anscombe got the sixth.\nIt took 32 minutes for Exeter to get into Gloucester's red zone as Paul Brown-Bampoe went close before Exeter lost the ball, although a minute later Josh Hodge at least got his side on the scoreboard when he raced in from 22 metres.\nBut once again Exeter's defence melted as Williams' lovely looping pass started a move that the Welsh scrum-half got on the end of for the seventh try shortly before half-time.\nExeter made five changes five minutes into the second period, but a minute later went further behind when Wade raced on to pick up his own chipped kick and was stopped just short of the Exeter line, only for Ford-Robinson to dot down from an inch or two out a few phases later.\nWade edged closer to the all-time Premiership try record when his chipped kick was gathered by Carreras, before the Argentine full-back gave it back for his 90th try in the league, and Atkinson got his second soon after when Carreras shook off a tackle from Brown-Bampoe to race in from distance to make it 60-7.\nIt continued to get embarrassing for the former European champions as Singleton broke off a lineout maul for the 11th try, 18 minutes into the second half, and the replacement hooker dotted down in the corner five minutes later when Gloucester broke the 70-point mark for the first time in a Premiership match.\nWhen Exeter did think they had scored a try it was ruled out for a forward pass, as Hodge was denied shortly after Singleton's second score, with Exeter's Will Haydon-Wood sin-binned for a tackle off the ball moments later.\nFrom the resulting penalty Gloucester kicked out the corner and Singleton was mauled in for his third try to take it to 79-7 with 11 minutes left, before Will Rigg and Haydon-Wood scored two late consolation tries for a shell-shocked Exeter side.\nGloucester head coach George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucester:\n\"It's obviously a good day for us. The most pleasing thing for me is the balance of the tries was good.\n\"We've had a tough couple of weeks away from home and we didn't feel the balance of our game was quite right.\n\"But I thought today the boys used the maul well, they used the scrum well and when we attacked we looked really good and our defence as very good as well.\n\"Whilst we're a really good attacking team, we have to have the balance of the game to compete.\"\nExeter head coach Rob Hunter told BBC Radio Devon:\n\"In my many years as a coach that is my lowest point.\n\"You can't put any gloss at all on that. That's a heavy beating and at this stage it's a real kick in the teeth.\n\"In no way at all did we have any foothold in that game - nothing really held up and we gave up momentum so easily.\n\"You've got to not hide away from it, you've got to take responsibility that comes from putting the shirt on, and that will be our first point of call, and then we'll try and sit through the whys and hows.\n\"Right now it's important that we wear it and recognise that that is not an acceptable level of performance from anybody involved.\"\nGloucester: Carreras; Wade, Harris, S Atkinson, Morris; Anscombe, Williams; Rapava Ruskin, Blake, Fasogbon, Clark, Thomas, Clement, Ludlow (capt), Ackermann\nReplacements: Singleton, Ford-Robinson, Gotovtsev, Jordan, Clarke, Englefield, C Atkinson, Cotgreave\nExeter: Hodge; Hammersley, Slade, Hawkins, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Armstrong; Sio, Yeandle, Street, Tuima, Jenkins (capt), E Roots, Vintcent, Fisilau\nReplacements: Norey, Blose, Iosefa-Scott, Capstick, Vermeulen, Townsend, Haydon-Wood, Rigg\nYellow card: Haydon-Wood 68\nReferee: Karl Dickson",

        "article_text": "Canadians will cast their ballots on Monday in a pivotal election that has been completely transformed by US President Donald Trump.\nThe Conservatives appeared certain to win any contest by a landslide at the start of the year, until Trump's tariffs and barbs about making Canada the \"51st state\" upended the country's politics and injected fresh life into Mark Carney's Liberal Party.\nThe final polls suggest the Liberals are slightly ahead, although the race has tightened in the past week and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre says his party can win.\nThe 36-day campaign ended on a sombre note as party leaders responded to the Saturday evening car ramming that killed 11 people in Vancouver.\nCarney, the incumbent prime minister, cancelled a stop in Hamilton on Sunday morning to address the nation following the attack, which saw an SUV ram into a crowd gathered for a local Filipino festival.\nPoilievre, meanwhile, added a campaign stop in Mississauga, a Toronto suburb, to speak with members of the Filipino community there.\nLater in the day, Carney held a spree of events in three provinces - Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia - in a final push to get out the vote in western Canada, where the Conservatives have more support.\nTrump's decision to impose 25% tariffs on America's northern neighbour and his repeated threats to annex the country as the \"51st state\" fanned deep anger as well as feelings of Canadian nationalism. It led hockey fans to boo the US national anthem before games, a sign of just how suddenly decades of stable US-Canada relations had been shaken.\nThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed by many as a referendum on how Canada should approach the man fresh into his second term in the White House.\nDuring campaign stops, Carney, 60, often spoke of the need to counter an existential threat from President Trump, who he said was \"trying to break us so the US can own us\".\nHe positioned himself as best fit to lead the country through the present crisis, leaning on his experience as the former central banker for Canada during the Great Recession and for the UK at the Bank of England during Brexit.\nAt a campaign stop in Saskatoon on Sunday, Carney said Canada should strengthen its ties with other \"reliable trade partners\" like the UK and the European Union. Earlier in the election, he said the old relationship that Canada had enjoyed with the US for decades was \"over\".\nMeanwhile, Conservative leader Poilievre made his final stops in Ontario where polls indicate his party is trailing behind. The populous province is home to 122 seats in Parliament out of 343 that could alter the outcome of the election. A party must win 172 seats to have a majority government. The Liberals currently hold 152 seats, the most of any party, but they would have to pick up a significant number of seats to control the House of Commons.\nMuch of Poilievre's messaging has centred on what he has called the \"lost Liberal decade\" under the leadership of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who stepped down earlier this year when his party was ailing in the polls.\nThe Conservative leader frequently drew upon frustrations with soaring housing costs, unaffordability and crime to pitch himself as the change that Canadians need.\n\"We need to vote for change so you can afford food and homes,\" he told supporters at a campaign stop in Peterborough, a city north-east of Toronto.\nAnd with the election shaping up as a race between the Conservatives and the Liberals, smaller parties have struggled to gain traction.\nThe left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, faces the prospect of losing a number of seats as it trails behind the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which runs candidates only in the French-speaking province of Quebec.\nSingh cancelled a number of campaign events on Sunday in light of the deadly attack in Vancouver. The NDP leader, who is running for re-election in a Vancouver-area riding, was meeting supporters at the Lapu Lapu festival minutes before the attack. He appeared visibly emotional when he spoke to the media afterwards.\nThroughout the election, Singh called on Canadians to vote for his party's candidates so they can act as a check on power in Ottawa. \nThe Bloc has also struggled, with fears over Trump's threats and Canada's future fuelling anxiety throughout the country and pushing voters towards the bigger federal parties.\nHistorically, Canada has only been led by Liberal or Conservative governments. \nWhile President Trump has been a central figure to Canada's election, he has steered clear of commenting on its outcome.\nBut the Trump administration has continued its rhetoric on taking over Canada. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that \"the president has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state\".\nPolls will open at 08:30 local time on Monday in Newfoundland and Labrador (12:00 GMT). The election will span across six time zones, with the last polls closing in British Columbia at 19:00 PST (03:00 GMT on Tuesday). \nA record number of Canadians - more than 7 million - have already cast their ballots in advance.",

It led hockey fans to boo the US national anthem before games, a sign of just how suddenly decades of stable US-Canada relations had been shaken.Watch: The \u2018Trump effect\u2019 and other things to watch for as Canada votesThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed by many as a referendum on how Canada should approach the man fresh into his second term in the White House.During campaign stops, Carney, 60, often spoke of the need to counter an existential threat from President Trump, who he said was \"trying to break us so the US can own us\".Follow the latest Canada election news hereHe positioned himself as best fit to lead the country through the present crisis, leaning on his experience as the former central banker for Canada during the Great Recession and for the UK at the Bank of England during Brexit.At a campaign stop in Saskatoon on Sunday, Carney said Canada should strengthen its ties with other \"reliable trade partners\" like the UK and the European Union. The Liberals currently hold 152 seats, the most of any party, but they would have to pick up a significant number of seats to control the House of Commons.Much of Poilievre's messaging has centred on what he has called the \"lost Liberal decade\" under the leadership of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who stepped down earlier this year when his party was ailing in the polls.The Conservative leader frequently drew upon frustrations with soaring housing costs, unaffordability and crime to pitch himself as the change that Canadians need.",

        "article_text": "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia.\nOutside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins.\nHome to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.\nFor Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.\nRunning the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.\nBurnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.\nStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.\nA once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.\nAs a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\nHealth has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.\nBut experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.\nAustralians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.\nHealthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.\nSeeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.\nThough she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.\n\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"\nWhen Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".\nHealth funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.\nPatients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.\nMedicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.\nFast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.\nThere is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.\nBut the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.\nThat is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.\nAccording to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.\nBut experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.\nBrisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.\n\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"\nAnd every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.\n\"[I] just can't keep up.\"\nThis is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. \nSo his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?\nThis year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.\nThe results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"\nAnd that's just primary care.\nPublic specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.\nThere are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.\nThe BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.\nOthers are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.\nKimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.\n\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.\n\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"\nAnother woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.\n\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.\nThe people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.\n\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.\nAll of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.\nEvery single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.\nStreaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.\nIt's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.\n\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.\n\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"\nShe came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.\nIt's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.\n\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.\nWhen the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.\nIt means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.\n\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.\nLike many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.\nThere's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.\nMany doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.\nHealth economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.\nThe taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.\n\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"\nThe original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.\nShe says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. \nBoth the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.\n\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.\nOn the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.\nHis government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.\nBut the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. \nProposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.\nOne Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.\nLabor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".\nBut many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. \nThere's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.\nExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.\nThat is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.\nAnd the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.\n\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.\nIn Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late.

        "summary": "On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.Burnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.Victoria Bradley is the only doctor in the community of Streaky BayStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.A once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.As a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.The cracks in a 'national treasure'Healthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.Seeing a local GP was the least of her problems. \"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.Like many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.There's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.Many doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.Health economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.The taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them. There's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.Getty ImagesIn remote towns like Streaky Bay, people wonder if the damage to universal healthcare is already irreparableExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.That is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.And the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost. \"Access to healthcare has emerged as a key issue ahead of the May 3 election The original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.She says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.Fast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.There is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics.",

You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

        "article_text": "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.\nWhen he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.\nAll her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.\nYunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.\nShe was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.\nThe Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.\nBut a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.\nTen of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks. \nOut of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.\nMost of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".\nAbbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not. \nOne has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia. \nBy the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.\nOn the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.\nAt around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.\nThey threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.\nShe was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs. \nShe called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.\n\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"\nKim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.\n\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman. \nThe language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.\nThey found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him. \nBecause she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.\nBut instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.\nThen, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.\nTraumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.\nIt wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.\n\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.\n\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.\nBut while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.\n\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.\n\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.\nBut in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.\nOther details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.\nThe next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.\nPolice arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".\nFrench media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.\nThe question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.\nCourt documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.\nBut how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?\nThe documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.\nMr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".\nHe added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.\nGary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.\n\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".\nThe trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up. \nPolice tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.\nMany jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.\nAs for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.\nKim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.\nIn an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".\nSoon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.\n\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.\nPatricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".\n\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed. \n\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"\nThe gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.\n\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.\nAround mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness. \nCameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.\nIn his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.\nHowever, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.\n\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

        "summary": "When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".Getty / Marc PiaseckiKim Kardashian arriving at 'L'Avenue' restaurant with body guard Pascal Duvier on 2 October 2016French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. It has never been found.Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was. 'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\". The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.Getty Images / Marc PiaseckiYunice Abbas, author of the book I held up Kim KardashianTen of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",

We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "Arsenal are in the semi-finals of the Champions League for only the third time\nArsenal's run to the Champions League semi-finals has been a \"beautiful story\" but the Gunners \"want much more\", says manager Mikel Arteta as they prepare to host Paris St-Germain.\nArteta said Tuesday's first leg (20:00 BST) is \"one of the biggest games the Emirates Stadium has seen\", and called on fans to \"play every ball together\".\nArsenal beat reigning champions Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals  and will now face French side PSG, who they beat 2-0 in the league phase in October.\nThe Gunners, who have never won the Champions League, last reached the semi-finals in 2009 where they suffered a 4-1 aggregate defeat by Manchester United.\nManaged by Arsene Wenger, they also lost the 2006 final to Barcelona.\n\"You feel [the weight of history],\" said Arteta on the eve of the semi-final first leg.  \n\"Especially because we have a lot of people who have worked at this club for many, many years and they've never been in this position. That tells you how unique and beautiful this is.\n\"We are making history. It's a beautiful story right now - but we want much more.\"\nArsenal's season has been hampered by injuries to key players including Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Ben White.\nThey have won only one of their past four Premier League matches, which helped Liverpool clinch the title on Sunday with four games to spare.\nBut in Europe they have won six of their eight league-phase games and also beat PSV Eindhoven 9-3 on aggregate in the last 16 on their way to the semi-finals. \nArteta added: \"The fact that we are here as one of the four best teams in Europe, it tells about the mindset, spirit and how much we really want it.\" \nHis squad will be boosted by the return of Mikel Merino and White to training, but Arteta also challenged the Gunners faithful to create an even better atmosphere than in the 3-0 win against Real Madrid. \n\"I'm not exaggerating. Guys, bring your boots, your shorts and T-shirt and let's play every ball together,\" said Areta, who is eyeing his first major silverware at the club since the FA Cup in 2020. \n\"You want to do something special? That place has to be something special. Something we haven't seen.\"\nA fluffed Panenka, controversy & 'statement win' for Arsenal\n'He was immense' - Rice lauded as 'one of the best on the planet'\nSuperb Arsenal defeat Real to reach semi-finals\nGoals from Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka inflicted a 2-0 defeat on Luis Enrique's PSG in October\nParis St-Germain looked far from serious Champions League contenders when they lost to Arsenal in the league phase.\nThe Ligue 1 side only won once and lost three of their first five games in Europe before squeezing through to the knockout-phase play-offs in 15th place. \nBut Luis Enrique believes his side are \"a more complete team\" seven months on. \n\"I think there are some big differences [from the Arsenal defeat],\" the PSG manager said. \n\"I watched that match again and saw our progress. I think we're a better team and we've shown that throughout the competition. \n\"We had the toughest league phase. At first I thought it was detrimental, but in the end it was positive because it helped us progress.\n\"We are a more complete team and we now want to write a page in history.\" \nPSG, who were crowned domestic champions again this month, are aiming for a first Champions League title despite the exits of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar. \nAfter beating fellow French club Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the play-offs, they overcame successive English opponents in Liverpool and Aston Villa.\nBefore the semi-final, Luis Enrique said he sees similarities between his side and Arteta's Arsenal.\n\"They are built as a team with collective strength - you can see that from the way they attack and defend,\" he said.\n\"They do everything together. Of course, they have some top-level players, just like we do, but they don't rely on just one player.

        "article_text": "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday. \nRed El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.\nBut the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear. \nThe grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"\nInformation is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.\nHere is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.\nFollow live: Travel chaos continues\nS\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".\nMr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.\nOne issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.\nHowever, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.\nSo what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.\nThe mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50HRZ in Europe and the UK.\nIf that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.\n\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.\nIf lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.\nBut when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.\nRenewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.\n\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.\nProf Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.\n\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.\n\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"\nRed El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.\nTwo basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines called AC/DC lines.\nSpain has an AC/DC line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.\nThe Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.\nS\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.\nPortugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.\nThe message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".\n\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\" \nHowever, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

        "article_text": "Grace Buckle is a three-time National Amateur heavyweight champion\n'Amazing' Grace Buckle is a unique boxing talent.\nHer recent win at the National Amateur Championships (NAC) confirmed her status as the best female heavyweight in England.\nBut as well as an accomplished star in the ring, Buckle is also a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter.\nHer signing skills are an inextricable part of her remarkable story.\n\"BSL helps you read body language,\" says Buckle.\n\"I get a sense of where people are going to hit me, what they are trying to do, where they are targeting.\"\nThe child of deaf parents, BSL was Buckle's first language.\n\"It was mainly a single-parent household,\" says Buckle. \"I would support my mum by answering phone calls and reading letters.\"\n\"Of course, I could take advantage of this,\" she adds.\n\"When I was misbehaving at school, teachers threatened to call home and I'd reply, 'Go on then'.\"\nAs a BSL translator, Buckle is already at the top of the game. She teaches BSL and has no doubt about the value of the classes to her own career.\n\"All teaching is symbiotic; it makes you reflect on what you know,\" she says.\nEncouraged by Miriam Dubois, who is deaf and the sister of British boxing royalty and world champions Caroline and Daniel Dubois, Buckle's BSL skills were recently put to use at the Royal Albert Hall, where she signed the all-female card headlined by Natasha Jonas and Lauren Price in February.\nBuckle also signed at Daniel's spectacular knockout victory over Anthony Joshua at Wembley last September.\nFrom dragging tyres up hills in South London to a gold rush and signing ringside at some of the biggest fights of the past year, the 33-year-old has come a long way in a short time.\nBuckle signed the all-female card at the Royal Albert Hall in February for deaf viewers\nBuckle's boxing and BSL life have seamlessly moulded together, but she came to boxing late just three years ago.\nThe Covid pandemic proved a pivotal moment, tying together different aspects of Grace's life.\nTo combat the isolation of lockdown, Buckle began online \u2013 and then in-person - fitness sessions designed to piece together community spirit for groups such as the Deaf Ethnic Women's Association (DEWA) in north London.\nInstruction, counting down and motivation all came with new challenges. Along with the greater use of visual aids, the key to successful sessions, explains Grace, was the ability to demonstrate and emphasise exercises.\nA rare positive legacy of the pandemic was the passing of the British Sign Language Act 2022, which made BSL one of the recognised languages of Great Britain.\nWhen she first won the NACs in 2023, Buckle was a novice boxing out of Miquel's gym in Brixton.\nHer triumph at the NACs, when she beat Emily Asquith, a European champion at youth level - despite only having one amateur bout and a handful of white-collar fights under her belt - provided the foundation for a rapid rise.\nBuckle subsequently beat the Kazak Lazzat Kungeibayeva, previously a gold medallist at the world championships, at her first overseas tournament for England.\nShe would go on to win the 2023 Haringey Box Cup, another NAC gold medal in 2024 and the Golden Girl tournament in Sweden in 2025.\n\"You do get natural born fighters,\" says Quinton Shillingford, Buckle's current coach.\n\"It's not just a question of technique and motivation, it's about whether you keep coming forward when you are hurt and have taken a shot.\n\"Grace's mum and dad are both deaf and I know she takes inspiration from them.\n\"She's always saying 'my mum is so strong'. She knows the difficulties they have had to navigate.\"\nBack in the ring, Buckle has not had things all her own way.\nA loss to Celine Lee-Lo of New Zealand at Haringey last year was the catalyst for a move to Shillingford's Heart of Portsmouth gym and her triumph at this years NACs.\n\"I used to think it was a clich\u00e9, but there is a lot of wisdom in the idea, 'that it's not a loss, it's a learning',\" Buckle says.\nClaressa Shields (L) recently fired the women's heavyweight division into the mainstream by becoming undisputed champion\nThe heavyweight division is generally the glamour weight class in boxing, housing the biggest stars and attracting the most attention.\nThe UK's biggest attractions of recent years has been Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury's run as heavyweight world champions.\nBut the women's weight category that has hitherto been neglected. There are no women's categories above middleweight in the Olympic Games, but there is a potential path for Buckle through this year's World Championships to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2026.\nPerhaps after that the opportunity to turn professional?\n\"Interest will grow in the heavyweights for the same reason as the category attracts attention for the men because you might see a killer knockout,\" Shillingford says.\nClarissa Shields became the first undisputed female heavyweight champion in February.\nThe self-proclaimed GWOAT of women's boxing, her win could well prove to be the start of an exciting new era for a women's weight.\nShillingford says Buckle can be the female heavyweight hope in the UK.\n\"Grace has ability, athleticism, and an incredible willingness to learn.

Harlequins wing Cameron Anderson, concussed on the floor, being shown a red card. England team-mates Alex Dombrandt and Ollie Chessum squaring up.\nThere were plenty of flashpoints at Mattioli Woods Welford Road on Saturday.\nYet the dedicated away fans section stubbornly refused to ignite into more than mild frustration.\nOn the fringes, where Richard Buck, sporting a Harlequins' striped blazer, and Phil Ellis, a slightly bewildered Leicester season ticket holder of 16 years, sat side by side, the only thing lobbed between the two were pleasantries and cheery small talk.\n\"I've been a bit ambused by this today,\" Ellis smiled. \"You usually get the odd smattering of away fans but this is a bit more concentrated than normal.\"\n\"They are all good lads though.\"\nPhil Ellis (left) and Richard Buck sat side by side on the edge of a block of Harlequins fans\n'Away ends arrive in rugby' shouted the headlines - including our's -  last month when Premiership Rugby last announced two trial matches with specified areas for visiting supporters.\nIt is a story with couple of caveats though.\nFirstly, they aren't really away ends. At least certainly not the aggro-and-pyro, strict segregation scenario the phrase brings to mind in this country.\nFans are not kept apart. And neither are they forced to sit with their own tribe. The option to mix in with the hosts is still there and taken by many.\nAnd, secondly, away ends haven't just arrived in rugby. Travelling fan groups have been block-booking sections of opposition stands off their own backs for decades.\nQuinssa - Harlequins' supporters association, external - are one of the most proactive.\nThey have concentrated more than a thousand fans together on European jaunts, where ticket offices are more accommodating and the idea of any travelling fans is novel.\nTheir members, given a dedicated area because of Covid restrictions of the time, helped inspire their team's semi-final comeback against Bristol at Ashton Gate in 2021.\nTheir club's trip to Welford Road, which holds more than 25,000, was an obvious pick for the Premiership's trial.\nMarcus Smith takes a selfie with travelling fans after Harlequins' Champions Cup match away to Bordeaux-Begles in 2024\n\"It is a great initiative,\" said Leicester chief executive Andrea Pinchen, playing host.\n\"We want to be innovative, we want to try new things and it adds to the atmosphere with fans of both sides getting louder and louder,\"\nHer Quins counterpart Laurie Dalrymple, who was previously managing director of Premier League football side Wolves, agrees.\n\"It isn't the catch-all that is going to fix all the challenges we have had in our sport over the past few years, but not necessarily about that,\" he said.\n\"It is about giving a slightly different fan experience for the diversifying audience that we need to reach and grow.\"\nAllow X content?\nThis article contains content provided by X.

We don't want to be like football, but we still want an element of that competition. Definitely.\"\nBrandon Wells and Megan Schroeder (centre left and right) and friends Poppy and Cameron were supportive of the 'away ends' initiative\n\"I am all for it,\" added Brandon Wells.\n\"It builds the atmosphere, and you are more inclined to travel if you are sat with people you know and you can sing the same songs.\n\"I am worried our game is going to die. We need to grow the game and this is a step in the right direction.\"\nNick and Joel Baker, attending with their Leicester-supporting partners and sat among the Tigers fans, summed up the split.\n\"I am a bit more old school,\" said Nick. \"I like mixing in together and having a laugh and a bit of fun. There is never any nastiness at rugby, it's not like football where you need the segregation. I am not a great fan of it, to be honest.\"\n\"I think it is good to have the option,\" said Joel. \"If you support a club and now live in a different part of the country, it is nice to sit in with your fellow fans. \n\"I have lived in Leicester for five or six years and it is nice to hear some familiar accents when they come to town.\"\nRachael Pawley, far right, admitted giving Harlequins-supporting Joel, second from right, \"a lot of grief\" as her side emerged victorious\nAs Leicester's lead stretched out in the second half, the volume dipped on the London voices though.\nThe lowing sound of 'C'mon you Quins' and more youthful chanting of star fly-half Marcus Smith's name become less frequent and more quiet.\nOnly 500-odd strong, Harlequins fans were unlikely to break through often, even if the match had been more even.\nBy contrast, Gloucester's fans, congregated in the more sparsely-attended Stonex Stadium for last weekend's first trial match, made their presence felt and voices heard, external with some pithy chants about the deficiencies of London life and Saracens fly-half Fergus Burke.\nWhatever Burke made of it, other players have been supportive of the idea.\nHarlequins flanker Will Evans, who has spoken about the benefits of away support for visiting teams and the league as a whole,, external notably offered up applause to the Quins section.\nLeicester's players also relish focused pockets of support when on the road, according to Pinchen.\nWhether they will see more of it on next season's travels will depend on how Premiership Rugby, who will rebrand the competition for the next campaign, and its clubs' leaders, not all of whom have initially been keen, assess these two experiments.\nJudging by Saturday though, any expansion won't be the radical change to matchday alchemy some traditionalists most feared.\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

        "article_text": "Nat Sciver-Brunt has represented England 259 times across formats\nEngland have appointed all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt as their new captain.\nSciver-Brunt, 32, replaces Heather Knight who spent nine years in the role.\nShe becomes just the fourth permanent England women's captain since 2000.\nKnight was sacked in March as a result of a review into the humiliating 16-0 Ashes defeat earlier in the year.\nHead coach Jon Lewis was also removed from his position and has been replaced by legendary former captain Charlotte Edwards.\n\"I'm really proud to take on the role of captain and it's an honour to have been asked by Charlotte, someone I've always looked up to,\" said Sciver-Brunt.\n\"Ever since I made my England debut back in 2013, all I have wanted to do is help the team in every way that I can. I will try my best to lead this team to success, while empowering them to be the best version of themselves.\n\"We have a really talented group, and we have a group that's united. It's a team I believe in and a team that can have a lot of success together.\"\nSciver-Brunt was the most likely candidate to take over, having been Knight's vice-captain, and is one of England's most experienced all-format cricketers.\nDuring the Ashes, she had stated her desire to fulfil the role when Knight's future remained uncertain, and has previously led England in 11 T20s and once in one-day internationals, with nine of those being wins.\nBut Sciver-Brunt's appointment also felt inevitable considering England's lack of other leadership options, having failed to implement a proper succession plan despite the considerable length of Knight's tenure.\nSpinners Charlie Dean, 24, and Sophie Ecclestone, 25, were other potential candidates but are lacking in captaincy experience.\nEngland's home summer consists of white-ball series against West Indies and India, starting in May, while Sciver-Brunt's first major assignment will be the 50-over World Cup, which takes place in India in September.\nEngland to be 'accountable' for fitness - Edwards\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nWhile Sciver-Brunt's record when stepping in as captain is positive, two of the three defeats have come in highly pressurised situations, again highlighting England's lack of structure without Knight. \nEngland failed to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022 when Knight missed the tournament with a hip injury, and the team's fielding imploded against West Indies during the T20 World Cup in 2024, where they went out at the group stage.\nBut Sciver-Brunt could benefit from the opportunity to lead in her own style rather than simply stepping into Knight's shoes for a brief time, while the partnership with Edwards is likely to be a significant boost. \nThe pair have worked together for Mumbai Indians in the Women's Premier League, where they won the title for the second time last month. \nSciver-Brunt played a starring role as the tournament's leading run-scorer with 523 runs in 10 innings at an average of 65.37, and also took 12 wickets. \nBut there will be concerns around her workload when taking on the captaincy, as England's most important batter and one of their most experienced bowlers.\nSciver-Brunt also recently welcomed her first child, a boy named Theodore, with her wife and former England seamer Katherine. \nAnalysis by Chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt\nFor all the talk of Charlie Dean, Sophie Ecclestone, or even an outsider like Grace Scrivens taking on the England captaincy, it would have been a shock had anyone other than Nat Sciver-Brunt been given the job.\nThe all-rounder was the previous vice-captain, England's best player and said she wanted the job. When added to her existing relationship with head coach Charlotte Edwards, who herself said she wanted a three-format regular in charge, there was only one candidate.\nThere will be concerns about adding extra responsibility to such a vital player, but there were similar worries when Ben Stokes was made men's captain, and that has proved a masterstroke.\nPerhaps a greater worry is how well leadership will sit with Sciver-Brunt, who took a break from cricket in 2022 to focus on her mental health after standing in as captain for the Commonwealth Games.\nThis is where Edwards will come in. It seems likely that the new coach will do a lot of heavy lifting in terms of leadership, tactics and team culture, while Sciver-Brunt will set the example on the field. Their personalities should complement each other nicely.\nIf the appointment of Sciver-Brunt held little mystery, then the squad for the series against West Indies next month should provide more intrigue, especially with England due to appoint a national selector for the first time.\nEdwards, so knowledgeable when it comes to the domestic game here and abroad, will have her own ideas, while those close to the England team have privately spoken about the need for personnel change.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "If one of a pair of twins is allergic to something, does that mean the other twin will be sensitive too?\nAllergies, whether spring sneezes due to pollen or trouble breathing triggered by a certain food, are caused by a combination of someone's genes and the environment they live in. The more of these things two people share, the higher their chances of being allergic to the same things. Twins are more likely to share allergies because of everything they have in common, but the story doesn't end there.\nAllergies are really complex and a lot of factors play a role in who gets them and who doesn't.\nYour immune system makes defence proteins, antibodies, whose job is to keep watch and attack any invading germs or other dangerous substances that get inside your body before they can make you sick.\nAn allergy happens when your body mistakes some usually harmless substance for a harmful intruder. These trigger molecules are allergens. The antibodies stick like suction cups to the allergens, setting off an immune system reaction. That process leads to common allergy symptoms: sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, itchy, watery eyes, and a cough. These symptoms can be annoying but minor.\nAllergies can also cause a life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical attention. For example, if someone ate a food they were allergic to, and then had throat swelling and a rash, that would be considered anaphylaxis.\nThe traditional treatment for anaphylaxis is a shot of the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the leg muscle. Allergy sufferers can also carry\u00a0an auto-injector\u00a0to give themselves an emergency shot in case of a life-threatening case of anaphylaxis. An epinephrine nasal spray is now available, too, which also works very quickly.\nA person can be allergic to things outdoors, like grass or tree pollen and bee stings, or indoors, like pets and tiny bugs called dust mites that hang out in carpets and mattresses.\nA person can also be allergic to foods. Food allergies\u00a0affect 4% to 5% of the population. The most common are to cow's milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish and sesame. Sometimes people\u00a0grow out of allergies, and sometimes they are lifelong.\nEach antibody has a specific target, which is why some people may only be allergic to one thing.\nThe antibodies responsible for allergies also take care of\u00a0cleaning up any parasites\u00a0that your body encounters. Thanks to modern medicine, people in the United States rarely deal with parasites. Those antibodies are still ready to fight, though, and sometimes they misfire at silly things, like pollen or food.\nHygiene and the environment around you can also play a role in how likely it is you'll develop allergies. The\u00a0more different kinds of bacteria\u00a0that you're exposed to earlier in life, the\u00a0less likely you are to develop allergies. Studies have even shown that children who\u00a0grow up on farms, children who have pets\u00a0before the age of five, and children who have a lot of siblings are less likely to develop allergies. Being breastfed as a baby can also\u00a0protect against having allergies.\nChildren who\u00a0grow up in cities\u00a0are more likely to develop allergies, probably due to air pollution, as are children who are\u00a0often around people who smoke.\nChildren are less likely to develop food allergies if they\u00a0try foods early in life\u00a0rather than waiting until they are older. Sometimes a\u00a0certain job can contribute\u00a0to an adult developing environmental allergies. For example, hairdressers, bakers and car mechanics can develop allergies due to chemicals they work with.\nGenetics can also play a huge role in why some people develop allergies. If a parent has environmental or food allergies, their child is more likely to have allergies. Specifically for peanut allergies, if your parent or sibling is allergic to peanuts, you are\u00a0seven times more likely\u00a0to be allergic to peanuts.\nBack to the idea of twins: yes, they can be allergic to the same things, but not always.\nResearchers in Australia found that 60% to 70% of twins in one study\u00a0both had environmental allergies, and identical twins were more likely to share allergies than fraternal (nonidentical) twins. Identical twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins only share about 50% of their genes, the same as any pair of siblings.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Climate change is making allergies worse\n\u2022 Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear with allergies\n\u2022 The science of probiotics and skin\nA lot more research has been done on the genetics of food allergies. One peanut allergy study found that\u00a0identical twins were more likely\u00a0to both be allergic to peanuts than fraternal twins were.\nSo, twins can be allergic to the same things, and it's more likely that they will be, based on their shared genetics and growing up together. But twins aren't automatically allergic to the exact same things.\nImagine if two twins are separated at birth and raised in different homes: one on a farm with pets and one in the inner city. What if one's parents smoke, and the others don't? What if one lives with a lot of siblings and the other is an only child? They certainly could develop different allergies, or maybe not develop allergies at all.\nScientists like me are continuing to research allergies, and we hope to have more answers in the future.\nBreanne Hayes Haney is an immunologist specialising in allergies at West Virginia University in the US.\u00a0\n* This article\u00a0is adapted from a piece that\u00a0originally appeared\u00a0in The Conversation's Curious Kids series, where experts answer questions from children, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, \nsign up for The Essential List newsletter\n \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on \nFacebook\n, \nX \nand \nInstagram\n.

Reports suggest that Ukraine could be asked to give up large portions of land seized by Russia, including Crimea.\nThe BBC has not seen the exact details of the latest US plan. \nOn Friday, Reuters news agency reported that it had seen proposals from the US that included American legal acceptance of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas, including all of Luhansk in the east of the country.\nReuters says it has also seen counter-proposals from Europe and Ukraine, which reportedly say the sides will only discuss what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory once a ceasefire has come into effect. \nThe US plan also rules out Ukraine's membership in the Nato military alliance and sees a UK-France led \"coalition of the willing\" providing a security guarantee once a ceasefire is in force without the involvement of the US. \nMeanwhile the Europeans want the US to give \"robust\" guarantees in the form of a cast-iron Nato-style commitment to come to Ukraine's aid if it is attacked.\nThe US reportedly further proposes to take control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - currently occupied by Russia - which would then provide electricity to both Russia and Ukraine. The counter-plan makes no mention of giving Russia power.\nIn an interview with Time magazine this week, Trump once again blamed Kyiv for starting the war, citing its ambitions of joining Nato.\nThe US president also told Time: \"Crimea will stay with Russia.\"\nOn Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Russia and Ukraine to move forward to secure a peace deal. \n\"It needs to happen soon,\" Rubio told NBC. \"We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it's not going to come to fruition.\"\nThe US has recently warned it would walk away from negotiations if progress was not made. \nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory.",

All occurred in early April.\nThese early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.\nNot all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.\nCertain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.\nSome researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.\n\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".\n\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"\nThe recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.\nBut scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.\nA study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.\nShifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.\n\"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.\n\"We need to be prepared for this to become more common.\"\nAdditional reporting by Phil Leake\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

        "article_text": "Mark Carney's Liberals have won Canada's federal election - riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment to form the next government.\nIt is a stunning political turnaround for a party who were widely considered dead and buried just a few months ago.  \nIt's not yet clear if the party - which has been in power for almost a decade - will be able to secure a majority as results continue to roll in. \nEither way, the prime minister faces major challenges, including divisions in the country laid bare by the campaign. \nHere are five takeaways from an election which saw the Conservative opposition make major gains but still lose. \nThere is no doubt the US president's tariff threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty played an outsized role in this election, suddenly making leadership and the country's economic survival the defining issues of the campaign.\nMark Carney used it to his advantage, running as much against Trump as he did against his main opposition rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.\nCarney warned Canada was at a crisis moment, saying frequently on the campaign trail - and in his victory speech - that Trump \"wants to break us so America can own us\".\nPoilievre brought Trump up much less frequently during the campaign, focusing his message on domestic issues - the cost of living, the housing affordability crisis, and crime - and targeting the Liberals for their record on those matters.\nCarney - who has declared the old relationship with the US \"over\" - plans to start negotiations on a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election.\nKevin O'Leary, a Canadian businessman close to Trump who previously ran for the Conservative leadership, acknowledged it was a successful campaign strategy.\n\"Right now Canadians are very frustrated with America and Carney has used that to his advantage,\" he told the BBC just before polls closed. \"He was able to distract Canadians from his own mistakes... and say 'Stop looking at that. Look south of the border and I can save you'.\"\nAt the start of the year, Carney was a former central banker with no experience as a politician. By mid-March, he was being sworn in as prime minister - the first to have never held elected public office before - after a resounding win in the Liberal leadership race.\nNow, he's faced the Canadian electorate as a first time campaigner, won an Ottawa-area seat in the House of Commons and steered his party to an unlikely victory.\nCarney had long flirted with entering Canadian politics - and he seized his moment, swooping in after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's sudden resignation in January. \nHe also took full advantage of the new political landscape, leaning into his experience helping Canada and the UK navigate previous crises at a time when Canadians were feeling anxious about their economic future.\nTrump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports gave Carney the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign. He was able to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and bringing together his ministers on the US file.\nIn a different election, this would have been a successful one for the Conservatives.\nIn 2011, the Conservatives won a majority with 39.6% of the vote. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is on track to beat that this time, with roughly 41.4% of the vote with most polls reporting, according to Elections Canada.\nThey are currently projected to have won 144 seats - that's up from 120 at dissolution, when the election was called in March.\nBut with the progressive vote coalescing around the Liberals, those numbers weren't enough this time. \nThe bitter blow was Poilievre losing his riding (parliamentary seat) in Carleton, Ontario.\nOnly months ago his party had a clear path to victory and they will now need to figure out a way forward after a series of electoral defeats.\nWhether that includes the diminished figure of Poilievre as leader is the first big question for them to face.He is the third leader they've had since the Liberals swept the 2015 election.\nThe election results have highlighted divisions in Canada that could pose a challenge for Carney. \nNotably, the Liberals are largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan - oil-rich and gas-rich prairie provinces where a sense of alienation from the centre of power in Ottawa has long festered.\nEven before the election, some in those regions were warning of a national unity crisis if the Liberals won another mandate.\nCarney touched on those divisions in his victory speech, acknowledging the millions who had voted for a different outcome. \n\"I intend to govern for all Canadians,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, Poilievre's message, which relentlessly focused on cost of living issues, especially on housing affordability, resonated with many young people.\nSupport for the Conservatives outpaced Liberals by 44% to 31.2% among 18 to 34 year olds, a Nanos poll on 25 April indicated. The divide was more stark among younger men.\nSeparately, Abacus Data polling found that about 18% of 18 to 29 year olds were worried about Trump. That jumped to 45% for voters over 60, suggesting a polarisation on issues between generations. \nOn Monday night, Poilievre remarked on demographic breakthroughs Conservative had made, including with younger Canadians.  \n\"We gave voices to countless people across the country who've been left out and left behind for far too long,\" he said. \nIn this election, the smaller political parties have taken a hit as Canadians choose to park their votes with either the Liberals or the Conservatives - especially the left-wing New Democrats, or NDP. \nSome of the smaller parties have lost a significant amount of vote share - particularly the NDP who have received just 6% of votes counted across Canada so far, compared with 18% in 2021. \nJagmeet Singh, who has been NDP leader for almost eight years, lost his own riding in British Columbia and announced he will step down. \n\"Obviously I know this night is a disappointing night for New Democrats,\" he said, adding: \"We're only defeated if we stop fighting.\"\nThe Greens have also seen their vote share cut in half from 2% to 1%.\nShachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation, told the BBC that Trump's rhetoric was behind the shift to the Liberals.  \n\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters,\" she said.\nThe sovereigntist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have maintained a vote share of around 7%. They are on track to win 23 seats in Quebec. \nThis is based on around 97% of polls reporting.\nCanada doesn't have a two-party system, even though it has historically voted in conservative or liberal governments in some form.\nIn the country's political system, these smaller parties still play a role in Parliament. Both the NDP and the Bloc have at some points formed Official Opposition in the House of Commons.",

Why the Liberals won - and Conservatives lost10 hours agoShareSaveJessica MurphyBBC NewsReporting fromTorontoShareSaveWatch: Liberal Party wins - how Canada's election night unfoldedMark Carney's Liberals have won Canada's federal election - riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment to form the next government.It is a stunning political turnaround for a party who were widely considered dead and buried just a few months ago. Trump's threats became the defining issue There is no doubt the US president's tariff threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty played an outsized role in this election, suddenly making leadership and the country's economic survival the defining issues of the campaign.Mark Carney used it to his advantage, running as much against Trump as he did against his main opposition rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.Carney warned Canada was at a crisis moment, saying frequently on the campaign trail - and in his victory speech - that Trump \"wants to break us so America can own us\".Poilievre brought Trump up much less frequently during the campaign, focusing his message on domestic issues - the cost of living, the housing affordability crisis, and crime - and targeting the Liberals for their record on those matters.Carney - who has declared the old relationship with the US \"over\" - plans to start negotiations on a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election.Kevin O'Leary, a Canadian businessman close to Trump who previously ran for the Conservative leadership, acknowledged it was a successful campaign strategy. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is on track to beat that this time, with roughly 41.4% of the vote with most polls reporting, according to Elections Canada.They are currently projected to have won 144 seats - that's up from 120 at dissolution, when the election was called in March.But with the progressive vote coalescing around the Liberals, those numbers weren't enough this time.

        "article_text": "In Armenia tech education starts early.\nIn a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights.\n\"He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nRobert Sanchez (Chelsea): He's been pretty poor all season and the general consensus is that Chelsea are going to have to change their goalkeeper, but he was very good against Everton. He made three or four decent saves and then was in a position where he could command his box much better than he has done for most of the season.\nKieran Trippier (Newcastle): He was excellent, assured, calm and quality on the ball. At the ripe old age of 34, he is still showing that it's necessary to have experience in the side. He helped Newcastle to manage the game when they went 2-0 up. He showed quality for two of the goals - standing a cross up for Dan Burn and also his corner for Newcastle's third was magnificent.\nCarlos Baleba (Brighton): Brighton will do well to keep hold of Baleba. There are so many levels to go up in his armoury - he is just frightening. He's tall and powerful and his celebration after his last-minute winner wasn't too bad either.\nDan Burn (Newcastle): Burn is the magic man of Newcastle, he just keeps on going. Every time you think his story is doing to drop off, he just keeps getting better. Burn had a real ding-dong with Liam Delap but had the Ipswich forward in his back pocket and then also scored a goal.\nRayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves): It looks to me like he is playing for a move, he looks focused and has the right mindset. His assist for the goal was fantastic but he just continually gets up and down the field. There are only a couple of games left and he still has that burning desire to have an impact.\nAlexis Mac Allister (Liverpool): He has been Liverpool's most consistent midfielder this season. It was a great finish from him, he just looked so calm. The best bit wasn't the goal but it was that he was the standard-setter throughout.\nYasin Ayari (Brighton): He was good and solid but it's all about his goal. What a hit and what a show of technical ability to use Lucas Paqueta who was running at him and just bend it round him.\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves): I'm running out of ways to praise him. He is just at home at Wolves - we know he is leaving but he just looks so comfortable in that side. Wolves know the offer is coming and he just wants to sign off on a positive. He is known as a bit of a maverick and has a wild side but at the moment he has his head screwed on.\nMohamed Salah (Liverpool): He just continues to score goals and had a very decent celebration - a selfie in front the Kop. It's at a time when you think he isn't playing at his full potential too and on a weekend when Liverpool secure the title.\nAntoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): I'm so impressesed every time I watch him. I played against him at Bristol City and didn't think he would be able to go on and do what he's doing in the Premier League, but he is going from strength to strength. Manchester United need to be looking at him - he is powerful and drives, that's what they need.\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle): He could have scored four on the day. His movement and link-up play is excellent. This guy is the complete striker in world football.\nArne Slot (Liverpool): Could it be anyone else on the weekend that he delivers Liverpool a 20th league title? He has come in and only bought Federico Chiesa and turned Liverpool into a title winning team. He's excellent as a manager, excellent in every interview and handles any adversity in the right kind of way.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

Filipinos form one of the largest immigrant groups in the province. \nSo far, very little is known about the identity of those were were killed and wounded in the attack. \nIn a brief news conference on Saturday, acting Vancouver police chief Steve Rai said that men, women and young people were among the victims. \nTheir ages range from five to 65, he added.\nThe attack has deeply affected Vancouver's tight-knit Filipino community. \nRJ Aquino, the head of the Filipino BC organisation, said that \"last night was extremely difficult and the community will feel this for a long time.\"\n\"We know that there's a lot of questions floating about and we don't have all the answers, but we want to tell everybody that we're grieving,\" he added.\nPolice have not yet named the suspect, who they identified only as a 30-year-old resident of the Vancouver area. \nWhile investigators have not confirmed a motive, Rai said that police are confident \"that the evidence in this case does not lead us to believe this was an act of terrorism.\" \nThe suspect, he added, has \"a significant history of interactions with police and healthcare professionals related to mental health\".\nVancouver's mayor, Ken Sim, similarly said that \"mental health appears to be the underlying issue here.\" \nNo further details have been provided on the previous interactions for police, what they entailed or when they took place. \nRai said only that there had not been any interaction with officers in the \"immediate\" lead-up to the attack ",

        "article_text": "The model of football that has come to define our era - often associated with Pep Guardiola, who expanded on what he learned from Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal - is not only the most prominent today, but also the one shaping the present and future of the game.\nGuardiola didn't invent 'juego de posicion' - or positional football - but he developed it further than anyone before him, laying the foundation for a new cultural framework. And whether we like it or not, it has already taken over.\nIndeed, three of Guardiola's disciples - Luis Enrique, Mikel Arteta and Hansi Flick - find themselves in this week's Champions League semi-finals. The Guardiola way will again be on show at the business end of Europe's biggest club competition.\nThere has been growing resistance to this model. Critics argue that it turns players into robots, removes spontaneity and asks defenders to behave like midfielders.\nSome fans and pundits feel it's overcoached, overly structured, and lacking the chaos and excitement of \"real football\".\nBut perhaps that resistance is missing the broader picture - or reacting not to the model itself, but to poor implementations of it.\nLet's look at the facts. Five of the eight Champions League quarter-finalists this season played a version of positional football. Clubs across Europe - even traditional powerhouses like Liverpool and, eventually, Manchester United under Ruben Amorim - are gravitating towards it.\nIt produces brilliant games, particularly in European competition, where elite coaches and players amplify its potential. More than just a style, it's a winning model.\nMost importantly, it's a cultural force. Clubs are hiring managers who believe in it, academies are shaping players to fit it, and football education globally is being reoriented around it.\nNot everyone gets it right. But that's always been true in football. Not every team in the 1970s could play like Nottingham Forest or Liverpool - but many tried, because those styles defined their time. Every era has a prevailing model, and it's natural that most teams move towards it.\nWe're emerging from a footballing culture best summarised as: structured at the back, freedom up front. In other words, we train the defence and leave the attack to the imagination of the forwards.\nThat's changing, but cultural shifts take time. The new footballing paradigm is settling in, but hasn't fully taken hold yet.\nMikel Arteta (left) was Pep Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City\nThe attacking phase can be broken down into three stages: the build-up, the construction and the finishing. The French even refer to an additional phase - the preparation of the final pass - which sits between construction and finishing. But for the purpose of this discussion, let's stick with three.\nWhen Guardiola began coaching in 2001, his focus was on the build-up phase. The famous conversation with Victor Valdes, in which Valdes thought his manager had gone mad for asking him to pass to centre-backs who didn't want the ball, is now part of football folklore. A landmark moment in the evolution of the game.\nAfter the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, and especially following the rule change in 2019 that allowed players to receive the ball from a goal-kick from inside the penalty area, training the build-up phase became not just common practice, but a fundamental pillar of modern football.\nThe construction phase - managing the middle third - has taken longer to spread, but Guardiola had already started developing it at Barcelona, and refined it further at Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\nThe finishing phase, however - the final act of an attacking move - remains largely unorganised. Football still hasn't figured out how to fully systematise it. The culture of the game, among players and coaches alike, isn't quite ready for it. But one day, a new revolutionary will come along and advance that final phase. That's the history of football.\nFor now, we have brilliant practitioners perfecting the model as it stands - as well as the three semi-finalists, Unai Emery and even Enzo Maresca are two more. Roberto de Zerbi had started to push the boundaries, but his progress has stalled.\n\"Pep has been a reference for all of us who want to play football in a certain way\u2026 You always learn by watching his teams play. Always,\" said Paris St-Germain manager Luis Enrique.\n\"Working alongside him changed the way I see football. He gave me the tools to be a coach,\" said Arsenal's Arteta.\n\"Pep influenced me a lot. He has an incredible ability to organise the game, to control space and to constantly find new solutions. Watching him train Bayern was an eye-opener. He's one of the greatest thinkers football has ever had,\" added Barcelona's Flick.\nLuis Enrique's PSG beat Pep Guardiola's Manchester City 4-2 in this season's Champions League\nMuch of the criticism towards positional football is rooted in frustration: \"If we can't do it well, let's not do it at all.\"\nBut that's not how progress works. Just because only the top teams can currently execute the model exceptionally well doesn't mean it's flawed. It means we're watching football in transition. The conversation shouldn't be \"this doesn't work\", rather \"how can we implement it better?\"\nIt's easy to romanticise the past, to argue that football used to be more spontaneous, more human. But the truth is football today is better. More complex, more collective, more intelligently designed. It's harder to coach, harder to play and, when done well, arguably more beautiful to watch.\nThat's why managers like Emery are so fascinating. He challenged his own beliefs, read the evolution of the game and adapted. He embraced positional principles not because of ideology, but because they offered greater control, clarity and consistency - even without elite-level players.\nThat kind of flexibility is brave. Not every manager can do it. Not every player can either. But I admire clubs that choose to live in the now, rather than clinging to what worked then.\nWhy shouldn't defenders like Virgil van Dijk, Pau Torres or Pau Cubarsi touch the ball more than midfielders? Why can't they be the architects of the play? Why can't they be the role models for a new generation of defenders?\nEven PSG, a club historically reliant on individual brilliance, has adopted positional ideas in attack - making sure they're prepared to press the instant they lose the ball.\nThe hardest thing in football, as in life, is to look forward and imagine what's next. It's far easier to look back and say \"that was better\".\nI don't pretend to know what football will look like in a decade. But I listen to those who do. And I believe positional play is the present - and the future.\nWe are in the middle of a cultural shift. Some managers are trying to copy the model. Some are succeeding. Others are still learning. And yes, some are resisting altogether.\nBut in five years almost everyone will be playing some version of positional football. Not because they'll be forced to, but because football doesn't wait for those who refuse to evolve.\nThe next generation of coaches is already fluent in its language. And soon it will be universal.\nWe're not asking every restaurant to be Michelin-starred. But we are asking them to stop serving frozen food.\nLet's not fight the model. Let's enjoy the process. Let's celebrate the teams trying to get it right - mixing structure with their own cultural identity - instead of dismissing them because they're not Guardiola's City.\nA new football culture has taken over - and it's here to stay.\nThis video can not be played\n'PSG worry me more than Real Madrid'\nA beautiful story but we want much more - Arteta\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

I don't think I want to say a lot. The only thing now is to send my appreciation to Jurgen Klopp,\" Slot, who replaced Klopp as Liverpool manager last summer, told LFCTV.\nThe 46-year-old immediately launched into a rendition of the song Klopp asked Liverpool fans to sing after his final game last May, but replaced the lyrics 'Arne Slot' with 'Jurgen Klopp'.\n\"I am 99.9% sure that if I pick up my phone there will be a message from Jurgen,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"So many moments in the season the two of us have had contact. I think he showed last season what a wonderful human being he is by introducing me. \n\"But what mattered most is the team he left behind that was able to win the trophy.\"\nSlot, speaking to Sky Sports, added: \"The work Jurgen and Pep [Lijnders] did - the culture, work-rate, quality - was outstanding,\"\nThis video can not be played\nCommentary cam scenes as Liverpool win title\nFew expected Slot to oversee a successful title charge in his first season at Anfield, not least the man himself.\n\"We started really well and maybe it helped that [Manchester] City had a difficult spell that they have not had in five years,\" he said.\n\"When the season started, we would have been happy with top four. But I don't think that is fair on the players as they are much better than that and they have shown it this season.\"\nDominic Solanke gave Spurs a surprise lead at Anfield, but Slot had no doubts his side would turn things around.\n\"I think from the moment we arrived on the bus everyone could feel that we were never going to lose this game,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"The fans were so supportive before and during the game. Even at 1-0 down you felt this team and the fans could get it over the line.\"\nHe told LFCTV: \"They always find a way to win.

The feeling is unbelievable. The first time was lockdown and the pandemic, but to be here five years later is incredible.\"\nSalah told Sky Sports: \"This is 100% better than last time.\"\nVirgil van Dijk - the first non-British captain to lead Liverpool to a top flight title - dedicated the triumph to the club's supporters.\n\"I was desperate to win it for them [the fans] and all the fans around the world, and for us as well,\" Van Dijk told Sky Sports.\n\"This is the most beautiful club in the world.

We enjoyed it of course but you cannot beat what we experienced today. Nothing compares to that.\n\"It is special. For me, when I came to this club I quickly realised how good Scottish players have been here. There is a bit of pressure with that. I am glad I managed to continue that and hopefully can carry that forward.\"\nIt has been a remarkable few years for midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, who won the 2022 World Cup with Argentina before joining Liverpool in 2023.\n\"To win a World Cup and now a Premier League is really special,\" he said. \n\"But it would not be possible without my team-mates.

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

In a match where they had been under the cosh for large spells, the home side now led 19-12.But Ireland were undeterred and continued to put pressure on Scotland, most notably at scrum time.The home side were barely back to their full complement when they lost another player to a yellow card, this time Helen Nelson for an infringement at a ruck as the Scots became more desperate in their defence of their try line.The pressure eventually told when substitute Lane dived over and O'Brien slotted over the conversion to make it all square again.There was one final twist when McGhie went over in the corner to pull a victory out the fire at the end of a breathless contest.Related topicsScottish RugbyIrish RugbyRugby Union",

        "article_text": "In the midst of \"the car capital of the world\", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.\nHome to the \"Motor City\" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called \"the car capital of the world\". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Days after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar at the end of March, killing at least 3,700 people, the country's ruling junta agreed to a halt in its devastating military campaign.\nIt then violated that ceasefire, again and again.\nI went inside rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state for 10 days from mid-April. I witnessed daily violations by the junta, including rocket and mortar attacks which killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters.\nOne of those was Khala, a 45-year-old father killed in a strike by military warplanes, in a place his wife Mala said should have been safe.\nWhen the ceasefire was announced, on 2 April, Mala and Khala sensed an opportunity to return to their home for the first time in years.\nWith their four-year-old child, they headed from the camp where they'd taken refuge to their village, Pekin Coco. They found it abandoned, with buildings shattered from drawn-out fighting. Almost everyone there had moved to farmland further away from the junta's weapons.\nBut as the young family was about to leave Pekin Coco again, their car loaded with their possessions, the shelling started.\n\"We were all at the front of the house. Then, shells landed near us. We hid at the back of the house. But he [Khala] stayed where he was,\" said Mala. \"The artillery shell landed and exploded near him. He died in the place where he thought he was safe.\n\"He was a good man,\" she said and began to cry.\nLater that afternoon, the junta's warplanes attacked a house on the same street, killing four more men.\n\"I hate them,\" Mala said. \"They always attack people without reason. I don't feel safe here. Jet fighters are flying over the sky often but there is no place to hide.\"\nMala is 31 and seven months pregnant. When we spoke she was back in a displaced people's camp, grieving. Her son Zoe, missing his father, wouldn't leave her side.\nBefore the earthquake, Myanmar was in the midst of a nationwide civil war.\nAfter decades of military rule and brutal repression, ethnic groups, along with a new army of young insurgents, brought the dictatorship to crisis point. As much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the resistance.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed, including many children, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The UN says the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, some 2.5 million were already displaced before the quake.\nKarenni, or Kayah, state is far from the earthquake's epicentre. Its remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Its thick jungle provides cover for those who oppose military rule, but it is difficult to get around, the roads are poor and main highways remain in range of the army's guns. Most of the state is now controlled by rebel and armed ethnic groups.\nOn 28 March when the quake hit, there were no reported deaths in Karenni - but the hospitals still filled quickly with people suffering spinal and crush injuries.\nA 30m (100ft) sinkhole had appeared in the forests around the town of Demoso. Locals who heard the ground open up thought it was another air strike. For many weeks, the sinkhole continued to expand with the aftershocks.\nThe UN noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end. The State Administration Council, the ruling junta, has not commented on the alleged violations but has claimed that it was attacked by resistance groups. During the ceasefire all sides in the conflict have reserved the right to respond if attacked.\nDuring my 10 days in Mobeye, Karenni, I witnessed daily attacks by the junta.\nI met Stefano there, a 23-year-old fighting the military dictatorship with the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF).\nHe leads a platoon of young fighters who have set up trenches around the base.\nFrom a dugout just 100m (330ft) from the junta's positions, he explained the army had continued attacks \"using all means\" during the ceasefire - soldiers on the ground, drones and jets.\n\"They usually attack with drones and heavy artillery on this side. When it rains, they advance by taking advantage of the weather.\"\nHe called the ceasefire a \"joke\". \n\"We did not believe the military council from the beginning. We don't believe it now, and we won't believe it in the future.\"\nThe day after we spoke, the military launched a full-scale assault with heavy weapons and men, attacking rebel lines. As we made our way to the front lines, small-arms fire could be heard nearby, along with mortar strikes. The ground was pitted with fresh hits from armed drones.\nNearby lay the corpse of a junta fighter who had tried to breach the rebel positions. The resistance forces say they have suspended all offensive activities during the ceasefire, but they have said they will respond if attacked. Yi Shui, the commander of another resistance group, the Karenni National Army, showed me pictures on his phone. \"When we saw them, we shot them. One of them got hit\" and another ran away, he said.\nAnd again, the military wasn't just targeting the resistance forces. Its rockets hit farmland beyond, killing a 60-year-old woman. We arrived at fields where four rockets had landed, children were playing with the bent metal and shrapnel from the strikes.\nThe injured were taken to local hospitals, which are hidden deep in the jungle to avoid air strikes from junta warplanes.\nIn one, a young fighter was being treated in a wooden ward with a dirt floor. He had a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and was losing a lot of blood.\nThe doctor in charge, 32-year-old Thi Ha Tun, said he'd treated around a dozen patients for war-related injuries since the ceasefire was declared. Two of the patients, resistance fighters, died.\nHe dismissed what he called the junta's lies. \"They only care about their own interests,\" he said. \"They will only care about their own organisation. They will not care about the rest of this country, their own generation, the youth, the children, the elderly, anything.\"\nThe only solution is to keep fighting, he said.\nHigh on a hilltop in the rebel-controlled areas is the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The earthquake brought down the church steeple and part of the roof. The bell from Rome now sits in a temporary cradle. Repairs have been made, but the church will probably need to be rebuilt.\nThey are still feeling the aftershocks here weeks later.\nBut for Father Philip, the local priest, the greatest threat to his congregation, many of whom are the war displaced, comes from above, not below.\n\"No place is safe. When we have jet fighters flying in the sky\u2026 you never know what will come falling from the sky.\"\nBack at the Mobeye front, Stefano and his men pass the hours between attacks, cleaning their weapons and singing songs. \"I can hear the people's prayers, cries, and cries. We will overthrow the dictatorship,\" they sing in unison. They say the only ceasefire they will trust will come with the junta's defeat. \nThe truce will finish at the end of the month, but for most of the people here, it's as if it never existed at all.",

Replacement hooker Jack Singleton scored a 27-minute short-range hat-trick. \nThe red-zone ruthlessness that defined the Chiefs in their domestic and European double five years ago was turned against them as their flimsy defence recorded only 66% tackle success, the joint-lowest of any team this weekend.\nChairman Tony Rowe, who has seen the member-owned club rise from the English second tier to the top of the club game, went into the away dressing room to outline just how far off those heights the current team has fallen.\n\"Tony is entirely entitled to come in there and fire into everybody,\" Exeter head coach Rob Hunter said.\n\"He puts a lot of time and effort into the club, and his expectations and everyone else's expectations should be way, way higher than that.\"\nFord has 99 England caps but is yet to tour with the British and Irish Lions\nWith the British and Irish Lions squad to be announced on 8 May, this was the final round of Premiership games for contenders to press their case.\nNorthampton's Alex Mitchell and Gloucester's Tomos Williams, both leading scrum-half candidates, burnished their chances with excellent showings in victory.\nPerhaps most intriguing, though, was Lions assistant coach Richard Wigglesworth's presence at Sale's win over Saracens.\nGeorge Ford will hope his former Leicester and England team-mate was in his seat promptly.\nFord sliced through Saracens' defence twice in the opening 90 seconds to set up Rekeiti Ma'asi-White's opening score.\nWith Finn Russell, Sam Prendergast, Fin Smith and Marcus Smith in the mix, the 32-year-old would have to weave through similarly heavy traffic to make his first Lions tour, but he has a big advocate in Sale coach Alex Sanderson.\n\"People have put other fly-halves ahead of him because of their attacking, game-breaking prowess,\" said Sanderson.\n\"But I think he showed tonight that he's got that in his game as well - what can't he do?\n\"Are there three better fly-halves in Britain and Ireland than George?

        "article_text": "As Romania's bear population grows, so do the opportunities for travellers to come face to face with the predators in a responsible way.\nRomania is home to the largest population of wild brown bears in Europe outside of Russia, with as many as 13,000 bears living in and around the largely untouched forests of the Carpathian Mountains. But while bear-spotting has long been a tourist attraction in Romania, it historically didn't involve venturing into the forest.\n\"It wasn't that long ago that it was commonplace to see a bear kept in a cage outside of businesses here to attract customers,\" host Reece Parkinson explained in a recent episode of BBC's The Travel Show.\nWhen Romania joined the European Union in 2007, the country began to adhere to the EU Zoos Directive, which issues guidelines for how captive animals are to be treated. In the past 18 years, the country has turned to more humane and sustainable ways to show off one of Europe's last truly wild corners and the brown bears who thrive here.\nBrown bears have roamed the woods and mountains of Europe for millions of years. However, their numbers dwindled significantly as human civilisation expanded. Today, it's estimated that roughly 36,000 bears live in the European part of Russia, but new research conducted by Romania's Forestry Research Institute reveals that the nation's brown bear population is much higher than previously estimated \u2013 a fact that has brought both opportunity and challenges to surrounding communities.\nOn one hand, sustainable bear tourism in Romania is growing. Numerous tour operators like\u00a0Outdoor Holidays\u00a0and\u00a0Much Better Adventures\u00a0now offer visitors guided \"bear-sighting\" hiking trips into the forests where brown bears live. This, in turn, also brings economic opportunities to the country's more rural communities and encourages continued conservation of the animals' habitat.\nThere's even a dedicated safe haven:\u00a0Libearty Bear Sanctuary,\u00a0nestled in the southern Carpathian Mountains in the town of Zarnesti, is the world's largest brown bear sanctuary. It not only rescues and provides medical care to formerly captive bears who can't be released into the wild, but also offers public tours, allowing visitors them to see the bears in a 69-hectare expanse of oak forests and grasslands.\u00a0\n\"In the last 20 years, Cristina Lapis and her team [at Libearty Bear Sanctuary] have given a home to over 130 bears here in Transylvania,\" said Parkinson.\nUnfortunately, not everyone is enthusiastic about their furry neighbours. As the bear population flourishes, so do dangerous encounters with humans.\nSome local farmers, many of whom have lost livestock to the bears, have lobbied for culling Romania's brown bear population. Visitors have also had conflicts with the animals, often because of unexpected encounters while hiking the mountains \u2013\u00a0several of which have\u00a0turned deadly. Still Lapis, who runs the sanctuary, insists that such encounters are not the norm.\u00a0\n\"I know hundreds of thousands of cases where people who are used to the forest saw a bear and nothing happened. So [there] must be something special that an accident happened,\" said Lapis. \"When you go in the forest\u2026 it's important to make noise. If you make noise the animal knows you're coming and goes away.\"\nEfforts are underway to try to find a happy medium that protects the bears and keeps visitors and livestock as safe as possible. The animals are protected under Romanian law, and reforestation and educational efforts are underway to prevent the bears from entering into human territory to feed and to teach humans what to do when they encounter a bear in the woods.\u00a0 \u00a0\nMost life-threatening encounters with bears are due to human error, usually when a human startles a bear or interacts inappropriately with cubs, making mother bears defensive. Therefore, when hiking in bear country \u2013 whether in Romania or elsewhere \u2013 it's important to talk loudly or clap your hands to give the animals time to avoid you. If you come upon a bear accidentally, make yourself as large as possible and back away. \u00a0\u00a0\n\"We cannot live alone [in the wilderness],\" Lapis said. \"We have to learn to share.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0\u00a0",

        "article_text": "If one of a pair of twins is allergic to something, does that mean the other twin will be sensitive too?\nAllergies, whether spring sneezes due to pollen or trouble breathing triggered by a certain food, are caused by a combination of someone's genes and the environment they live in. The more of these things two people share, the higher their chances of being allergic to the same things. Twins are more likely to share allergies because of everything they have in common, but the story doesn't end there.\nAllergies are really complex and a lot of factors play a role in who gets them and who doesn't.\nYour immune system makes defence proteins, antibodies, whose job is to keep watch and attack any invading germs or other dangerous substances that get inside your body before they can make you sick.\nAn allergy happens when your body mistakes some usually harmless substance for a harmful intruder. These trigger molecules are allergens. The antibodies stick like suction cups to the allergens, setting off an immune system reaction. That process leads to common allergy symptoms: sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, itchy, watery eyes, and a cough. These symptoms can be annoying but minor.\nAllergies can also cause a life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical attention. For example, if someone ate a food they were allergic to, and then had throat swelling and a rash, that would be considered anaphylaxis.\nThe traditional treatment for anaphylaxis is a shot of the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the leg muscle. Allergy sufferers can also carry\u00a0an auto-injector\u00a0to give themselves an emergency shot in case of a life-threatening case of anaphylaxis. An epinephrine nasal spray is now available, too, which also works very quickly.\nA person can be allergic to things outdoors, like grass or tree pollen and bee stings, or indoors, like pets and tiny bugs called dust mites that hang out in carpets and mattresses.\nA person can also be allergic to foods. Food allergies\u00a0affect 4% to 5% of the population. The most common are to cow's milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish and sesame. Sometimes people\u00a0grow out of allergies, and sometimes they are lifelong.\nEach antibody has a specific target, which is why some people may only be allergic to one thing.\nThe antibodies responsible for allergies also take care of\u00a0cleaning up any parasites\u00a0that your body encounters. Thanks to modern medicine, people in the United States rarely deal with parasites. Those antibodies are still ready to fight, though, and sometimes they misfire at silly things, like pollen or food.\nHygiene and the environment around you can also play a role in how likely it is you'll develop allergies. The\u00a0more different kinds of bacteria\u00a0that you're exposed to earlier in life, the\u00a0less likely you are to develop allergies. Studies have even shown that children who\u00a0grow up on farms, children who have pets\u00a0before the age of five, and children who have a lot of siblings are less likely to develop allergies. Being breastfed as a baby can also\u00a0protect against having allergies.\nChildren who\u00a0grow up in cities\u00a0are more likely to develop allergies, probably due to air pollution, as are children who are\u00a0often around people who smoke.\nChildren are less likely to develop food allergies if they\u00a0try foods early in life\u00a0rather than waiting until they are older. Sometimes a\u00a0certain job can contribute\u00a0to an adult developing environmental allergies. For example, hairdressers, bakers and car mechanics can develop allergies due to chemicals they work with.\nGenetics can also play a huge role in why some people develop allergies. If a parent has environmental or food allergies, their child is more likely to have allergies. Specifically for peanut allergies, if your parent or sibling is allergic to peanuts, you are\u00a0seven times more likely\u00a0to be allergic to peanuts.\nBack to the idea of twins: yes, they can be allergic to the same things, but not always.\nResearchers in Australia found that 60% to 70% of twins in one study\u00a0both had environmental allergies, and identical twins were more likely to share allergies than fraternal (nonidentical) twins. Identical twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins only share about 50% of their genes, the same as any pair of siblings.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Climate change is making allergies worse\n\u2022 Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear with allergies\n\u2022 The science of probiotics and skin\nA lot more research has been done on the genetics of food allergies. One peanut allergy study found that\u00a0identical twins were more likely\u00a0to both be allergic to peanuts than fraternal twins were.\nSo, twins can be allergic to the same things, and it's more likely that they will be, based on their shared genetics and growing up together. But twins aren't automatically allergic to the exact same things.\nImagine if two twins are separated at birth and raised in different homes: one on a farm with pets and one in the inner city. What if one's parents smoke, and the others don't? What if one lives with a lot of siblings and the other is an only child? They certainly could develop different allergies, or maybe not develop allergies at all.\nScientists like me are continuing to research allergies, and we hope to have more answers in the future.\nBreanne Hayes Haney is an immunologist specialising in allergies at West Virginia University in the US.\u00a0\n* This article\u00a0is adapted from a piece that\u00a0originally appeared\u00a0in The Conversation's Curious Kids series, where experts answer questions from children, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, \nsign up for The Essential List newsletter\n \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on \nFacebook\n, \nX \nand \nInstagram\n.

        "article_text": "Days after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar at the end of March, killing at least 3,700 people, the country's ruling junta agreed to a halt in its devastating military campaign.\nIt then violated that ceasefire, again and again.\nI went inside rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state for 10 days from mid-April. I witnessed daily violations by the junta, including rocket and mortar attacks which killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters.\nOne of those was Khala, a 45-year-old father killed in a strike by military warplanes, in a place his wife Mala said should have been safe.\nWhen the ceasefire was announced, on 2 April, Mala and Khala sensed an opportunity to return to their home for the first time in years.\nWith their four-year-old child, they headed from the camp where they'd taken refuge to their village, Pekin Coco. They found it abandoned, with buildings shattered from drawn-out fighting. Almost everyone there had moved to farmland further away from the junta's weapons.\nBut as the young family was about to leave Pekin Coco again, their car loaded with their possessions, the shelling started.\n\"We were all at the front of the house. Then, shells landed near us. We hid at the back of the house. But he [Khala] stayed where he was,\" said Mala. \"The artillery shell landed and exploded near him. He died in the place where he thought he was safe.\n\"He was a good man,\" she said and began to cry.\nLater that afternoon, the junta's warplanes attacked a house on the same street, killing four more men.\n\"I hate them,\" Mala said. \"They always attack people without reason. I don't feel safe here. Jet fighters are flying over the sky often but there is no place to hide.\"\nMala is 31 and seven months pregnant. When we spoke she was back in a displaced people's camp, grieving. Her son Zoe, missing his father, wouldn't leave her side.\nBefore the earthquake, Myanmar was in the midst of a nationwide civil war.\nAfter decades of military rule and brutal repression, ethnic groups, along with a new army of young insurgents, brought the dictatorship to crisis point. As much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the resistance.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed, including many children, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The UN says the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, some 2.5 million were already displaced before the quake.\nKarenni, or Kayah, state is far from the earthquake's epicentre. Its remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Its thick jungle provides cover for those who oppose military rule, but it is difficult to get around, the roads are poor and main highways remain in range of the army's guns. Most of the state is now controlled by rebel and armed ethnic groups.\nOn 28 March when the quake hit, there were no reported deaths in Karenni - but the hospitals still filled quickly with people suffering spinal and crush injuries.\nA 30m (100ft) sinkhole had appeared in the forests around the town of Demoso. Locals who heard the ground open up thought it was another air strike. For many weeks, the sinkhole continued to expand with the aftershocks.\nThe UN noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end. The State Administration Council, the ruling junta, has not commented on the alleged violations but has claimed that it was attacked by resistance groups. During the ceasefire all sides in the conflict have reserved the right to respond if attacked.\nDuring my 10 days in Mobeye, Karenni, I witnessed daily attacks by the junta.\nI met Stefano there, a 23-year-old fighting the military dictatorship with the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF).\nHe leads a platoon of young fighters who have set up trenches around the base.\nFrom a dugout just 100m (330ft) from the junta's positions, he explained the army had continued attacks \"using all means\" during the ceasefire - soldiers on the ground, drones and jets.\n\"They usually attack with drones and heavy artillery on this side. When it rains, they advance by taking advantage of the weather.\"\nHe called the ceasefire a \"joke\". \n\"We did not believe the military council from the beginning. We don't believe it now, and we won't believe it in the future.\"\nThe day after we spoke, the military launched a full-scale assault with heavy weapons and men, attacking rebel lines. As we made our way to the front lines, small-arms fire could be heard nearby, along with mortar strikes. The ground was pitted with fresh hits from armed drones.\nNearby lay the corpse of a junta fighter who had tried to breach the rebel positions. The resistance forces say they have suspended all offensive activities during the ceasefire, but they have said they will respond if attacked. Yi Shui, the commander of another resistance group, the Karenni National Army, showed me pictures on his phone. \"When we saw them, we shot them. One of them got hit\" and another ran away, he said.\nAnd again, the military wasn't just targeting the resistance forces. Its rockets hit farmland beyond, killing a 60-year-old woman. We arrived at fields where four rockets had landed, children were playing with the bent metal and shrapnel from the strikes.\nThe injured were taken to local hospitals, which are hidden deep in the jungle to avoid air strikes from junta warplanes.\nIn one, a young fighter was being treated in a wooden ward with a dirt floor. He had a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and was losing a lot of blood.\nThe doctor in charge, 32-year-old Thi Ha Tun, said he'd treated around a dozen patients for war-related injuries since the ceasefire was declared. Two of the patients, resistance fighters, died.\nHe dismissed what he called the junta's lies. \"They only care about their own interests,\" he said. \"They will only care about their own organisation. They will not care about the rest of this country, their own generation, the youth, the children, the elderly, anything.\"\nThe only solution is to keep fighting, he said.\nHigh on a hilltop in the rebel-controlled areas is the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The earthquake brought down the church steeple and part of the roof. The bell from Rome now sits in a temporary cradle. Repairs have been made, but the church will probably need to be rebuilt.\nThey are still feeling the aftershocks here weeks later.\nBut for Father Philip, the local priest, the greatest threat to his congregation, many of whom are the war displaced, comes from above, not below.\n\"No place is safe. When we have jet fighters flying in the sky\u2026 you never know what will come falling from the sky.\"\nBack at the Mobeye front, Stefano and his men pass the hours between attacks, cleaning their weapons and singing songs. \"I can hear the people's prayers, cries, and cries. We will overthrow the dictatorship,\" they sing in unison. They say the only ceasefire they will trust will come with the junta's defeat. \nThe truce will finish at the end of the month, but for most of the people here, it's as if it never existed at all.",

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack.

Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

Hope and fear as tourists trickle back to Kashmir town after attack5 hours agoShareSaveRaghvendra RaoBBC Hindi, PahalgamNikhil InamdarBBC News, LondonShareSaveSeraj AliSome tourists decided to stay back in Pahalgam because flight tickets back home were expensiveOne week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. \"Seraj AliIndian authorities have launched combing operations in Kashmir and destroyed homes belonging to alleged militants The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. \"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.TourismAsiaKashmir tensionsIndiaKashmir",

        "article_text": "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia.\nOutside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins.\nHome to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.\nFor Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.\nRunning the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.\nBurnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.\nStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.\nA once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.\nAs a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\nHealth has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.\nBut experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.\nAustralians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.\nHealthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.\nSeeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.\nThough she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.\n\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"\nWhen Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".\nHealth funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.\nPatients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.\nMedicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.\nFast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.\nThere is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.\nBut the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.\nThat is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.\nAccording to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.\nBut experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.\nBrisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.\n\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"\nAnd every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.\n\"[I] just can't keep up.\"\nThis is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. \nSo his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?\nThis year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.\nThe results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"\nAnd that's just primary care.\nPublic specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.\nThere are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.\nThe BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.\nOthers are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.\nKimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.\n\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.\n\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"\nAnother woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.\n\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.\nThe people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.\n\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.\nAll of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.\nEvery single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.\nStreaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.\nIt's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.\n\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.\n\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"\nShe came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.\nIt's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.\n\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.\nWhen the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.\nIt means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.\n\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.\nLike many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.\nThere's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.\nMany doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.\nHealth economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.\nThe taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.\n\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"\nThe original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.\nShe says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. \nBoth the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.\n\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.\nOn the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.\nHis government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.\nBut the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. \nProposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.\nOne Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.\nLabor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".\nBut many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. \nThere's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.\nExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.\nThat is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.\nAnd the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.\n\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.\nIn Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.\n\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.\n\"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\"",

        "article_text": "Jurgen Klopp won his first trophy at Liverpool with their 2019 Champions League final victory\nWhen Jurgen Klopp announced he would be leaving Liverpool in January 2024 it came as a shock to the football world.\nEmotions were high after his final game in charge at Anfield last May and, along with the tears that were shed, there was concern and uncertainty among Reds fans about what the following season would hold under new manager Arne Slot.\nThey needn't have worried. Slot has led Liverpool to a 20th league title.\nBut, while the Dutchman has been the mastermind behind Liverpool's campaign this season, his success - as he highlighted following his team's confirmation as champions on Sunday - is also due to the squad and culture created by Klopp.\nThe Reds only added one player to their ranks for this campaign in Federico Chiesa and, despite him only playing a bit-part role, they have equalled the title tally of arch-rivals Manchester United.\nBBC Sport - through a documentary on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the Champions League in 2018-2019 - charts how Klopp ended up with the Reds and how he created the foundations for Slot to build on.\nWhen Liverpool were looking for a manager to replace Brendan Rodgers, the \"two main candidates\" - according to former Reds director of research Ian Graham - were Klopp and Carlo Ancelotti, who were both out of work at the time.\nAncelotti was a \"great coach\" but Liverpool didn't have the \"sort of squad\" with \"proven superstars\" that he was used to managing.\nKlopp, on the other hand, had guided a youthful Borussia Dortmund side to the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012 and was seen as a better fit.\n\"Our strategy was to recruit young players, have them reach peak age together to give us this success one or two years down the line,\" said Graham.\nKlopp was appointed as Reds boss with the club 10th in the Premier League in October 2015, and he set about instilling a philosophy and principles at the Anfield club which Slot has benefitted from.\n\"We always wanted to create stories which we can tell our grandkids,\" said Peter Krawietz, who had been with Klopp at Mainz and Dortmund before following him to Liverpool and becoming his assistant.\n\"There's only one way. Do it as a team. Do it with your mates.\n\"Use that to make sure we are feeling like friends, like brothers, like a family.

It was constantly learning without changing our basic ideas until the end.\"\nHe added: \"We, as the managing staff, were convinced about our way.\n\"We had to convince the players as well and then, the next step is to convince the people around, turning doubters into believers.\"\nKrawietz admitted Klopp's gameplan could be \"wild\" but \"was part of the plan\", and there was no better evidence of it in action than their 2019 Champions League semi-final against Lionel Messi's Barcelona.\nThe Reds looked down and out after losing the first leg 3-0 at the Nou Camp, before what turned out to be one of the most memorable comebacks in Champions League history.\n\"Right after the first game, there was a very decisive moment in the dressing room because Jurgen stood up and said, 'hey, gentlemen, this game is not over yet. We have half-time. Yes, we are 3-0 down, but we are Liverpool and we play next week in our stadium',\" said Krawietz.\n\"For us, football is always playing football as well with your heart. \n\"All the strategy, all the tactics, all the instructions you give to them but, giving the team the possibility to feel the game and the energy of a stadium, the support of each other and bringing the crowd into the game as well in home games, which is possible at Anfield, we knew it and this is what we tried to develop.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'It's like a father hugging the son' - Alisson and Robertson on Klopp's hugs\nLiverpool's in-house data department had given them a 3.5% chance of overcoming Barcelona before the second leg but, as the injured Mohamed Salah's T-shirt read before the match, Klopp's Liverpool 'never give up'.\nDivock Origi pulled one goal back early on for Liverpool and two from Georginio Wijnaldum, who was \"angry like crazy\" at not having started, levelled the tie at 3-3 before 'that' corner.\nWith Barcelona still getting organised for a Liverpool corner, Trent Alexander-Arnold pretended to walk away from the ball before quickly turning and sending in a low ball which Origi swept in to cause scenes of bedlam as Liverpool won 4-0.\n\"I didn't know at the time but our video analysts pay a lot of attention to set-pieces,\" said Graham.\n\"They noticed that this was a recurring theme - when Barcelona concede a corner they are more concerned with arguing amongst themselves than they are defending the corner - and so Divock and Trent had been briefed.\n\"Credit to the video analysts and Trent and Divock for spotting the opportunity and converting it as well.\"\nLiverpool went on to beat Spurs and win Europe's top competition for a sixth time.\n\"It's not hard to play for Jurgen.

        "article_text": "The government ended a wave of public sector strikes last summer when it accepted, in full, the recommendations of independent public sector pay review bodies to increase the pay of teachers, nurses and others.\nBut ministers might be facing another headache over pay and the possibility of a fresh threat of strikes from some unions.\nBBC Verify examines why this pressure over public sector pay and industrial action has re-emerged.\nIn July 2024, the new Labour government accepted the recommendations of these bodies to increase public sector pay by between 4.75% and 6% for the 2024-25 financial year.\nThere is a new round of recommendations from these bodies every year and they traditionally deliver in the summer.\nIn September 2024, the government decided to speed up the process by asking for their recommendations by the spring for how much public sector pay should rise in each sector in the 2025-26 financial year.\nThese have not been made public yet, but reports suggest the recommendations are for more than the health and education departments have budgeted for this financial year.\nIn their own submissions to the pay review bodies, the health and education departments said they could only afford to increase their pay bills in England by 2.8%.\nThe BBC has been told that the teachers' pay review body has recommended a 4% rise and the NHS body has recommended 3%.\nIn the case of teachers, this would be above the latest 3.2% consumer price inflation forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility for 2025-26.\nBecause education and health are devolved, the health and education departments set budgets for spending in England only. The teachers' pay review body makes recommendations for England only but the NHS pay review body covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Public sector pay is set through a separate process in Scotland.\nThe recommendation of an above-inflation pay rise for teachers is likely to be because of ongoing concerns about staff recruitment and retention in schools.\nThese have been raised in previous pay recommendations. \nCalculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) show that, despite the 5.5% average cash pay rise teachers received in 2024-25, the average pay of most teachers in that year - when adjusted for inflation - was still lower than than it was back in 2010.\nIn the case of the most experienced teachers, pay was 9% lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms.\nOfficial government data also shows widening gaps between the recruitment figures for teachers in specific subjects and their recruitment targets.\nJust 17% of the target for secondary school physics teacher recruitment was achieved in 2023-24, down from 42% in 2019-20.\nOverall teacher recruitment was 62% of the target, down from 87% in 2019-20\nWe do not know what all the individual pay recommendations from the review bodies will be, but Verify has done some calculations that give a rough sense of the potential impact.\nOverall UK public sector pay in 2023-24 was \u00a3272bn, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThe previous Conservative government had budgeted for a 2% cash increase in public sector pay in 2024-25.\nAnd last July, Labour said the cost of meeting the full 2024-25 pay recommendations would be an additional \u00a39.4bn.\nThat implies that total public sector pay in 2024-25 will have been roughly \u00a3287bn, which is around a fifth of total government spending.\nSo, if the total bill across the public sector for 2025-26 went up by another 3% - rather than 2.8% - that would imply the government needing to find about an extra \u00a3550m.\nBut if it went up by 4% it would imply the need to find around an extra \u00a33.5bn.\nThe government said in the 2024 Autumn Budget that it would seek to fund any pay rises above what departments have budgeted for not by raising taxes or more borrowing but by \"productivity improvements\".\nIn other words, departments would have to accommodate the additional pay rise by making cuts elsewhere in their budgets.\nThe government has reiterated this, with the prime minister's spokesperson telling reporters in December 2024 that: \"For pay awards to go beyond inflation they will have to be met by productivity improvements.\"\nThe National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, has already said it would resist any further effective cuts to the overall education budget.\nAnd it is demanding any pay rise for teachers be fully funded with new money.\nThe NEU said in April 2025 that it would vote on taking strike action if the government stuck with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year.\nAnd when the government indicated in December 2024 that it could only afford a 2.8% pay rise in the health sector in England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing both said the figure was too low.\nThe government funded last year's above inflation pay increase for public sector workers by increasing employers' National Insurance contributions and Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in November that she did not want to increase taxes again this Parliament.\nAs for borrowing, she has left herself only \u00a39.9bn of \"headroom\", or leeway, against hitting her chosen fiscal rules in 2029-30 and taking on additional debt to pay for higher public sector pay would risk being on course to breach her rules.\nBut analysts also warn that it will be far from easy to pay for higher pay through increased public sector productivity.\n\"If the pay recommendations come in higher than what departments have planned for, that will create a budgeting challenge,\" says Ben Zaranko of the IFS. \n\"If no additional funding is forthcoming, it will force ruthless prioritisation and tough choices elsewhere.

        "summary": "Why might public sector workers go on strike again?6 hours agoShareSaveBen ChuBBC VerifyShareSaveGetty ImagesThe government ended a wave of public sector strikes last summer when it accepted, in full, the recommendations of independent public sector pay review bodies to increase the pay of teachers, nurses and others.But ministers might be facing another headache over pay and the possibility of a fresh threat of strikes from some unions.BBC Verify examines why this pressure over public sector pay and industrial action has re-emerged.What are the public sector pay review bodies recommending?In July 2024, the new Labour government accepted the recommendations of these bodies to increase public sector pay by between 4.75% and 6% for the 2024-25 financial year.There is a new round of recommendations from these bodies every year and they traditionally deliver in the summer.In September 2024, the government decided to speed up the process by asking for their recommendations by the spring for how much public sector pay should rise in each sector in the 2025-26 financial year.These have not been made public yet, but reports suggest the recommendations are for more than the health and education departments have budgeted for this financial year.In their own submissions to the pay review bodies, the health and education departments said they could only afford to increase their pay bills in England by 2.8%.The BBC has been told that the teachers' pay review body has recommended a 4% rise and the NHS body has recommended 3%.In the case of teachers, this would be above the latest 3.2% consumer price inflation forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility for 2025-26.Because education and health are devolved, the health and education departments set budgets for spending in England only. Calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) show that, despite the 5.5% average cash pay rise teachers received in 2024-25, the average pay of most teachers in that year - when adjusted for inflation - was still lower than than it was back in 2010.In the case of the most experienced teachers, pay was 9% lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms.Official government data also shows widening gaps between the recruitment figures for teachers in specific subjects and their recruitment targets.Just 17% of the target for secondary school physics teacher recruitment was achieved in 2023-24, down from 42% in 2019-20.Overall teacher recruitment was 62% of the target, down from 87% in 2019-20How much would it cost to meet these higher pay settlements?We do not know what all the individual pay recommendations from the review bodies will be, but Verify has done some calculations that give a rough sense of the potential impact.Overall UK public sector pay in 2023-24 was \u00a3272bn, according to the Office for National Statistics.The previous Conservative government had budgeted for a 2% cash increase in public sector pay in 2024-25.And last July, Labour said the cost of meeting the full 2024-25 pay recommendations would be an additional \u00a39.4bn.That implies that total public sector pay in 2024-25 will have been roughly \u00a3287bn, which is around a fifth of total government spending.So, if the total bill across the public sector for 2025-26 went up by another 3% - rather than 2.8% - that would imply the government needing to find about an extra \u00a3550m.But if it went up by 4% it would imply the need to find around an extra \u00a33.5bn.Where would the money come from?The government said in the 2024 Autumn Budget that it would seek to fund any pay rises above what departments have budgeted for not by raising taxes or more borrowing but by \"productivity improvements\".In other words, departments would have to accommodate the additional pay rise by making cuts elsewhere in their budgets.The government has reiterated this, with the prime minister's spokesperson telling reporters in December 2024 that: \"For pay awards to go beyond inflation they will have to be met by productivity improvements. \"What have the unions said?The National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, has already said it would resist any further effective cuts to the overall education budget.And it is demanding any pay rise for teachers be fully funded with new money.The NEU said in April 2025 that it would vote on taking strike action if the government stuck with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year.And when the government indicated in December 2024 that it could only afford a 2.8% pay rise in the health sector in England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing both said the figure was too low.Why does the government not fully fund the recommended pay rise?The government funded last year's above inflation pay increase for public sector workers by increasing employers' National Insurance contributions and Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in November that she did not want to increase taxes again this Parliament.As for borrowing, she has left herself only \u00a39.9bn of \"headroom\", or leeway, against hitting her chosen fiscal rules in 2029-30 and taking on additional debt to pay for higher public sector pay would risk being on course to breach her rules.But analysts also warn that it will be far from easy to pay for higher pay through increased public sector productivity. Public sector pay is set through a separate process in Scotland.No extra cash for higher pay deals, says Downing StreetWhy would the teachers' pay review body recommend 4%?The recommendation of an above-inflation pay rise for teachers is likely to be because of ongoing concerns about staff recruitment and retention in schools.These have been raised in previous pay recommendations. The teachers' pay review body makes recommendations for England only but the NHS pay review body covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

He had a chance to end only two frames behind, but another miss in frame eight helped O'Sullivan inch a step closer to the winning target in the best-of-25-frame match.\nO'Sullivan, Higgins and Williams all joined the professional tour in 1992, and 33 years later they remain formidable competitors on the biggest stages.

We spoke to some of South Yorkshire's favourite creators about how the website changed their lives.\nRuth Amos from Sheffield runs Kids Invent Stuff. The channel has 71,000 followers and has been going since 2015. \nPrimary school children send in their invention ideas and Ruth and her colleague Shawn bring them to life.\n\"There's lots of different ways that you can make money from YouTube, there's ads, sponsors, collaborators or you can have things like Patreon, where people support the work that you're doing. \n\"Quite often, it you're a content creator you do a lot of those different ways, not just one of those things,\" she says.\n\"When I was growing up you couldn't watch someone's channel about robot making or cookery and that's what's amazing about YouTube \u2013 all of our hobbies have found a home on there as well as some of those viral moments.\"\nThe channel has run collaborations with Channel 4 TV show Taskmaster and had a go at breaking Guinness World Records. \nAccording to Ofcom, more than 80% of three to 17-year-olds use the site. A survey by the Lego Group in 2019 suggested a third of young Britons and Americans wanted to be vloggers. \nHowever, there are more than 100 million channels on the site - some with only a handful of followers or video watches.\nWould Ruth recommend the career to the children who send her their invention ideas? \n\"I think it is a career anyone can do because if you're interested in creating content, and you're creative, it's actually something lots of people can have a go at,\" she says. \n\"If someone wants to be a YouTuber I would also think about your other skills, because some of the most popular channels are channels where people are filming themselves doing something else. So think about your skill.\"\nLee Hinchcliffe, from Barnsley, has been filming content for the platform since he was 15. \nHe began with gaming videos before trying skit videos and then challenge videos.\nHis channel took off when he started playing McDonald's Monopoly. He spent hundreds of pounds at the chain trying to win a \u00a310,000 prize ticket. \n\"I never won it, I lost a lot of money, but people saw that video,\" he says.\n\"I've always had the love of creating videos and entertaining all my life, so that's why I've gone at it since school.\n\"YouTube is my university and I got my degree there, because you can watch back everything I've done.\" \nOff the back of his channel, Lee became a TV presenter with CBBC, starring on screen alongside madcap puppet Hacker T Dog. \nHe said his YouTube experience had made the switch to television much easier. \n\"Instead of doing a screen test and auditions, it was like, 'we've seen your videos, here's your mic, here's your earpiece, off you pop',\" he says.\n\"It's an obsession and it's grown into a career I'm able to do every day. There's no switch off because it's hard to switch off from something you love so much, and it needs constant plate spinning.\"\nSteve Garbutt, 55, runs Yorkshire Car Restoration in Doncaster with his son Shane.\nThe pair have been creating YouTube videos for the past five years and their business has boomed.\nSteve says they had gone from a 1,000ft warehouse to 10,000ft - and from three or four cars to more than 40.\n\"You have to put many hours into YouTube, because you not only have to do the work, you've got to change camera and lighting, and you're doubling your work load. Then you've got to go home and edit all your footage,\" he says.\n\"I've always been a bit of a techy, I like my gadgets and things. My original training when I left school was in computers. And then at 21 I changed careers because I thought there was too many people doing it.\"\nThey began on the platform by offering free car restoration to famous YouTubers such as Mat Armstrong, who has 4.5m followers.\n\"You've got to be very clever, you've got to look where the opportunities are. Rather than money it gives you a lot of opportunities. \n\"Our first opportunities were to restore famous YouTubers' cars free of charge, in exchange we got them advertising for us and sending us people to watch.\"\nThey have also worked with The Stig from Top Gear, Mike Brewer from Wheeler Dealers and Jonny Smith from The Late Brake Show.\nOriginally they hoped the channel would make money but they soon found the support they received more rewarding.\n\"We get so many good comments it makes you want to make another video. Even if the financial reward isn't there, because unless you're someone like Mat Armstrong it's not as profitable as everybody thinks,\" Steve says.\n\"The amount of hours you put in doesn't warrant that kind of money, you should be paid more. But the reward is massive.\n\"I would encourage someone not to just do YouTube, to make sure they get a career and base their YouTube on something they love.\n\"Don't think your niche is going to explode and make you famous.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North",

In the UK, nearly 18,000.\nThe study says governments should update their dietary advice to urge people to cut back on these foods.\nBut the UK government's expert panel on nutrition recently said there wasn't any strong evidence of a link between the way food is processed and poor health.\nThere is no one definition that everyone agrees on, but the NOVA classification is often used. Examples include:\nWhat is ultra-processed food and what does it mean for my health?\nThe numbers in the study are based on modelling the impact of ultra-processed foods on people's health. \nProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics, Open University, said the study makes lots of mathematical assumptions which make him cautious about what the findings mean.\n\"It's still far from clear whether consumption of just any UPF at all is bad for health, or what aspect of UPFs might be involved.\n\"This all means that it's impossible for any one study to be sure whether differences in mortality between people who consume different UPF amounts are actually caused by differences in their UPF consumption.  \n\"You still can't be sure from any study of this kind exactly what's causing what.\"\nDr Nerys Astbury, an expert in diet and obesity at the University of Oxford, also agrees there are limitations to the research.\nIt's been known for some time that diets high in energy, fat and sugar can increase the risk of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart conditions and some cancers, which can lead to premature death.\n\"Many UPF tend to be high in these nutrients,\" she says, adding that studies to date haven't been able to prove that the effects of UPFs are due to anything more than \"diets high in foods which are energy dense and contain large amounts of fat and sugar\".\nThis type of research cannot prove that consumption of ultra-processed foods is harmful, says Dr Stephen Burgess at Cambridge University.\nHow physically fit someone is may be the main cause of poor health instead. But when numerous studies across many countries and culture suggest UPFs could be a risk to health, Dr Burgess says \"ultra-processed foods may be more than a bystander\".\nThe Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said the term 'ultra-processed food' \"demonises a wide variety of food that can help people achieve a healthy balanced diet, such as yoghurt, pasta sauces or bread\". \nIt said all additives used by food manufacturers are approved by the Food Standards Agency, who ensure they are safe to eat and drink.\n",

        "article_text": "In the 20 years since its creation, YouTube has grown from humble beginnings to billions of videos being watched every day - but can posting videos on the platform offer a viable career? We spoke to some of South Yorkshire's favourite creators about how the website changed their lives.\nRuth Amos from Sheffield runs Kids Invent Stuff. The channel has 71,000 followers and has been going since 2015. \nPrimary school children send in their invention ideas and Ruth and her colleague Shawn bring them to life.\n\"There's lots of different ways that you can make money from YouTube, there's ads, sponsors, collaborators or you can have things like Patreon, where people support the work that you're doing. \n\"Quite often, it you're a content creator you do a lot of those different ways, not just one of those things,\" she says.\n\"When I was growing up you couldn't watch someone's channel about robot making or cookery and that's what's amazing about YouTube \u2013 all of our hobbies have found a home on there as well as some of those viral moments.\"\nThe channel has run collaborations with Channel 4 TV show Taskmaster and had a go at breaking Guinness World Records. \nAccording to Ofcom, more than 80% of three to 17-year-olds use the site. A survey by the Lego Group in 2019 suggested a third of young Britons and Americans wanted to be vloggers. \nHowever, there are more than 100 million channels on the site - some with only a handful of followers or video watches.\nWould Ruth recommend the career to the children who send her their invention ideas? \n\"I think it is a career anyone can do because if you're interested in creating content, and you're creative, it's actually something lots of people can have a go at,\" she says. \n\"If someone wants to be a YouTuber I would also think about your other skills, because some of the most popular channels are channels where people are filming themselves doing something else. So think about your skill.\"\nLee Hinchcliffe, from Barnsley, has been filming content for the platform since he was 15. \nHe began with gaming videos before trying skit videos and then challenge videos.\nHis channel took off when he started playing McDonald's Monopoly. He spent hundreds of pounds at the chain trying to win a \u00a310,000 prize ticket. \n\"I never won it, I lost a lot of money, but people saw that video,\" he says.\n\"I've always had the love of creating videos and entertaining all my life, so that's why I've gone at it since school.\n\"YouTube is my university and I got my degree there, because you can watch back everything I've done.\" \nOff the back of his channel, Lee became a TV presenter with CBBC, starring on screen alongside madcap puppet Hacker T Dog. \nHe said his YouTube experience had made the switch to television much easier. \n\"Instead of doing a screen test and auditions, it was like, 'we've seen your videos, here's your mic, here's your earpiece, off you pop',\" he says.\n\"It's an obsession and it's grown into a career I'm able to do every day. There's no switch off because it's hard to switch off from something you love so much, and it needs constant plate spinning.\"\nSteve Garbutt, 55, runs Yorkshire Car Restoration in Doncaster with his son Shane.\nThe pair have been creating YouTube videos for the past five years and their business has boomed.\nSteve says they had gone from a 1,000ft warehouse to 10,000ft - and from three or four cars to more than 40.\n\"You have to put many hours into YouTube, because you not only have to do the work, you've got to change camera and lighting, and you're doubling your work load. Then you've got to go home and edit all your footage,\" he says.\n\"I've always been a bit of a techy, I like my gadgets and things. My original training when I left school was in computers. And then at 21 I changed careers because I thought there was too many people doing it.\"\nThey began on the platform by offering free car restoration to famous YouTubers such as Mat Armstrong, who has 4.5m followers.\n\"You've got to be very clever, you've got to look where the opportunities are. Rather than money it gives you a lot of opportunities. \n\"Our first opportunities were to restore famous YouTubers' cars free of charge, in exchange we got them advertising for us and sending us people to watch.\"\nThey have also worked with The Stig from Top Gear, Mike Brewer from Wheeler Dealers and Jonny Smith from The Late Brake Show.\nOriginally they hoped the channel would make money but they soon found the support they received more rewarding.\n\"We get so many good comments it makes you want to make another video. Even if the financial reward isn't there, because unless you're someone like Mat Armstrong it's not as profitable as everybody thinks,\" Steve says.\n\"The amount of hours you put in doesn't warrant that kind of money, you should be paid more. But the reward is massive.\n\"I would encourage someone not to just do YouTube, to make sure they get a career and base their YouTube on something they love.\n\"Don't think your niche is going to explode and make you famous.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North",

        "article_text": "A child has damaged a painting worth millions of pounds by the American artist Mark Rothko at a museum in Rotterdam.\nA spokesperson for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen said it was considering the \"next steps\" for the treatment of Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8.\nThe damage occurred during an \"unguarded moment\", a museum spokesperson told the Dutch media outlet Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last week.\nA spokesperson for the museum told the BBC the damage was \"superficial\", adding: \"Small scratches are visible in the unvarnished paint layer in the lower part of the painting\".\nThe abstract painting is estimated to be worth up to \u20ac50m (\u00a342.5m), according to newspaper AD. \n\"Conservation expertise has been sought in the Netherlands and abroad. We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC. \n\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.\nSophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".\nThis is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.\n\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.\nThe Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.\nJonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"\n\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said. \nRestoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.\nHe said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.\nConservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.\n\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.\nRothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.\nUmaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.\nDuring his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.\nRachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".\nThis includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.\nShe said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum. \nThe loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.\nThe museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.\nThe Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.\nIn 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.\nSharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"\nThe Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.\nRothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.\nIn November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.\nIn another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it \"most likely\" disposed of 46 artworks by accident \u2013 including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen \u2013 during renovation works last year.\nMuseums have different policies when responding to damage caused by children.\nIn August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.\nAt the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".\nThe family were invited back to the exhibition with his family for an organised tour shortly after the incident occurred.",

        "article_text": "On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she \"basically knows nothing\" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.\n\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.\nStuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.\nToday's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.\nIts authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China. \nBut that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.\nVietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.\nBut it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.\nVietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).\n\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.\nIt's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.\nYou would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon. \nAnd when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.\nAmerica's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over. \nThe victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.\nBut few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".\nLinh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.\n\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.\nHer answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.\nA little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"\nWhen we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.\n\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"\nVietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.\nThe country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.\nThe ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.\nAfter the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.\n\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.\n\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"\nIt's no coincidence this shift began around 2018, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.\nTwo young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"\nThey plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.\nStill, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"\nVietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.\nLess than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.\nAs Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.\nBut even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.\n\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"\nBut he says he bears no anger anymore.\n\"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\"",

        "article_text": "The UK government has condemned alleged comments made by rap group Kneecap as \"completely unacceptable\" and suggested they should not be able to receive government funding. \nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch blocked a government grant to the bilingual Belfast group while she was business secretary, but the decision was overturned.\nVideo footage has emerged of the group at a concert in November 2023, where one of the band members appears to say: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP\".\nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he did not think \"individuals expressing those views should be receiving government funding\".\nKneecap have said on social media that they have \"faced a co-ordinated smear campaign\".\nThe footage is being assessed by counter-terrorism police and Badenoch has called for prosecution.\nThe Metropolitan Police said they are assessing that and another video, from November last year, where the footage appeared to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\" at a performance in London.\nThe Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Mich\u00e1el Martin called on the trio to \"urgently clarify\" the comments.\nBoth Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\nNone of the members of Kneecap has been charged with any offences.\nIn Dublin on Monday the taoiseach said: \"Have they, or do they, support Hamas and Hezbollah, because that would be unacceptable.\n\"I mean Hezbollah are responsible, in my view, for the murder of Sean Rooney. \n\"And both Hamas and Hezbollah have views that are absolutely... not just views, but participated in terrorist activities and appalling killing of innocent people, as witnessed on October the 7th. \n\"But it's not clear to me that they do, that Kneecap does support Hezbollah and Hamas. It's been asserted that they have made commentary in support of both.

        "article_text": "Vaibhav Suryavanshi has the highest strike-rate of all batters in this year's IPL\nWhy hit a single when you can hit the ball for a six?\nThat was the very question posed by 14-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi to one of his first coaches in professional cricket.\n\"Vaibhav was hitting sixes and fours off almost every ball,\" recalls Manish Ojha, a former first-class cricketer for Jharkhand.\n\"After the session, I said: 'Vaibhav, why are you only hitting boundaries? The state matches are a four-day format and we will need you to take more singles.' He replied: 'Sir, if I can hit a ball for six, why would I take a single off it?' That's when I realised he was ready for the next level.\"\nThat six-hitting lit up the most glamourous of cricketing stages on Monday when the teenager became the youngest player to score a century in men's T20 cricket.\nBatting for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans, he took down some of the world's best bowlers in a scintillating 38-ball innings that included 11 sixes and seven fours.\nExperienced international bowlers Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar and Rashid Khan were treated with the same disdain as those unlucky 12-year-olds who netted with Suryavanshi a couple of years earlier.\n14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stuns the IPL\n'Remember the name' - cricket world reacts to Suryavanshi century\nVaibhav's entry to the IPL has been dramatic. He started his career with a six off the first ball he faced and went on to score a hundred in just his third appearance.\nBorn in Samastipur, a small district in India's Bihar, he quickly showed promise. Vaibhav's father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, himself a club-level cricketer, saw a spark in his son. But there were no proper academies around the district, so he started his training at home from the age of five.\nSanjeev, who used to run a small shop, began to realise his son needed a proper coach. So when Vaibhav turned eight, his father decided to take him to Patna city, a three-hour journey away.\n\"Many people would tell him: 'What are you doing?' But he was the first person to believe in Vaibhav's abilities,\" said Robin Singh, a coach from Bihar.\n\"To ensure his son trained well and got to use the best facilities, his father had to sell a plot of land. His mother had to make a lot of sacrifices too. She would wake up at three in the morning to prepare breakfast for him and would even send food for the coaches.\"\nVaibhav impressed his new coaches in no time.\n\"When I started working with him, I found him quite different from others. You would give him a demo of a technique or a shot, and he would pick it up in no time,\" Ojha said.\n\"Most of the players adopt things easily in practice, but when it comes to playing matches, they fail. But the unique feature about Vaibhav was that he would execute things perfectly even during high-pressure matches.\"\nVaibhav was always ahead of his age group. From his strokeplay to game awareness, he would stand out.\n\"Within 10 days of playing alongside the kids of his age, we realised we were wasting his time. So, we started making him practise with senior players,\" Singh recalled.\nVaibhav would practise daily from 7.30am to 4pm, facing 450 balls each day. By the time he was 12, his coaches were confident enough to let him pursue cricket professionally.\nHe played for the Bihar under-19s team and amassed consistent runs, prompting selectors to name him in the India Under-19s team. Aged just 13, he smashed a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia.\nHe was soon drafted into Bihar's squad for the Ranji Trophy (India's premier first-class tournament) before becoming the youngest player to get a contract at the IPL auction as Rajasthan signed him for \u00a3103,789 (1.1 crore rupees) in December 2024.\n\"Vaibhav's role model is Brian Lara, so his game is aggressive, and he plays the ball on merit without any fear at all,\" Ojha added.\n\"We expected him to get an IPL contract, and our joy doubled the moment Rajasthan Royals got him because they have [India legend] Rahul Dravid on their coaching staff.\"\nSingh added: \"When he became the youngest to debut in first-class cricket, I told him: 'Anyone can become the youngest. I'll be happy when you become the youngest centurion.' So yesterday he called me up after scoring the century and said: 'Sir, youngest centurion.' And I couldn't be prouder.\"\nAlmost half of the runs Suryavanshi has scored in the IPL (46%) have come through the mid-wicket and long-on region. He is particularly savage against pace bowling, scoring more than 100 runs at a strike-rate of 243 in this season's IPL against the quicker men\nSuryavanshi has already been nicknamed Boss Baby in cricketing circles by those who see comparisons with Chris Gayle, aka The Universe Boss.\nWest Indian Gayle still holds the record for the fastest IPL century, having taken just 30 balls in 2013, but nobody else has scored one quicker in the competition, while he easily beat the record of 18 years and 118 days for the fastest T20 century which was previously held by Maharashtra's Vijay Zol.\nSachin Tendulkar - the greatest run-scorer of all time - made his India debut aged just 16, and Suryavanshi's former coach believe he will soon follow The Little Master into the national team.\n\"A guy from a small village in Bihar has made it to the IPL. The whole world is talking about him. So, he knows how to open doors. Don't be surprised if he makes it to international level soon,\" Singh said.\nBefore then, Suryavanshi, who has been gifted almost \u00a39,000 by his state government following his IPL century, has his sights set on title-chasing Mumbai Indians on Thursday, where he comes face-to-face with Jasprit Bumrah, the world's best bowler.\nListen to live commentary on Rajasthan Royals v Mumbai Indians on Thursday, live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app\nSuryavanshi's century has made the front pages of the newspapers in India \n1 of 3\nIPL auction: Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Rishabh Pant make history\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",
