        "article_text": "Donald Trump announced a massive tariff plan last week that would have upended the global economic order as well as long-established trading relationships with America's allies. \nBut that plan - or at least a significant part of it - is on ice after the president suspended higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days while leaning into a trade war with China.\nSo with this partial reversal, is Trump any closer to realising his goals on trade? Here's a quick look at five of his key ambitions and where they now stand.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike\nTrump's original trade plan packed a big punch that landed around the world, with a flat 10% baseline tariff on everyone (including some uninhabited islands) and additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on the 60 counties that he said were the worst offenders.\nIt sent allies and adversaries scrambling, as they stared down the prospect of a debilitating blow to their economies.\nThe White House has been quick to boast about all the world leaders who have reached out to the president to make deals and offer trade concessions \u2013 \"more than 75\", according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nAlthough the administration hasn't released a list of all the countries that Trump said on Tuesday were \"kissing my ass\" and promising to do anything, the US has announced it is in negotiations with South Korea and Japan, among others.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: America's trading partners have 90 days to strike some sort of agreement with Trump, and the clock is ticking. But the fact that talks are happening indicates that the president has a good chance of getting something for his efforts.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country\u2026We will supercharge our domestic industrial base.\nTrump has said for decades that tariffs are an effective way of rebuilding America's manufacturing base by shielding it from unfair foreign competition. While some factories may be able to increase production in current facilities, more substantive efforts take time. And for business leaders to pull the trigger on \"reshoring\" their production lines and investing in new US factories, they will want to know that the rules of the game are relatively stable.\nThe president's on-again, off-again tariff moves over the past week are inherently unstable, however. For the moment, it's difficult to predict where the final tariff levels will land and which industries will receive the greatest protections. It could be car manufacturers and steel producers today, and high-tech electronics companies tomorrow.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: When tariffs are applied and removed seemingly at the president's whim, it's much more likely that companies \u2013 both in the US and abroad \u2013 will hunker down and wait for the dust to settle before making any big commitments.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: I have great respect for President Xi of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us.\nAfter Trump's tariff about-face on Wednesday, several White House officials \u2013 including Treasury Secretary Bessent - were quick to say that Trump's goal was to drop the hammer on the real villain, China.\n\"They are the biggest source of the US trade problems,\" Bessent told reporters, \"and indeed they are the problem for the rest of the world.\nIf Trump wanted a battle of wills with China, testing each side's tolerance for economic and political pain, he got one \u2013 even if the president and his aides have hinted that they are looking for an exit ramp.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said that he blamed past US leaders, not China, for the current trade dispute. The prior day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would be \"incredibly gracious\" if China reaches out to make a deal.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Even if this showdown is one Trump wants, picking a fight with the second-largest economy in the world, with military power to match, comes at enormous risk. And along the way America may have alienated the allies it needs most in such a confrontation.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly.\nDuring last year's presidential campaign, Trump regularly touted that his proposed tariffs would bring in vast sums in new revenue, which the US could then use to shrink its budget deficit, fund tax cuts and pay for new government programmes.\nA study last year by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff \u2013 which is what Trump has landed on for at least the next 90 days \u2013 would generate $2tn in new revenue over the next 10 years.\nTo put that in context, the tax cuts Congress recently included in its non-binding budget blueprint would cost approximately $5tn over the next 10 years, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Trump wanted more tariff revenue, and if he sticks with his baseline tariffs, plus the additional levies on certain imports and larger ones on China, he's going to get it \u2013 at least until Americans switch to more domestic production, when the tariff money gusher could turn to a trickle.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will be indeed the golden age of America.\nAnalysts and experts have offered a grab bag of other explanations about why Trump made such an aggressive move on trade last week. Was he trying to drive down interest rates, or devalue the US dollar or bring the world to the table for a new, global agreement on trade? The president himself hasn't spoken much about those kinds of elaborate schemes.\nOne thing he has talked about relentlessly, however, is his desire to lower costs for American consumers - and he has promised that his trade policy will help address this. While energy prices dipped in the week since Trump announced his tariff plan, that may have been a result of fears that the trade wars could trigger a global recession. \nThe consensus among economists is that new tariffs will drive up consumer prices, as tariffs are tacked on to the price of imports and, eventually, when there is less competition for US-made products. Last year, the Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff would increase costs for American households by an average of $1,253 in its first year. Economists also warn that lower-income Americans will be hardest hit. \nTHE TAKEAWAY: An increase in prices is an arrow moving in the wrong direction \u2013 and it represents an enormous potential liability for both Trump's political standing and his party's future electoral prospects.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "'Red and green should never be seen', apparently - but Bernhard Langer was delighted to pair his red polo shirt with the iconic Green Jacket in 1985\nWhen Tiger Woods romped to his first Masters title in 1997, he did so wearing a red top that quickly became established as his iconic Sunday colour.\nBut the American, who would go on to win five times at Augusta National, was not the first to make the fashion faux pas of pairing a red polo shirt with the Green Jacket.\nForty years ago this weekend, Bernhard Langer set the tone as he marched to the first of his two Masters victories - he even wore red trousers, too.\n\"I always tease Tiger,\" said the 67-year-old, who was close to tears as he talked about playing in his 41st and final Masters this week.\n\"See, I was the one wearing a red shirt first; you came later.\" \nLanger has previously joked that he \"looked like a Christmas tree\" when he donned the famous Green Jacket for the first time in 1985.\n\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\n'McIlroy's Masters memories must be turned into a positive'\nCabrera wins on eve of Masters return after time in prison\nHis final Masters was supposed to be last year but a snapped Achilles tendon - an injury suffered while playing pickleball - meant the German couldn't play. So he delayed saying farewell to a place that means so much to him.\n\"They're the two most important wins in my career,\" he said of his 1985 and 1993 victories at Augusta, which are his sole major triumphs.\n\"It's emotional. You can tell already my voice is breaking a bit just realising it's going to be my last competitive Masters.\"\nLanger has conceded for many years that he no longer has the game to compete at Augusta; three missed cuts in his past three Masters are testament to that.\n\"The course is just getting too long and I'm getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \n\"I'm hitting hybrids [into greens] where the other kids are hitting nine-irons, maybe even wedges. So I knew I wasn't going to be in contention anymore.\n\"A few years back I asked the chairman of the club, 'is there a time limit? Do we age out when we're 60?'. He said, 'no, you will know when it's time to quit, it's totally up to you'.\n\"It is time to quit.\"\nLyle, Langer, Woosnam, Olazabal, Ballesteros and Faldo were victorious at Augusta National in an extraordinary era of success for European golf\nLanger was runner-up at The Open twice and third on three occasions in a career that promised more major success.\nThat he was unable to add a major other than his two at Augusta only intensifies his link to this fabled corner of Georgia.\nIn 40 appearances, he has made the cut 27 times and finished inside the top 10 nine times.\n\"It's been an incredible journey, for a young man born in a village of 800 people [in Bavaria, southern Germany], where golf was nothing, to make it here,\" he said.\n\"To get an invitation to play the Masters when it was extremely difficult for European or international players to get one, and then to win the Masters on the third go was just a dream come true.\"\nHe was just the third non-American winner, following in the footsteps of South Africa's three-time champion Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who won twice. \nHis win cemented belief among Europeans that success could be achieved at Augusta.\nBallesteros paved the way with his victories in 1980 and 1983, before Langer won his first two years later. \nThen Scotland's Sandy Lyle, England's Nick Faldo (twice) Wales' Ian Woosnam, Langer again and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal collected six of seven titles from 1988.\nLanger's debut was in 1982, two years after Ballesteros had broken the glass ceiling. \nThe German's initial experience was hardly noteworthy. He shot 77 and 78 to miss the halfway cut by one stroke after three-putting 11 times in 36 holes on unfamiliar greens that were too slick for a naive 24-year-old.\n\"Coming here the first time, driving down Magnolia Lane, seeing this place for the first time was an eye-opener,\" he said. \n\"I had never seen a golf course manicured like this or a tournament run as efficiently as this has been.\"\nBy the time Langer won his second title in 1993, he was married with three children\nHe vowed to come back better prepared and when he returned two years later he made it through to the weekend - the first of an incredible run of 19 successive Masters that Langer would play all four rounds.\nHis victory 12 months later was secured with a classic back-nine Augusta charge. He birdied four out of six holes from the 12th as he overturned a three-shot deficit to Curtis Strange, who dropped shots on three of his final five holes.\nLanger bogeyed the 18th but still beat Strange, Ray Floyd and his playing partner Ballesteros by two shots.\nHe made a solid defence of his title in 1986 and briefly shared the lead in the final round before Jack Nicklaus produced a back nine for the ages to clinch his record-extending sixth Green Jacket and 18th major title.\nThat week was also memorable for witnessing the first time a world ranking was published, and it was Langer who had the honour of topping the inaugural list.\nHe was becoming something of an Augusta specialist and the love affair strengthened with two more top 10s before he claimed his second victory in 1993.\nLanger was challenged by unheralded American Dan Forsman in the final round. \nForsman was one shot behind the German when he teed off on the notoriously tricky par-three 12th. He dumped two balls in the water, walked off with a quadruple-bogey seven and was barely heard of again.\nIn contrast, Langer's name continued to pepper the leaderboards at Augusta, with top 10s in 1997, 2001 and 2004. \nHe finished joint eighth at the age of 56 in 2014 and held the record for the oldest player to make the cut - at the age of 63 in 2020 - until Fred Couples eclipsed that in 2023.\nThis is Langer's final Masters but not the end of competitive golf for the former Ryder Cup captain, who looks as fit as he did in his pomp.\nHe shows no signs of slowing down on the PGA Tour Champions - the US-based seniors tour - and has racked up at least one victory a year since joining the circuit in 2007 when he turned 50. \nHe has won 12 majors among 47 senior victories - both of which are records.\nThis week he is back among the game's youthful elite though, and will seek to end his Masters career with the same controlled elegance with which he has played throughout his career.\nHe will not contend for the title. That is clear. Instead, the question is whether his Masters career ends after round two on Friday, or if he defies his own expectations and makes the cut.\n\"After four decades it's going to be bittersweet,\" he said.\n\"When I'm inside the ropes, my mind switches to being a competitor, play golf and take care of the task in front of me. \n\"But I might get a bit emotional looking around, seeing my family, my kids, my grandkids, my brother and other friends that are going to be supporting me this week.\n\"I love the Masters more than any tournament in the world. I'm expecting it to be very difficult emotionally.\"",

It was an injury that required stitches and disrupted the start of his year.\n\"If I was trying to take out the competition, I would definitely do a demonstration, something along those lines, but yeah, hopefully avoid the injuries,\" Scheffler joked.\n\"Maybe they'll cut up my steak for me, I won't have to use a knife or anything like that.

Not that Scheffler seems too bothered by creating his own bit of history.\n\"I really don't focus a lot on that stuff,\" he said. \n\"I focus a lot on the preparation and getting ready to play.

However, most major markets made gains on Tuesday with some notable exceptions.\nThe key index in mainland China was broadly flat on Tuesday morning but there were more losses in Taiwan and Singapore. After being closed for national holidays, Thailand and Indonesia also saw stocks fall by more than 4% and 9% respectively. \nTrump's post on Monday also indicated that negotiations on countries' tariff rates would \"begin taking place immediately\".\nTrump met Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Monday in the White House.

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg.

        "article_text": "A photographer's iconic shot of polar bears in abandoned buildings on a Russian island shines a spotlight on wider changes in their behaviour.\nIn September 2021, Russian wildlife photographer Dmitry Kokh and his team were sailing around the wild and remote Chukotka Peninsula in Russia's extreme northeast. They were hoping to visit Wrangel Island, a well-known gathering place for polar bears, when the weather turned.\n\"We faced a heavy storm, with super-strong wind and waves, and we tried to find a place to shelter from the storm because the boat was small,\" Kokh recalls. They sheltered near the rocky shore of a small, uninhabited island called Kolyuchin, home to an abandoned Soviet-era weather station \u2013 and made an unexpected discovery.\n\"We saw some movement on the island, took out our binoculars, and saw polar bears roaming around there, many of them, maybe 15 or 20,\" Kokh says. \"We were super surprised because we never expected to meet polar bears so far to the south. At this time of the year, they should be on the sea ice already, and on Wrangel Island, normally.\"\u00a0\nThe weather station on Kolyuchin had been abandoned in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Stepping on the island to take pictures of the bears was too dangerous. Instead, Kokh used a drone, taking his time to get the bears used to it, then slowly flying it closer. As he was watching them, he noticed something else: there were bears inside some of the houses.\n\"I realised that it was a perfect setting for photography, because these houses are super photogenic, they are old and ruined, and animals looking out of these houses, is a perfect picture,\" he says. \"And the weather was terrible, [there was] wind and rain and fog, which is also very good for photography! So everything came together.\"\u00a0\nOne of the photos captures a bear in the entrance to the weather station, and another one looking out of the window. Titled\u00a0\"House of Bears\", it won Kokh the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, given out annually by the Natural History Museum in London. \"It's the best picture I've ever taken, and I think I won't be able to repeat it, ever,\" he says.\nTom Smith, a\u00a0professor\u00a0of wildlife sciences at Brigham Young University in Utah, has spent decades conducting field work among bears, including polar bears, and says it's not unusual to see polar bears in abandoned buildings. \"They're curious animals so we see them in structures often, or they will be climbing on top of cars or pipelines,\" he explains. There has, however, been a more worrying trend across the Arctic, he says: as the sea ice melts, polar bears are increasingly approaching or wandering into inhabited towns or villages, to feed on open rubbish dumps. \"They are fatefully drawn towards human settlements,\" says Smith, and this can result in conflict with humans.\nThe problem is two-fold, according to Smith. One is that isolated, northern communities often use open rubbish pits near the village. Securing garbage so it can't be accessed, for example in bear-proof bins and enclosed landfills, is expensive, he points out \u2013 and in the past, was not necessary. \"The overwhelming Western influence in the north has resulted in [throwaway] economies that never existed there,\" he says. \"Those cultures never had a throwaway society, so the notion of having to secure garbage \u2013 that's a new thing.\"\nSecondly, Smith notes that polar bears are spending more time on land due to the climate-change-driven loss of sea ice. They are also shifting their dens from the ice onto the land, to avoid the risk of denning on the increasingly unstable sea ice, research in northern Alaska shows. Without the sea ice, the bears can't hunt for their preferred, ideal diet of blubber-rich seals, and may resort to land-based food, be it prey or rubbish.\n\"So we have a prediction that more and more bears are coming onto the land, they are increasingly hungry and drawn to these pits,\" Smith says. The rubbish pits tend to be close to the villages. \"Because of that, we can expect more and more conflict with bears,\" he warns.\nHe emphasises that polar bear attacks on humans are very rare. According to one study, across more than a century, from 1870 to 2014, there were only 73 attacks by wild polar bears on humans, distributed among the five countries with polar bears: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States. Twenty of the attacks were deadly, and 63 caused injuries. (Because the attacks often involved more than one person, the total number of deaths and injuries is higher than the number of attacks.) Smith says that humans are not part of bears' natural diet \u2013 in contrast to big cats such as tigers and lions, who do see humans as potential food. \"That is a global myth, that [polar bears] are the only bear that stalks and kills humans,\" he says.\nNevertheless, there have been cases where polar bears have attacked people, with malnourished male bears most likely to pose a threat to humans. In some cases, starving polar bears who have become used to human-provided food\u00a0may then see humans as prey, research suggests. Smith says it's the increasing proximity to humans that's the problem, rather than the bears hunting humans as such: \"The [bears] are there for the garbage, and then they will spin off into the village and of course they're quite capable of ripping doors and windows off. So we've seen an uptick in these confrontations,\" he says.\u00a0\nA 2022 research paper warns that food from human sources \u2013 especially waste \u2013 is an emerging threat to polar bears. The supply of such human-provided food including from dumps is growing, according to the paper. As a consequence, some communities in the Arctic have seen startling incursions of dozens of polar bears. The study notes that when given the choice between sea ice, and rubbish dumps on land, polar bears still prefer the sea ice \u2013 suggesting that they are resorting to the dumps out of necessity.\u00a0\nFor example, in 2019, 60 polar bears gathered at a dump near the village of Ryrkaypiy in the Chukotka region of Russia, a few 100 metres from the village, according to the study. The bears also entered the village, causing alarm, and forcing the villagers to cancel public events and keep their children at home. However, once the sea ice formed and thickened, the polar bears left the land and returned to the sea.\u00a0\nIn Novaya Zemlya, a remote Russian archipelago, a similar invasion of 52 polar bears happened in 2019, according to the study. \"Although polar bears had visited the dump in previous years, this event was unprecedented,\" the researchers note, and was likely due to the loss of sea ice. In Arviat, an Inuit community in Nunavut, Canada, the number of polar bears using the local open dump has grown each year since record keeping began in the 1960s.\u00a0\nSpending more time on land could threaten the bears' long-term survival, Smith says, as the marine diet is more suited to them. In particular, the high fat content of their preferred prey, seals, is crucial for their health. Fat, in the form of seal blubber, makes up around 70% of polar bears' natural diet on the sea ice. It contains twice the energy per gramme as muscle. In fact, when catching a seal, the bears mostly eat the blubber and leave the meat behind. To capture seals, the bears need sea ice \u2013 they stalk the seals on the ice, or wait by breathing holes in the ice for seals to appear. Over the past 50 years, as the sea ice has shrunk, the number of polar bears has fallen, studies show.\u00a0\n\"They're using [the fat from the seal] for everything: growth, maintenance, reproduction, keeping their body warm,\" says Smith. \"They just need a seal and some water and they're fine. They're unusual animals,\" he adds. They can subsist on this high-fat, seal-based diet without suffering any nutritional deficits, he says: \"It's a metabolic marvel\".\nWhen they can't access seals and instead resort to less fatty prey on land, such as Arctic birds, bird eggs, or food from dumps, the bears' health and reproduction rates decline, and they risk starvation, studies suggest. Polar bears on land lose around one kilogramme of body mass a day, research shows.\u00a0\n\"Part of the problem we have with climate change is the scale of change is so rapid,\" says Smith. There's not enough time for the highly specialised polar bears, who evolved to thrive on a diet of marine mammals, to adapt to permanently being on land again, he warns: \"We're fearful this animal can't possibly adapt back to a land-based, herbivorous diet.\" If they had to be on land constantly, \"as a species, they would die\", he says.\u00a0\nSmith and other researchers are appealing to governments to provide funding to help secure rubbish dumps near coastal villages from bears. \"It's extremely expensive. They need help. It wouldn't be asking too much to secure the garbage and make it safer for people, and for bears,\" he says. Otherwise, people confronted with growing numbers of bears in their villages may kill them to stay safe, he warns: \"It is extremely unfortunate to see bears die from such a preventable cause [as unsecured garbage].\"\nIn the town of Churchill, Canada, closing an open dump, along with other measures, decreased damage and human injury. Smith and his colleagues are also studying a range of additional steps to help communities co-exist with polar bears, such as bear spray.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The huskies that revealed the rapid shrinking of Greenland's ice\n\u2022 Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\n\u2022 The deep ocean photographer that captured a 'living fossil'\nWhile the real-life human-bear conflict is playing out, humans around the world still love seeing polar bears in pictures, the reaction to Kokh's photos suggests. In a video call, he shows a wealth of artwork and even tattoos which people made as the photos went viral.\u00a0\n\"This was an absolutely crazy time, because I got so many emails and interview requests, and many people were talking to me about these images. And they were saying something like: 'this is a post-apocalyptic picture, this is how our planet will look like if we continue to do the same things with the planet and won't change our ways',\" he says.\nFor Kokh, the award-winning photos of the polar bears opened many doors, and he has been on other expeditions to take photos of many kinds of marine wildlife. But as he reflects on that storm-swept journey to Chukotka, he comes back to the relationship between people and polar bears. For a start, even in that incredibly remote, wild region, you come across human rubbish, he says: \"What you see in this area of Russian Arctic, it's abandoned barrels, fuel barrels. It's a commonly known problem because in the Soviet Union they brought thousands of fuel barrels and abandoned them, because it was expensive to bring them back. And they still lie there, and polar bears are roaming around them.\" In the photo series of the abandoned weather station, for example, there is a shot of the bears standing in a landscape of scattered barrels.\u00a0\nBut Kokh also points out that the images can be interpreted in different ways \u2013 as a warning about our impact on the planet, but also, as testimony to the power and resilience of nature.\u00a0\n\"When I was taking the picture, I was thinking about the striking contrast between the living animals, and these destroyed buildings,\" he says, and holds up a bottle, and a cup: \"You know, all the things we make \u2013 this bottle, this cup \u2013 all the things made by humans, will be destroyed one day and will cease to exist, if we don't continue to make them. If humanity will fail, nothing will remain of us. But life will still exist.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has announced sweeping changes to his import tax regime to allow time for trade talks.\nA 90-day pause will be applied to countries that were facing tariffs over the 10% baseline. China, however, will see an even larger hike with tariffs on its imports rising to 125%.\nPresident Trump had been justifying his tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\". \nHowever, several of his claims about global trade were unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\nBefore the 90-day pause, Trump claimed \"we're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\".\nHe made the claim on Tuesday, one day before the pause. Trump then repeated the figure in front of reporters following the latest changes, saying \"we're now making  $2bn a day\" - although he did not specifically link the number to tariffs.\nBut BBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 8 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $192m (\u00a3149m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based his claim on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs - after the initial announcement  - was 22%. \nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level. \nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April - when the global tariffs were initially announced. \nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day. \nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. \nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported. \nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. \nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nTrump also claimed Canada charges higher tariffs after the \"first two cartons of milk\". Al Mussell, from Agri-Food Economic Systems, told BBC Verify that tariff-quotas are typically measured in tonnes.\n\"I suppose the president was joking but in any event,  it's not a couple of cartons\", he said. \nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\". \n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said. \nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false. \nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false. \nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA.  \nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Video games are the biggest form of entertainment in the world, but sometimes they bleed into people's lives offline in surprising and disturbing ways.\nChristian Dines' hands were twitching. As though he were still gripping his video game controller, about to make a killer move. But the game was switched off and his hands were free. The US-based sustainability advisor had also noticed how, when he glanced at objects in his room, he felt an urge to absorb or \"collect\" them, like weapons or power-ups in his game.\nHe swallowed hard. \"I thought, 'what the hell is this?' It was something I'd never experienced before as a gamer,\" he says. After a week of playing the same game maybe two or three hours a day, Dines' virtual experience was spilling over, disturbingly, into reality.\u00a0\n\"It all only lasted a couple of days, but the effect was disorientating,\" he recalls. \"It's unnerving to be distracted in some way by a screen when you're no longer in front of it.\"\nDines had, it seems, experienced something called Game Transfer Phenomenon, a condition in which the physical world and video games bleed together. While this might not be very common, for gamers who experience it, the condition can be extremely unsettling. And potentially even dangerous.\nThe term Game Transfer Phenomenon, or GTP, was first coined by Angelica Ortiz de Gortari, a psychologist at the University of Bergen in Norway. She first proposed the concept a decade ago while working on her doctoral thesis under the supervision of Mark Griffiths, head of Nottingham Trent University's International Gaming Research Unit. Ortiz de Gortari was motivated by her own experience of GTP. One day, she was walking around her local supermarket and realised that she was imagining peering at products on the shelves through a rifle scope.\n\"I thought, 'Wow! This is interesting',\" she recalls. \"A phenomenon that changes your perception by encouraging you to see objects through the lens of the game you're playing,\" she says, adding that her response had felt involuntary, leaving her with serious questions about what it meant.\nBut what exactly is GTP? Ortiz de Gortari suggests that one could compare it to potentially more common experiences such as ear-worms, in which you spend days trying to get a catchy song out of your head. Or when images from a television show you binge-watched keep popping up in your mind's eye. With GTP, though, the intensity is arguably dialled up, says Ortiz de Gortari. Not least because gaming activates brain areas associated with control inhibition \u2013 the ability, or not, to control one's thoughts and behaviour rather than acting on impulse. This can also occur while passively watching television, but to a lesser degree than while gaming.\nOrtiz de Gortari's studies suggest that GTP induces distress and dysfunction for around half of those gamers who say they have experienced it, with confusion, hyper-vigilance and irrationality among the symptoms. For others the only notable response may be a feeling of embarrassment that their game-play has spilled over into \"real life\".\nOne study participant she interviewed reported seeing health indicator bars like those in the role-playing game World of Warcraft floating above their companions' heads. Another spoke of lapses in concentration after not being able to stop \"seeing\" images from a game. Others said colours in the real world seemed transformed, and began to mimic the colours of a game world they had recently played in. While such effects are usually transitory, GTP can provoke a startling array of spontaneous or involuntary effects, according to Ortiz de Gortari's research.\nWhile rare, these effects can even take the form of involuntary physical actions and behaviours. A game could end up shaping the way one interacts with real world objects or people. For example, a walk down a supermarket aisle could be experienced through the lens of gameplay, with the player perhaps \"shooting\" at products or people, possibly with a corresponding involuntary physical action in the hands as though working console controls.\nIn total, Ortiz de Gortari has recorded GTP experiences among gamers related to more than 400 titles of all kinds. Her largest on the subject to date, published in 2024, involved the participation of 623 Chinese gamers, both male and female. The results suggest that between 82% and 96% of those gamers have experienced some form of GTP.\u00a0\nIt's possible that some gamers might have endured episodes of GTP but never admitted this to anyone, for fear of being considered \"crazy\", says Ortiz de Gortari. It is time we demystified GTP, she argues. \"The mission for me is to inform people about the phenomenon, to raise awareness, because the [gamers] I've spoken to about it have been very concerned,\" she says. \"Often, people don't want to talk about the experience of, say, seeing things that aren't there with their open eyes \u2013 even if that's what happens \u2013 because that's to talk about hallucinations, and they're associated with [potentially taboo, severe] mental illness.\"\nOrtiz de Gortari argues that GTP has become a more common experience as games, especially role-playing, simulation, adventure and first-person shooter games, have become increasingly realistic and immersive. They offer sprawling environments full of detail and interaction. Essentially, gamers end up living virtual lives through such media and can find the gameplay deeply affecting.\n\"The more realistic the video game world is, the more likely players are to confuse the game world and the real world,\" says Ortiz de Gortari, who adds that this could mean GTP is becoming more common and impactful. The sophistication of games has undoubtedly increased since the days of Tetris and Super Mario, she points out. \"Essentially the sophistication of the game facilitates the experience outside of the game.\"\nAli Farha, a gaming industry commentator and senior game producer at Stockholm-based Star Stable Entertainment, has experienced GTP himself. He describes his case as \"a pretty harmless sense of gameplay repeating offline\". He suggests that regular breaks during extended stretches of play and a period of conscious decompression after a long gaming session \u2013 reading a book or watching some light TV \u2013 could help counteract the likelihood of GTP raising its head.\nPlaying time \u2013 particularly above four hours \u2013 does appear to be a key factor in the onset of GTP. That's one reason why Scott Jennings, spokesperson for the US-based Gaming Addicts Anonymous (GAA), whose members invariably are at the high-end of playing hours, says the support group is increasingly mindful of this potential side-effect of gaming.\u00a0\nFarha also says that few people currently appreciate that, as he believes, the bridge between the real and the virtual is actually a two-way street.\u00a0\n\"We overlook that we also take the experiences and expectations of the real world into the game world \u2013 and that too can be disorientating,\" he says. \"I think it's quite common to enter a multi-player online game and feel loneliness, for example, even though you know you're at home. The experiences we have online become part of our personality. We build memories inside the virtual space of the games we play too, in the same way we build memories in the real world.\" In fact, studies suggest that games can be more conducive to memory formation than real life.\n\"I think for a lot of players the virtual and real worlds are starting to blur,\" Farha adds.\nWhile no-one has reported physical harm as a consequence of GTP to date reported to date \u2013 GTP could, in principle, endanger someone. \"It's not a good idea for me to be trying to kill demons while I'm driving,\" as Dines puts it.\nExactly why the virtual world can blur with the real world in this way, however, is still not clear. Some studies suggest different brain networks are activated when observing something in a virtual environment, compared to a real one. The same has been found with objects in augmented reality, where virtual elements are superimposed onto the real world. But some studies have shown that human memory can sometimes struggle to recall whether something occurred in a virtual environment or in real life \u2013 with the effects being more pronounced when using virtual reality systems.\nOrtiz de Gortari has indicated that GTP might be more common among gamers who have a tendency for mind-wandering and have a low working memory capacity. She also believes it could be the result of the game priming the brain or some sort of associated learning effect that when gamers encounter something similar to an environment or scene they came across in a game, it can trigger an involuntary response.\nBut these are all theories for now.\n\"The human brain isn't built to differentiate between reality and today's virtual worlds,\" says a spokesperson for Game Addicts Anonymous. \"That's one reason why games are so captivating and why it's no surprise the two experiences overlap.\"\nJennings also recounts a GTP-like experience. After playing an aggressive racing game he later felt \"a disconcerting urge\" when out driving, to smash into a vehicle that pulled up alongside him. He argues that GTP could be compared to alcoholism. It's not necessarily about how many drinks you've had but rather it's about your personal relationship to alcohol. Similarly, he says, while most people may have a functional relationship to gaming, some players are less able to contain its effect to playing time.\nRecent research by Ortiz de Gortari would appear to back this up. Her findings suggests that certain personality traits are likely a factor in one's propensity towards GTP. Other influences she cites include suffering from sleep deprivation, stress, depression or anxiety.\nMax Dzmitryiev, a US-based counsellor and gamer, says he grew up experiencing symptoms of anxiety. Video games, he says, offered an escape from reality.\u00a0\n\"But I'd easily get immersed in them,\" he recalls. \"And as the level of immersion grew, so the stimulation was higher and so I had more GTP experiences,\" he says. To him, GTP is \"freaky and unpleasant\" and something that can overwhelm his thoughts and decisions for as long as 20 minutes. After such a bout, GTP can keep popping up for days, intermittently, he explains.\nDzmitryiev has even noticed that watching someone else play a game can induce GTP-style effects. He gives the example of observing someone having fun in Minecraft, a colourful exploration and world-building game. Watching the other person's progress intently can lead to Dzmitryiev to, he says, literally perceiving his own surroundings as though they were built from the cube-like blocks used to construct the virtual environments in Minecraft. This effect \u2013 like an involuntary visual overlay to his surroundings \u2013 can last for an hour or so, he says. \"It's why I tend to stay away from VR games now \u2013 because I still feel fully immersed for too long after taking the headset off,\" he says.\nIt raises questions about whether the games industry should be addressing GTP in some way? Since so many games are played by children and young people, Ortiz de Ortiz de Gortari argues that developers should take more responsibility in addressing the potential impact of GTP on susceptible gamers, possibly through their own research, or at least by acknowledging its effects.\nDines says that he would endorse some kind of warning on games. It may only have relevance for a few gamers but that's no different to the warnings about strobe lighting effects, which could induce epileptic seizures in a small subset of players, for example.\n\"Game developers intentionally craft their products to give certain experiences \u2013 they know their game's power,\" says Farha. \"Players need to appreciate that games have to be used correctly. I know I've played too much at times and it didn't make me feel good.\"\nBut Nick Ballou, a postdocoral researcher in video games and mental health at the University of Oxford, expresses concern that overemphasising the dangers of GTP will fuel the moral panic around video games or stoke fears that all games are inherently unhealthy. Ballou is currently in the process of analysing data shared with him by the gaming industry. This data covers five leading video game platforms and his goal is to provide the most nuanced picture to date of how games affect people, both for better or worse. He aims to publish the first research from this project this spring.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why children love Minecraft so much\n\u2022 The mysterious origins of an uncrackable video game\n\u2022 The people who 'see' foreign languages\nMost gamers don't find that their hobby impacts their mental health negatively, he says. Rather, they more commonly report that gaming induces feelings of relief or relaxation, and that it gives them access to communities or offers a sense of achievement and identity. \"Any problems are at the extremes [of gaming],\" says Ballou. \"[Similarly], in small doses, GTP doesn't strike me as particularly problematic. If it was endemic we'd see more people out there behaving in very strange ways. But we don't.\"\nFor Ortiz de Gortari, however, there's a lot still to uncover about this extraordinary phenomenon. We still know relatively little about the way gamers unconsciously process what they see and hear during play. A better understanding of this, through a complex and expensive brain scan study, might, she says, help us unravel what happens as GTP kicks in.\u00a0\n\"We have enough evidence that GTP is happening,\" she says. \"Now we need to more about know how and why.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The more realistic the video game world is, the more likely players are to confuse the game world and the real world \u2013 Angelica Ortiz de GortariIt's possible that some gamers might have endured episodes of GTP but never admitted this to anyone, for fear of being considered \"crazy\", says Ortiz de Gortari.

He escapes jail, but must deal with his guilt when his co-worker takes the blame and is convicted.\nIt explores themes of shame, denial, grief and loyalty, focusing on Joe's complex relationships with those around him, including with his wife Kate (who will be played by Jean-Baptiste). \nThe production, directed by Ivo Van Hove, will play at the Wyndham's Theatre from 14 November to 7 February 2026.\nSpeaking from Los Angeles, where she lives, Jean-Baptiste said: \"All things that deal with the family and relationships remain relevant throughout time, they sort of transcend in that way, and to me it just felt like being able to delve into something that's quite personal.\n\"But also the way that Ivo does stuff kind of feels timeless, and I just felt that this was something that would be really interesting to explore.\"\nShe noted: \"Some of the language is of the time, but I'm interested in the challenge of making it very relevant now, and dealing with loss, denial, guilt are things the human beings do throughout time.\"\nThe play has been revived several times over the decades, and was last performed in London in 2019, with Sally Field and Bill Pullman appearing in a production at the Old Vic. \nAll My Sons will mark Van Hove's third Miller production, having directed A View From A Bridge and The Crucible, which both played in London and on Broadway. \nVan Hove described All My Sons as \"a devastating exploration of guilt, responsibility, and the far-reaching consequences of our choices, especially in times of war\".\nAsked about her ambition for the new production, Jean-Baptiste said: \"I hope it's just something that's fresh, leaves the audience thinking or feeling, that would be my only hope for the production, that it tells a new story, of an old story.\"\nIn a statement, Cranston added: \"Arthur Miller, Ivo Van Hove, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu... If there is something that I know beyond a shadow of doubt, is to surround yourself with the most talented people. \n\"This group of creative artists has got me so excited to be a part of the All My Sons company.\"\nCranston is best known for portraying Walter White in TV series Breaking Bad, and has also appeared in Your Honour and Malcolm in the Middle. \nHe was last on the London stage in a 2017 adaptation of the Oscar-winning movie Network, also directed by Van Hove, at the National Theatre. \nJean-Baptiste is known for appearing in TV crime drama Without A Trace and was nominated for a Bafta earlier this year for her performance in Hard Truths.\nThe film was directed by Mike Leigh, marking his second collaboration with Jean-Baptiste after the pair worked together on 1996's Oscar-nominated Secrets & Lies.\nJean-Baptiste said returning to the UK meant she was also looking forward to \"getting through a load of books, walking, people watching, seeing my family regularly, and friends that still live in London.\"\nBut, in contrast to the sunshine of Los Angeles, Jean-Baptiste joked she would need \"coats, scarves and hats\" given she will be performing in London over winter.",

        "article_text": "In his first few weeks back in the Oval Office, US President Donald Trump made several extraordinary decisions on foreign policy.\nHe threatened to annex Greenland, announced plans to \"take over\" Gaza, and started to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Paris climate agreement. He has also shuttered the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the government's main overseas aid agency.\nMany of these moves are not very popular with ordinary Americans, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Centre. It surveyed 3,605 US adults in late March - just before Trump imposed sweeping trade tariffs on countries around the world.\nHere are four takeaways from the Pew research.\nTrump has increased his rhetoric on \"getting\" Greenland, and Vice-President JD Vance recently took a controversial trip to the Arctic island.\nBut Pew found that most survey respondents (54%) did not think the US should take over the Danish territory. When asked if they think Trump would actually pursue the plan, 23% thought it was extremely likely, but a greater number (34%) said they believed he would not carry through with it.\nTrump also proposed an American takeover of the Gaza Strip, resettling two million Palestinians in neighbouring countries with no right of return. This would violate international law and has been described as \"tantamount to ethnic cleansing\" by the UN.\nOf those surveyed, 62% of Americans opposed such a move, compared to 15% who favoured it. Opinions were divided as to whether Trump was likely to actually pursue it. Again, the greater number (38%) thought it very or extremely unlikely.\nTrump signed executive orders to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Paris Agreement on climate change, and said USAID largely would be shut down.\nMore Americans disapprove than approve of such moves, the survey suggests - although the results are not a landslide.\nAt the start of his second presidency, Trump said he would \"work together, very closely\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine - a very different approach to that of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\nThe Pew research found 43% of respondents thought Trump favoured Russia too much - a higher number than the 31% who said he was striking the right balance between both sides. \nSince the survey was conducted, however, Trump's mood appears to have changed. He has said he is \"very angry\" with Putin over Ukraine negotiations.\nMeanwhile, Trump's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown increasingly close this year.\nAnswering a question about whether Trump was favouring Israelis or Palestinians, 31% of those surveyed thought he favoured Israelis too much. Close behind at 29% were those who thought Trump was striking the right balance. \nLarger than either of these, however, was the group of respondents who were not sure (37%). Just 3% felt he was favouring  Palestinians too much.\nWhile Pew Research Centre is non-partisan, those surveyed were not.\nThe results showed that most of the respondents (64%) who described themselves as Republican - or Republican-leaning - supported the move by the Republican president to end USAID, for example. \nThat compared to just 9% of opposing Democrats - or Democratic-leaning - respondents who felt the same way, indicating a high level of polarisation.\nGenerally, it is older adults who support Trump's foreign policy actions, more than younger adults, the research suggested.\nPew also asked about tariffs on China, although this research was carried out before the situation escalated sharply into the trade war that is now under way.\nGenerally, more Americans said the tariffs would be bad for them personally, but those who were Republican, or leant more towards that party, believed the tariffs would benefit the US.",

She said the doll celebrates \"LeBron as a role model,\" his ability as an icon to transcend culture and set a \"positive example for the next generation.\"\nThe doll features the Los Angeles Lakers basketball player in his pre-game fashion and reflects his height - it's an inch taller than the standard Ken doll. \nIn reality, the athlete is 6ft 9in tall.\nThe new doll comes as the company is facing financial uncertainty amid President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China, where just under 40% of Mattel's production is based.\nTrump announced on Wednesday that tariffs on goods from China would increase to 125%. He accused Beijing of a \"lack of respect\" after it retaliated and said it would impose tariffs of 84% on US imports.\nIn the same announcement, Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs and authorised a universal \"lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%\" as negotiations continued with roughly 60 countries. \nMattel has said it may have to increase prices and possibly implement changes to its supply chain. Consumer and business groups in the US have warned that the tariffs may disrupt supply chains and lead to higher prices.\nThe new Ken doll doesn't show the athlete in his basketball uniform. Instead, he's dressed in a varsity jacket adorned with \"LJ\" on the front. \nIt includes an Ohio patch and a crown patch on one sleeve and the number 23 - his basketball jersey number - on the other. On the back, \"LeBron\" is boldly printed along with the phrase, \"Just a kid from Akron\" - the Ohio city where he was born. \nUnder the jacket, the doll wears a shirt that reads \"We Are Family,\" a nod to the star's foundation. The doll includes accessories like a basketball, headphones and sneakers.\nIn a promotional video released by Mattel, Mr James reacted to see the doll for the first time. \"Oh, he dope!\" he says as he's given the figurine. \"That's so cool!\" \nAs he toyed with the doll's accessories, he joked the LeBron Ken doll \"might have to do a little lifting, legs are looking skinny\". \nThe move is a significant moment for the 65-year-old Barbie brand, which has made a push in recent years to diversify its dolls and reflect a broader range of careers, body types and backgrounds.\nThough Barbie has previously honoured athletes like Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and Megan Rapinoe, Mr James is the first male sports figure - and the first male figure not from the entertainment industry - to join the lineup.\nEven with four NBA titles, two Olympic gold medals, and a scoring record to his name, Mr James says his new title of \"Kenbassador\" hits differently\u2014because it's about more than basketball.\n\"It's an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness.\"",

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPSG come from behind in impressive win over Aston Villa\nThe fireworks that exploded all around the Parc des Princes were a fitting celebration of a Paris St-Germain display of devastating attacking power to outclass Aston Villa.\nThe pyrotechnics illuminated Paris in the same way Luis Enrique's thrilling side have lit up the Champions League, and they are now firm favourites to reach the last four after a fully deserved 3-1 win in this quarter-final first leg.\nAnd at the heart of it all were brilliant 19-year-old Desire Doue and Georgian genius Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who scored stunning goals either side of the break to turn the game around after Morgan Rogers had given Villa the lead against the run of play after 35 minutes.\nIt was testimony to Villa's fighting spirit, and the goalkeeping of Emiliano Martinez, that it took PSG until deep into injury time for Nuno Mendes to give Luis Enrique's side the advantage they deserved, a potentially decisive one before the second leg at Villa Park.\nPSG's Qatari owners have long made the Champions League their holy grail, and there is irony in that they now look the most equipped they have ever been to win it after finally moving away from the so-called 'Bling Bling' era of lavish free spending in favour of structured team building.\nBrazil golden boy Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and - to the greatest fanfare - Lionel Messi all arrived in Paris in search of the big prize, along with others such as Real Madrid's four-time Champions League winner Sergio Ramos. It brought only more disappointment as Europe's biggest trophy continued to evade PSG.\nThe return to common sense rather than chasing instant results has seen PSG acquire new jewels in their crown such as Doue and Kvaratskhelia. They are now an outstanding team, not simply a collection of superstar individuals.\nThe pair cost \u00a3102m (120m euro) but are talents for now and the future, unlike the \u00a3200m spent signing Neymar from Barcelona in 2017 and the mega-money given to Messi when he 34.\nIt even enabled Luis Enrique to keep the talented Bradley Barcola on the bench.\nDesire Doue translates to 'desire gifted' in English. He has vast reserves of both as Villa found out to their cost ,running them ragged on the flanks, equalising with a sensational curling finish high past a motionless Martinez from 20 yards on an angle.\nThere are rough edges to be smoothed out on the teenager, who drew the ire of France coach Didier Deschamps when he turned up late for his first day with the national squad at their Clairefontaine base before making his debut against Croatia.\nBut he is not short of confidence, stepping forward to score the winning penalty against Liverpool in the shootout at Anfield in the last round.\nDoue's idol is Neymar but he is making a name of his own following his \u00a343m (50m euro) arrival from Rennes last summer.\nWilliam takes eldest son George to watch Villa in Paris\nMendes' late strike puts PSG in control against Villa\n'We believe in Villa Park' - can Emery's men rescue tie?\nThis video can not be played\nDoue 'unleashes a brilliant finish' to bring PSG level\nPSG beat Bayern Munich to Doue's signature based on last season at Rennes. He scored four goals and had four assists in 31 Ligue 1 appearances with 17 starts last term, but also created 27 chances from open play.\nThis season he has reached another level, having created the most open play chances per 90 minutes of anyone in Europe's top five leagues - 2.6 based on having played a minimum of 750 minutes.\nThis term, among midfielders and forwards, only Ousmane Dembele (13.5) has averaged more progressive ball carries than his 12.4 per 90 minutes in Ligue 1.\nDoue has an impressive 22 goal involvements this season at a rate of one every 105.8 minutes, evenly split into 11 goals and 11 assists. Only Dembele (39) and Barcola (33) have contributed to more goals for PSG this season.\nHe has scored in each of his past four appearances for PSG in all competitions with five goals, and now has 13 goal involvements in his past 12 games, with eight goals and five assists.\nDoue is a free spirit in possession with a devastating turn of pace and glorious touch, and has a golden future.\nAlongside him, and a constant threat to Villa, was 24-year-old Kvaratskhelia, whose occasionally languid, jinking style cannot disguise the sort of natural gifts that saw him earn the nickname 'Kvaradona' when he came to prominence at Diego Maradona's former club Napoli. There, he tormented Liverpool when Jurgen Klopp's team were beaten 4-1 in Italy in the Champions League in 2021.\nHe troubled Matty Cash throughout the first half before the defender was substituted, but his replacement Axel Disasi was outmanoeuvred instantly by the Georgian, twisting and turning the defender before unleashing an unstoppable shot high past Martinez.\nAdd in Dembele, who is finally fulfilling all that was predicted for him when he was at Barcelona, and PSG currently have claim to be Europe's best team.\nThey thrashed Manchester City 4-2 here in the new league table format stage, then recovered from losing at home to a late Liverpool smash-and-grab before winning at Anfield and going through on penalties.\nNow, at last, there is real belief that PSG are finally ready to put their years of Champions League suffering behind them and win Europe's elite trophy.\nPSG are a joy to watch under Luis Enrique, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, and the vast bowl of Parc des Princes is a cauldron of noise and expectation.\nThere was even a nod to Birmingham-based TV series Peaky Blinders for Villa before kick-off, when a giant tifo emblazoned with a skull wearing a flat cap bearing the message \"By Order Of The PSG SG Fans\" was unfurled.\nPSG delivered in style, running Villa ragged as Unai Emery made an unhappy return to the club where he spent two seasons. Villa gave game chase, but ultimately PSG were too good.\nThey posted a passing accuracy of 94.5% in this match, their highest on record in a single Champions League game, the fifth highest overall and the second highest in a knockout stage game - all since 2003-04.\nPSG had 29 shots to Aston Villa's seven.

It is a sign of their potency that this was the fifth time since the start of last season they have had 20 or more shots than their opponents in a Champions League match, the joint-most of any side with Manchester City.And Dembele created nine chances against Villa, the most on record (since 2003-04) in a Champions League match for PSG, and the most by a player overall since Joshua Kimmich for Bayern Munich against PSG in April 2021, when he created 10.In the past 10 seasons, PSG have reach one final - losing to Bayern Munich in 2020 - two semi-finals, two quarter-finals and gone out five times in the last-16 stage of the Champions League.On this compelling evidence, they may at last be ready to take the final step.Related topicsEuropean FootballFootballMore on this storyDiscipline, injuries & family - how Dembele turned career aroundPublished19 FebruaryAn obsessive who lived through tragedy - can Luis Enrique deliver PSG dream?Published1 day agoListen to the latest Football Daily podcast There, he tormented Liverpool when Jurgen Klopp's team were beaten 4-1 in Italy in the Champions League in 2021.He troubled Matty Cash throughout the first half before the defender was substituted, but his replacement Axel Disasi was outmanoeuvred instantly by the Georgian, twisting and turning the defender before unleashing an unstoppable shot high past Martinez.Add in Dembele, who is finally fulfilling all that was predicted for him when he was at Barcelona, and PSG currently have claim to be Europe's best team.They thrashed Manchester City 4-2 here in the new league table format stage, then recovered from losing at home to a late Liverpool smash-and-grab before winning at Anfield and going through on penalties.Now, at last, there is real belief that PSG are finally ready to put their years of Champions League suffering behind them and win Europe's elite trophy.PSG are a joy to watch under Luis Enrique, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, and the vast bowl of Parc des Princes is a cauldron of noise and expectation.There was even a nod to Birmingham-based TV series Peaky Blinders for Villa before kick-off, when a giant tifo emblazoned with a skull wearing a flat cap bearing the message \"By Order Of The PSG SG Fans\" was unfurled.PSG delivered in style, running Villa ragged as Unai Emery made an unhappy return to the club where he spent two seasons. He has vast reserves of both as Villa found out to their cost ,running them ragged on the flanks, equalising with a sensational curling finish high past a motionless Martinez from 20 yards on an angle.There are rough edges to be smoothed out on the teenager, who drew the ire of France coach Didier Deschamps when he turned up late for his first day with the national squad at their Clairefontaine base before making his debut against Croatia.But he is not short of confidence, stepping forward to score the winning penalty against Liverpool in the shootout at Anfield in the last round.Doue's idol is Neymar but he is making a name of his own following his \u00a343m (50m euro) arrival from Rennes last summer.William takes eldest son George to watch Villa in ParisPublished2 hours agoMendes' late strike puts PSG in control against Villa'We believe in Villa Park' - can Emery's men rescue tie?Published13 hours agoThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Doue 'unleashes a brilliant finish' to bring PSG levelPSG beat Bayern Munich to Doue's signature based on last season at Rennes. Only Dembele (39) and Barcola (33) have contributed to more goals for PSG this season.He has scored in each of his past four appearances for PSG in all competitions with five goals, and now has 13 goal involvements in his past 12 games, with eight goals and five assists.Doue is a free spirit in possession with a devastating turn of pace and glorious touch, and has a golden future.Alongside him, and a constant threat to Villa, was 24-year-old Kvaratskhelia, whose occasionally languid, jinking style cannot disguise the sort of natural gifts that saw him earn the nickname 'Kvaradona' when he came to prominence at Diego Maradona's former club Napoli.",

        "article_text": "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.\nHVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.\nBut industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.\nAnd data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.\nEurope used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.\nIn response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".\nHVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.\nUK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.\nIts green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.\nBut industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.\nThat would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.\nThis palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.\nThey said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.\nAnother whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.\n\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.\n\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"\nAs well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce. \nThe figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.\nEU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.\nBut the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.\nThis mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.\n\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".\n\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.\n\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"\nUnderpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.\nIt is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.\nBut in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.\n\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.\n\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"\nThis concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.\nConstruction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.\n\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.\nThe European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.\nIn a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".\nIn the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.\nThe BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.\nIt would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.\nIn response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".\n\"The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,\" it said.\nSign up for our

        "article_text": "Constructed by a mysterious civilisation that left no written records, the massive site is now open to the public for the first time in more than a century.\nAutumn leaves crackled under our shoes as dozens of eager tourists and I followed a guide along a grassy mound. We stopped when we reached the opening of a turf-topped circle, which was formed by another wall of mounded earth. We were at The Octagon, part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, a large network of hand-constructed hills spread throughout central and southern Ohio that were built as many as 2,000 years ago. Indigenous people would come to The Octagon from hundreds of miles away, gathering regularly for shared rituals and worship.\u00a0\n\"There was a sweat lodge or some kind of purification place there,\" said our guide, Brad Lepper, senior archaeologist for the Ohio History Connection's World Heritage Program (OHC), as he pointed to the circle. I looked inside to see a perfectly manicured lawn \u2013 a putting green. A tall flag marked a hole at its centre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's because from 1910 through 2024, The Octagon had been used as a golf course. But on 1 January 2025, this ancient, enigmatic site reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a century.\nAll these prehistoric ceremonial earthworks in Ohio were created by what is now called the Hopewell Culture, a network of Native American societies that gathered from as far away as Montana and the Gulf of Mexico between roughly 100 BCE and 500 CE and were connected by a series of trade routes. Their earthworks in Ohio consist of shapes \u2013 like circles, squares and octagons \u2013 that were often connected to each other. Archaeologists are only now beginning to understand the sophistication of these engineering marvels.\nBuilt with astonishing mathematical precision, as well as a complex astronomical alignment, these are the largest geometrical earthworks in the world that were not built as fortifications or defensive structures. And while most people have never heard about the sites or its builders, that may be about to change.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nIn 2023, eight of Hopewell's earthworks were inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site. These include The Great Circle and The Octagon in Newark, Ohio, as well Ohio's first state park, Fort Ancient (not an actual fort). The other five are part of the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park: Mound City, Hopeton Earthworks, High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group and Seip Earthworks.\u00a0\nLepper told me The Octagon and The Great Circle were once a larger, single Hopewell complex spanning 4.5 square miles and connected by a series of roads lined by earthwork walls. Walking through both sites today, there is an immediate shock of scale. The Great Circle, where the museum for Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks is found, is 1,200ft in diameter. Its walls rise up to 14ft high and are outlined on the inside by a deep ditch. The Great Circle was once connected to a square and a burial ellipse, with only part of the square still visible today.\u00a0The Octagon sprawls a massive 50 acres and is attached to the 20-acre Observatory Circle, a large earthwork circle for gathering and rituals connected to the observation of the night sky.\n\"You could put four Roman Colosseums inside just The Octagon,\" Lepper told me. \"Stonehenge would fit within just that small circle now serving as a putting green.\" He added that 2,000 years ago, Indigenous workers built these earthworks without modern tools, digging up soil with pointed sticks and hauling it in wicker baskets on their backs. One estimate, he noted, is that they moved seven million cubic feet of dirt.\u00a0\nThe achievement of the Hopewell Culture, however, is not simply in creating large, precise shapes, which they did without the vantage point of hills for an aerial view. They also embedded a sort of hidden geometry within these structures. Until the mounds were measured and compared, it was thought that the builders didn't have any mathematical and geometrical sophistication, as there are no written records to testify to their level of knowledge. It was eventually discovered, however, that they made precise measurements across their earthworks and connected them in unsuspecting ways.\u00a0\nLepper explained that the circumference of The Great Circle \"is equal to the perimeter of the perfect square that it was connected to\", and that \"the area of that perfect square is equal to the area of the [Observatory Circle] that's connected to The Octagon\".\u00a0\nHe added: \"If you draw a square inside The Octagon by drawing a line from alternate corners of The Octagon, the sides of that square [1,054ft] are equal to the diameter of the circle that it's attached to [1,054ft].\"\nExamples of this interplay between earthworks have been found repeatedly by archaeologists. According to Lepper, that measure of 1054ft, whether halved or doubled, is found in other Indigenous earthworks across the country, and served as a common unit of measure.\u00a0\nWhile the Hopewell Culture's geometrical and mathematical knowledge astonished scholars, another level of sophistication appears when the layers are peeled back further: astronomical alignment.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The US's lost, ancient megacity\n\u2022 A mysterious US desert civilisation\n\u2022 A long-lost Maya city that was just discovered\nIn the 1980s, two professors at Earlham College in Indiana, Ray Hively (a physicist and astronomer) and Robert Horn (a philosopher), decided to pay a visit to The Octagon and its attached Observatory Circle. As astronomical monuments like Stonehenge had received great attention, they wondered if these earthworks were also aligned to a solar calendar.\u00a0\u00a0\nHively and Horn found no solar connections, but they then considered an alternative purpose: the lunar cycle.\n\"We thought deliberate lunar alignments unlikely at Newark,\" they wrote, because while the Sun can be tracked over a year, a complete lunar cycle takes 18.6 years. Even so, the lunar cycle proved to correspond to the position of the Observatory Mound at The Observatory Circle. There, one can watch the Moon rise over the exact centre of The Octagon in the distance every 18.6 years.\u00a0\n\"Astronomical alignments are only relevant and useful if they somehow tie the celestial orbs to belief systems and understandings of life,\" said Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University who has researched both Stonehenge and the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks. \"The ceremonies around the observation of the skyscape could well have a secondary function in terms of fostering community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThat ancient community and culture was part of the reason for its Unesco World Heritage Site inclusion.\u00a0\nA Unesco site needs to show that it has \"outstanding universal value\", said Jennifer Aultman, director of historic sites and museums at Ohio History Connection which helped lead its Unesco consideration. One criterion for this, she said, \"is that these are masterpieces of human creative genius\", which is where these mathematical, geometrical and astronomical features are important. The other, \"is that they bear really exceptional testimony to the cultural tradition that produced them\".\nAultman explained: \"You really can understand something about the lives of the people and what mattered to them by looking at, and learning about, the earthworks.\"\u00a0\nConsider the Moon, for example, which was clearly important for the Hopewell Culture. Darvill told me that, for some cultures, the \"Sun, Moon... are considered to have power over what happens on a day-to-day basis. As such, the heavenly bodies are often deified, which is how their power is justified and rationalised.\" It is therefore likely that the Moon was a deity shared by those who gathered at the mounds.\u00a0\n\"The land we know as Ohio is home to a number of extraordinary earthworks built by Indigenous residents of this region thousands of years ago,\" said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. While not all earthworks in Ohio are specifically Hopewell Mounds \u2013 such as the solar-aligned Serpent Mound Historical Site in Peebles, Ohio, for example \u2013 Wood sees them all as \"icons\" of Indigenous \"cultural achievements\".\u00a0\nSince the Hopewell Culture left no written records, only the earthworks and the few objects retrieved from them serve as their last cultural testimony. While archaeological excavations continue on some sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes and a small stone statue of a shaman wearing a bear skin and holding a human skull called \"the Shaman of Newark\" have been found. As these earthworks were gathering places and not villages, artefacts representing the locations from where these Indigenous peoples travelled have also been discovered, like effigy pipes, a copper head plate and an obsidian knife.\nHowever, after the Hopewell Culture gradually began to disappear starting around 500 CE, other Indigenous peoples stepped in to become caretakers of the land. One of those groups was the Shawnee Tribe, which called Ohio home before they were forcibly removed west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.\u00a0\n\"We may not have been responsible for building or creating them, but I know that my ancestors lived there, and that my ancestors protected them and respected them,\" said Chief Glenna Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, who believes that other tribes should have a role in the future of protecting the Hopewell Earthworks and communicating their cultural importance.\u00a0\nFor years, The Octagon was under the control of the Moundbuilders Country Club. After more than a decade of negotiations, the OHC and the club finally reached a deal in 2024 to transfer the site's long-term lease to the historical society, paving the way for them to open the earthworks to visitors beginning this January.\nFor advocates of the site's preservation, the Unesco designation and opening of these mysterious mounds to the public offers a new chapter to educate visitors about Ohio's Native American history. It also means more Indigenous stakeholders, like the Shawnee, can tell that story from an Indigenous perspective for future generations.\u00a0\n\"I just want people to know about it,\" said Chief Wallace, \"I want people to be able to see it. I want people to be able to visit it and want people to realise that it is a cultural phenomenon. That it's priceless.\"\u00a0\nThis story was originally published in December 2022 and has been updated to reflect recent developments.\n---\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The Great Gatsby is synonymous with parties, glitz and glamour \u2013 but this is just one of many misunderstandings about the book that began with its first publication a century ago, in April 1925.\nFew characters in literature or indeed life embody an era quite so tenaciously as Jay Gatsby does the Jazz Age. Almost a century after he was written into being, F Scott Fitzgerald's doomed romantic has become shorthand for decadent flappers, champagne fountains and never-ending parties. Cut loose by pop culture from the text into which he was born, his name adorns everything from condominiums to hair wax and a limited-edition cologne (it contains notes of vetiver, pink pepper and Sicilian lime). It's now possible to lounge on a Gatsby sofa, check in at the Gatsby hotel, even chow down on a Gatsby sandwich \u2013 essentially a supersize, souped-up chip butty.\nIncongruous though that last item sounds, naming anything after the man formerly known as James Gatz seems more than a touch problematic. After all, flamboyant host is just one part of his complicated identity. He's also a bootlegger, up to his neck in criminal enterprise, not to mention a delusional stalker whose showmanship comes to seem downright tacky. If he embodies the potential of the American Dream, then he also illustrates its limitations: here is a man, let's not forget, whose end is destined to be as pointless as it is violent.\nMisunderstanding has been a part of The Great Gatsby's story from the very start. Grumbling to his friend Edmund Wilson shortly after the novel was published in April 1925, Fitzgerald declared that \"of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about\". Fellow writers like Edith Wharton admired it plenty, but as the critic Maureen Corrigan relates in her book So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures, popular reviewers read it as crime fiction, and were decidedly underwhelmed by it at that. Fitzgerald's Latest A Dud, ran a headline in the New York World. The novel achieved only so-so sales, and by the time of the author's death in 1940, copies of a very modest second print run had long since been remaindered.\nGatsby's luck began to change when it was selected as a giveaway by the US military. With World War Two drawing to a close, almost 155,000 copies were distributed in a special Armed Services Edition, creating a new readership overnight. As the 1950s dawned, the flourishing of the American Dream quickened the novel's topicality, and by the 1960s, it was enshrined as a set text. It's since become such a potent force in pop culture that even those who've never read it feel as if they have, helped along, of course, by Hollywood. It was in 1977, just a few short years after Robert Redford starred in the title role of an adaptation scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, that\u00a0the word \"Gatsbyesque\" was first recorded.\nAlong with Baz Luhrmann's divisive 2013 film extravaganza, the book has spawned graphic novels, an immersive theatrical experience and a television film, broadcast in 2000, with Paul Rudd, Toby Stephens and Mira Sorvino. And since the novel's copyright expired in 2021, enabling anyone to adapt it without permission from its estate, the Gatsby industry has exploded. Early calls for a Muppets adaptation may have come to nothing (never say never), but a musical with songs by Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine opened (and closed) on Broadway last year; a separate, Tony-winning musical, The Great Gatsby, is still running on Broadway and is about to open in London; and author Min Jin Lee and cultural critic Wesley Morris both wrote fresh introductions to 2021 editions of the book.\nIf this all leaves Fitzgerald purists twiddling their pearls like worry beads, it's quite possible that while some such projects may further perpetuate the myth that throwing a Gatsby-themed party could be anything other than sublimely clueless, others may yield fresh insights into a text whose very familiarity often leads us to skate over its complexities. Take, for instance, Michael Farris Smith's new novel, Nick. The title refers, of course, to Nick Carraway, the narrator of Gatsby, who here gets his own fully formed backstory. It's the tale of a Midwesterner who goes off to Europe to fight in World War One and comes back changed, as much by a whirlwind love affair in Paris as by trench warfare. There's room for an impulsive sojourn in the New Orleans underworld before he heads off to Long Island's West Egg.\nLike many, Smith first encountered the novel in high school. \"I just completely didn\u2019t get it\", he tells the BBC, from his home in Oxford, Mississippi. \"They seemed like a lot of people complaining about things they really shouldn't be complaining about.\" It was only when he picked it up again while living abroad in his late 20s that he began to understand the novel's power. \"It was a very surreal reading experience for me. It seemed like something on almost every page was speaking to me in a way I had not expected,\" he recalls.\nReaching the scene in which Carraway suddenly remembers it's his 30th birthday, Smith was filled with questions about what kind of a person Gatsby's narrator really was. \"It seemed to me that there had been some real trauma that had made him so detached, even from his own self. The thought crossed my mind that it would be really interesting if someone were to write Nick's story,\" he says. In 2014, by then a published author in his 40s, he sat down to do just that, telling neither his agent nor his editor. It was only when he delivered the manuscript 10 months later that he learned copyright law meant he'd have to wait until 2021 to publish it.\nSmith points to a quote from one of Fitzgerald's contemporaries as having provided the key to understanding Carraway. \"Ernest Hemingway says in [his memoir] A Moveable Feast that we didn't trust anyone who wasn't in the war, and to me that felt like a natural beginning for Nick.\" Smith imagines Carraway, coping with PTSD and shellshock, returning home to a nation that he no longer recognises. It's a far cry from the riotous razzmatazz of all that partying, yet Carraway is, Smith suggests, the reason Fitzgerald's novel remains read. \"Maybe it's not the champagne and the dancing, maybe it is those feelings of wondering where we are, the sense that anything can crumble at any moment, that keep Gatsby meaningful from one generation to the next.\"\nMore like this:\nWilliam Cain, an expert in American literature and the Mary Jewett Gaiser Professor of English at Wellesley College, agrees that Nick is crucial to understanding the novel's richness. \"Fitzgerald gave some thought to structuring it in the third person but ultimately he chose Nick Carraway, a first-person narrator who would tell Gatsby's story, and who would be an intermediary between us and Gatsby. We have to respond to and understand Gatsby and, as we do so, remain aware that we're approaching him through Nick's very particular perspective, and through Nick's very ambivalent relationship to Gatsby, which is simultaneously full of praise and full of severe criticism, even at some moments contempt,\" he says.\nLike Smith, Cain first encountered the novel as a student. It was a different era \u2013 the 1960s \u2013 but even so, little attention was paid to Nick. Cain recalls instead talk of symbolism \u2013 the legendary green light, for example, and Gatsby's fabled automobile. It's a reminder that, in a way, the education system is as much to blame as pop culture for our limited readings of this seminal text. It may be a Great American Novel but, at fewer than 200 pages, its sublimely economical storytelling makes its study points very easy to access. Ironically, given that this is a novel of illusion and delusion, in which surfaces are crucial, we all too often overlook the texture of its prose. As Cain puts it, \"I think when we consider The Great Gatsby, we need to think about it not just as a novel that is an occasion or a point of departure for us to talk about big American themes and questions, but we have to really enter into the richness of Fitzgerald's actual page-to-page writing. We have to come to Gatsby, yes, aware of its social and cultural significance, but also we need to return to it as a literary experience.\"\nCain re-reads the novel every two or three years but frequently finds himself thinking about it in between \u2013 in 2020, for instance, when US President Biden, accepting the Democratic nomination at the DNC, spoke of the right to pursue dreams of a better future. The American Dream is, of course, another of Gatsby's Big Themes, and one that continues to be misunderstood. \"Fitzgerald shows that that dream is very powerful, but that it is indeed a very hard one for most Americans to realise. It feeds them great hopes, great desires, and it's extraordinary, the efforts that so many of them make to fulfil those dreams and those desires, but that dream is beyond the reach of many, and many, they give up all too much to try to achieve that great success,\" Cain points out. Among the obstacles, Fitzgerald seems to suggest, are hard-and-fast class lines that no amount of money will enable Gatsby to cross. It's a view that resonates with a mood that Cain says he's been picking up on among his students \u2013 a certain \"melancholy\" for the American Dream, the feeling fanned by racial and economic inequalities that the pandemic has only deepened.\nIn other certain respects, the novel hasn't worn quite so well. While Fitzgerald showed where his allegiances lay by highlighting the brute ugliness of Tom Buchanan's white supremacist beliefs, he repeatedly describes African Americans as \"bucks\". The novel makes for frustrating reading from a feminist perspective, too: its female characters lack dimensionality and agency, and are seen instead through the prism of male desire. But the path is now open to endless creative responses to those more dated and unpleasant aspects. Jane Crowther's newly published novel, Gatsby, updates the plot to the 21st Century, and flips the genders to feature a female Jay Gatsby and a male Danny Buchanan. And Claire Anderson-Wheeler's The Gatsby Gambit is a murder mystery which invents a younger sister for Fitzgerald's eponymous anti-hero: Greta Gatsby \u2013 get it?\nTo an impressive degree, however, the renewed attention brought by the copyright expiry and the centenary shows not just how relevant and seductive the text of Fitzgerald's novel remains, but how very alive it's always been. Pick it up at 27, and you'll find a different novel to the one you read as a teenager. Revisit it again at 45, and it'll feel like another book altogether. Copyright has never had any bearing on the impact of the words it governs.\nWhen Smith was finally able to publish Nick in 2021, he returned once more to The Great Gatsby before turning in his last edit. \"I think it will be a novel that's always evolving in my head, and always changing based on who I am,\" he says. \"That's what great novels do.\"\nA version of this article was originally published in 2021.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Home to three Michelin-starred restaurants and a royal gingerbread legacy, the unassuming Lancashire town of Ormskirk is fast becoming the UK's most delicious destination.\nWhen it comes to UK destinations for a gourmet weekend away, there's a new name on the lips of serious foodies. Forget the metropolitan streets of Chelsea, Mayfair or even Edinburgh. Britain's latest gastronomic hotspot is in the rural hinterlands of deepest Lancashire.\nHolidaymakers journeying to this historic county in north-west England \u2013 a key location in the English and Industrial revolutions \u2013 would have traditionally been heading for Blackpool, the classic British seaside resort whose best-known epicurean delight is Blackpool Rock, a tooth-shatteringly tough cylindrical stick of boiled sugar and glucose syrup.\u00a0\nBut, for those with more refined palates \u2013 or more delicate dental work \u2013 the tastiest rewards are to be found in Ormskirk, a bustling market town that was once a Viking settlement, and in Aughton, the small village next door.\u00a0\nIt's in this small village where Mark Birchall serves as chef patron of Moor Hall, a produce-driven restaurant within the grounds of a Grade II-listed, 16th-Century manor house. And at this year's Michelin awards, he was the only chef in Britain and Ireland to have been awarded a third Michelin star. As such, he has become one of only 10 chefs in the country (and fewer than 150 in the entire world) to hold the three-star accolade, a designation signalling that, according to the tyre company's inspectors, a restaurant is worth making a dedicated journey for.\nNo stranger to recognition, Moor Hall was voted Best Restaurant in England in the 2023 National Restaurant Awards, and also possesses a green Michelin star for the sustainable cooking practices used to create its 18-course tasting menu. Additionally, Birchall's \"neighbourhood restaurant\", The Barn (offering more casual dining at a lower price point), is a mere 30 second stroll around the lake from Moor Hall and possesses a Michelin star of its very own too.\nAs if that weren't enough, less than 10 minutes' walk away is Chef Tim Allen's restaurant s\u014d-l\u014d which has a Michelin star as well, bringing the total to a rather stellar six in the space of less than half a mile.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo what makes the food so special in this part of Lancashire, I ask Birchall as he forages for micro herbs and other ingredients on Moor Hall's six-acre country estate, dotted with secluded luxury garden rooms where diners can stay.\u00a0\n\"Aughton and Ormskirk have a deep-rooted connection to the land, and that plays a massive part in why the food here is so special,\" he tells me. \"The landscape, the soil, the weather \u2013 it all contributes to the quality of the produce. We're lucky to have incredibly fertile, well-draining soil, which means the fruit and vegetables \u2013 particularly leafy greens, brassicas and root veg \u2013 even the grass that feeds the livestock, are all packed with flavour.\"\nIndeed, the West Lancashire coastal plain between Preston and Southport is often referred to as \"the salad bowl of England\". According to the National Farmers Union, England's north-west region accounts for 15% of the country's food production, leading them to call it \"Britain's farming powerhouse\".\n\"The climate, too, plays its role,\" Birchall continues. \"We get just the right balance \u2013 enough rain to keep things abundant, but not so much that it drowns the land. That allows for a longer growing season, and when you combine that with generations of skilled farmers who understand how to work with the land, you get outstanding ingredients. It's that connection between produce and place that really sets the region apart.\"\nAllen agrees with Birchall, with whom he consulted before opening s\u014d-l\u014d. He has seen an influx of foodies not just from London (which is a little more than two hours away by train) but from right across the globe. \"We get people coming from America, Mexico, Norway, Finland, even Singapore,\" Allen tells me.\n\"But also, because we're located midway between Liverpool and Manchester \u2013 whose football teams (Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United) are massive \u2013 you get a lot of people travelling for the football. And many of them, it turns out, quite like eating Michelin-starred food.\"\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, these discerning fans eschew the plastic platefuls of pie and chips usually consumed on the terraces to partake of Allen's altogether more elevated offerings; dishes made with ingredients such as Louet Fessier oyster emulsion, Oscietra caviar and salt-baked celeriac (which he employs somebody to grow purely for s\u014d-l\u014d's seven-course tasting menu).\nBut this part of Lancashire offers more than the ultra-modern cordon bleu cuisine of Moor Hall and s\u014d-l\u014d; travellers in search of the area's deepest culinary roots may find them at the famous Omskirk Market. Held on Thursdays and Saturdays, it is one of the country's oldest (King Edward I granted it a Royal Charter in 1286) and is where you can sample the town's original claim to culinary fame: gingerbread.\nAs far back as 1732, recipes for the spicy baked treat were being passed down through generations of Ormskirkers. Sellers \u2013 almost exclusively women identified by their white shawls and aprons \u2013 would tout fresh gingerbread to passengers on the stagecoaches that stopped at the inns along Aughton Street on their way from Liverpool to Preston. When Ormskirk railway station opened in 1849, the women switched to targeting train passengers.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The English wine that's rivalling Champagne\n\u2022 Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022 The surprising 'lesbian capital of the UK'\n\"They would make their way along the platform, loudly knocking on all the carriage windows crying out 'Gingerbread! Who will buy my freshly baked gingerbread?',\" explains Kathryn MacDonald of the Ormskirk and District Family History Society. \"There were so many of them and they were such persuasive sellers that Ormskirk's gingerbread women became well known around the region. So when, in 1885, the Prince of Wales alighted here \u2013 he was going to a shooting party at nearby Lathom House \u2013 there was a welcome reception put on for him at the station and three of the gingerbread women were allowed to present the Prince with a gift of Ormskirk gingerbread. A few years later, when he became king (Edward VII), he'd stop the royal train at Ormskirk on his way up to Balmoral, and stock up with supplies for himself and the royal family. So, he obviously must have really liked our gingerbread!\"\nThe white-aproned women no longer ply their wares at the station, but one baker of Ormskirk gingerbread can still be found today in the town. Mr Thompson's Bakery is a family business run by Neil Thompson, his wife Janet and daughter Lilli who bake the treats in a converted shed in their back garden.\n\"Back in 2010, we revived an ancient Ormskirk gingerbread recipe but made some tweaks, such as using less salt, to suit modern tastes,\" says Lilli, who mans their stall each week at Ormskirk's famous food market.\nThe Thompsons' bakery, which has appeared in an episode of BBC TV's The Hairy Bikers Go West, is also carrying on the town's tradition of reeling in royalty with its legendary gingerbread. Janet reveals how she and Lilli were given the honour, when Princess Anne visited Ormskirk in 2022 to open a new facility at Edge Hill University, of including some of their gingerbread in a welcome hamper.\n\"Has she come back since to stock up with supplies, like her great-grandfather Edward VII did?\" I ask.\n\"Not as far I know,\" she laughs, \"but I'd like to think there's a secret stash of Ormskirk gingerbread somewhere in one of the larders of Buckingham Palace!\"\u00a0\nEach year the town hosts Ormskirk Gingerbread Festival which, this year, is scheduled to take place on 13 July. The family-friendly event allows locals and visitors to learn more about the town's culinary heritage, and some women dress up in white shawls and aprons to honour Ormskirk's most famous gingerbread hawkers.\nIt's also an opportunity to celebrate this unassuming pocket of Lancashire that has quietly become a food lover's destination in its own right \u2013 no small achievement in a country where most culinary trends tend to point south. Whether you come for the royal gingerbread, the six Michelin stars or the rich farming roots that nourish it all, Ormskirk delivers the goods\u2026 and they\u2019re anything but half-baked.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

And he ranks second in Ligue 1 for completed dribbles with 74, behind Paris St-Germain's Desire Doue with 79.\nThere are also training videos of Cherki with France Under-21s, where he displays equal ability to control and volley a ball with both feet. \n\"He is two-footed, has no fear, keeps going and going, can get past people with such ease, such finesse,\" says Maitland-Niles.\n\"He is now working for the team off the ball and has gone to another level this season.\"\nIn an in-depth interview with BBC Sport, Maitland-Niles also talks about why Arsenal are too reliant on Saka, success under Jose Mourinho at Roma, moving to France and why Lyon will show Manchester United \"respect\". \nMaitland-Niles has been a near ever-present for Lyon and played 34 matches in all competitions this season\nAfter becoming the second youngest Arsenal player to appear in the Champions League, Maitland-Niles thought he would be at his boyhood club his entire life. \nThe defender had been in the Arsenal academy since the age of six and grew up supporting the club but opted to leave on a free transfer to Lyon in 2023. \n\"Life has obviously taken a different turn,\" he says. \"I thought I'd have been in the Premier League my whole career and things obviously didn't go to plan with Arsenal.\n\"But I'm thankful to the club and they didn't put any blockages when it came to leaving. I left as, like most footballers, I wanted to play.\"\nBut why not join another Premier League club? \nHe says: \"I told my agent not to tell me which clubs were interested but just the ones with firm offers. \n\"Lyon were the first to come in and it was such a big club showing their trust and belief in me. It was hard to turn down and it was a good time to try something different. I was at a point where I needed to be shown a lot of love and thought it was a good fit for me. \n\"Of course, I am happy with where I am at this point in time. But who is to say what might come up? In the meantime, I am very happy here and enjoying every moment.\n\"I am still that same player as I was at Arsenal but now with a stronger mindset and more consistency and I know what it takes to succeed.\"\nMaitland-Niles won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2020\nA debut under legendary manager Arsene Wenger, a Europa League final start under Unai Emery in 2019, winning the FA Cup with Mikel Arteta in 2020 and winning five England caps all rank among the major landmarks in Maitland-Niles' journey.\n\"I'm still an Arsenal fan, I watch most of our games and I lived a boyhood dream by winning an FA Cup final at Wembley for the club. [That] was the pinnacle. I supported Arsenal since I was six. I wish them well,\" he adds. \nBut the FA Cup under Arteta, who he regards as a \"tactical genius in Pep Guardiola's mould\", is the last trophy Arsenal have won. \n\"[Arteta] really studied how Pep took football to new heights as one of the best managers in the world,\" he says. \"He really studied how to break down teams and be most effective in games.\n\"Arsenal are showing that at this point, not coming close enough to win the league but you can see they are making big improvements by going close two years in a row.\"\nOn his relationship with Arteta, the defender adds: \"I wouldn't say there was anything special there. I had respect for him as a manager, I thought he was a tactical genius but it was an average player-manager relationship, not especially close.\"\nMaitland-Niles also admits it is \"frustrating\" the club has not followed up that FA Cup success but gives his backing to Arteta, while adding star attacker Saka needs support.\n\"I think they now rely on him a bit too much and you can't expect so much from such a young player,\" he says.\n\"He hasn't even hit his prime yet. But I think he is the driving force of the team and they miss a bit of attacking threat when he is not playing.\n\"Bukayo has become one of the world's best wingers, very consistent, knows how to kill off a game and he can pick his moment in a genius way.\"\nAttacker Ethan Nwaneri, 18, is having his breakthrough this season and could be one option to help Saka.\n\"Physically, he is absolutely incredible and there is no fear in the kid,\" continues Maitland-Niles.  \n\"He is just going at people and trying to make things happen. You can see he is trying to become a leader very early in that team. He is trying to cement his place which is difficult as he plays in the same positions as [Martin] Odegaard and Saka. \n\"But he has got the ability to do so as well. He has the world at his feet and he just needs to take his chance.\"\nAnother landmark for Maitland-Niles was winning the Conference League under Mourinho during a successful six-month loan stint at Roma.\n\"He is a really funny guy,\" says Maitland-Niles. \"The stories Jose gave us about his previous dressing rooms and how he has won cup finals and loads of different leagues - that is an experience you can take something from.\n\"There are a lot of players that would say they love him or hate him. But he is a great guy and what you see is what you get.\"\nMaitland-Niles achieved European success in the Conference League for Jose Mourinho's Roma in 2022\nMaitland-Niles, who is becoming one of the leaders at Lyon, has warned Thursday's Europa League opponents Manchester United that \"people don't realise how big Lyon are\".\n\"We are a historically big club,\" he adds. \"Considering where we were last season, it has been a great year but we need to be addicted to winning, push for more and aim for the Champions League.\"\nMaitland-Niles also says Lyon will try to show Ruben Amorim's United side \"respect but just not too much respect\".\nHe adds: \"They are not having the greatest season but have players like Bruno (Fernandes) and (Christian) Eriksen can run over you if you show too much respect. \n\"We have a great team, great manager and team spirit. We will not be scared, we'll give it our all and believe we can win.\"\nOf course, returning to England for the second leg will also prove exciting.\nHe says: \"As an Englishman, it will be nice to go home. Old Trafford is nothing short of what they call it, the Theatre of Dreams - it can be a dream for you but it can crush your dreams, too.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Organised crime gangs are behind a sharp rise in scams linked to fraudulent QR codes, experts say.\nThe national fraud reporting centre Action Fraud received 1,386 reports of people being targeted last year, compared with 100 in 2019.\nContactless payment hotspots - like parking meters and restaurant menus - are common targets of criminals who stick their own QR codes on signage.\nKatherine Hart, lead officer at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: \"We've seen huge amounts lost this way. People have seen their life savings gone and that money is going to finance criminals.\"\nShe said quishing was significantly under-reported and presented a \"huge challenge\" to authorities globally.\n\nFraudulent and misleading codes have also been spotted on parcels, in emails and on television.\nPeople who scan them using mobile phones and other electronic devices are directed to websites controlled by the scammers and tricked into handing over data such as bank details.\nMs Hart said some of those placing the codes were likely to be at the bottom of a hierarchy of organised criminals and may not be aware of the implications of their actions.\nAction Fraud statistics obtained by the BBC's Shared Data Unit suggest a rapid growth in this kind of scam, with recorded incidents more than doubling in the UK between 2023 and 2024.\nOver the past five years, Action Fraud received almost 3,000 reports in total, with a fifth of those linked to the Metropolitan Police force area.\nMilton Haworth used his mobile phone to scan a QR code at a council-run car park in Castleford, West Yorkshire.\nIt directed him to download an unauthorised app, from which he agreed a 90p fee to verify bank details.\nBut instead of paying to park, he found himself signed up to a subscription service with a \u00a339 yearly fee and no refunds offered.\n\"I'd assumed I'd paid for my parking but realised it was a scam when I noticed the next day that \u00a339 had gone out of my account,\" he said.\n\"The sign said to use the code to park and I hadn't ever heard of QR codes being used as a scam.\"\nMr Haworth blames the spike in cases on authorities \"not taking this seriously enough\".\nHe said: \"Nobody seems to care, there doesn't seem to be anyone trying to find these people.\n\"It's incumbent on the authorities to go after them but I don't think they do because it's small amounts taken, not multimillions.\n\"But if it's \u00a339 a month, what if there's a million people being duped?\"\nMs Hart said victims often lost small amounts initially as those responsible gathered the data they needed to launch a \"secondary scam\".\n\"You might lose \u00a32.99 and a lot of people won't report that and don't realise they've passed on their information to a criminal organisation,\" Ms Hart said.\n\"Days or weeks later, they get a call telling them they've been the victim of a fraud and they can pinpoint a day, because they already have all of the information you shared with them earlier.\n\"They convince you using very coercive tactics that they're from your bank, police or Trading Standards and they want to take everything you've got.\"\nExperts including the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre say it is vital that people \"stay vigilant to cyber criminals\".\nKirsty Blackman, Scottish National Party MP for Aberdeen North, spoke to the BBC after removing fake QR codes from parking machines in the city.\nShe said tackling the problem was \"genuinely difficult\", adding: \"Organised criminals are there to make money in whatever way they can and I think they'll scam people whatever we do. It's about trying to whack the moles as they pop up.\"\nShe said the more victims filed reports with Action Fraud, the better police could take action.\n\"QR codes can be really useful,\" she said. \"My kids' school sends them out regularly to share information, for example. That's why it's difficult for people to tell the difference between a legitimate code and a fake one.\n\"When you're scanning a code to pay for something, that's when you really need to stop and think.\"\nJoe Hall's girlfriend inadvertently scanned a fraudulent QR code when trying to pay for parking in Luton before Christmas.\nThe couple now refuse to use QR codes after \u00a3400 was taken from her bank account the next day.\nMr Hall said: \"I drove back to the car park and found the code she scanned was a sticker. They print them so everything's the same font and colours as the signage and it blends in.\n\"If you know what you're looking for, you might spot it but a lot of the time, you might not even think about it.\n\"It's so easy for them to make money out of it - there were four others behind my girlfriend doing the same thing as she did.\n\"She got her money back but that's not always the case. They could easily just empty your bank account.\"\nNational Car Parks, which runs 800 car parking sites across the UK, is considering removing QR codes from its signage.\nIt said a \"rigorous process\" had already been introduced to prevent its QR codes being compromised, with signs inspected and codes checked every day.\nA spokesman said two of its car parks had been targeted by scammers and the business was \"reviewing options\" to reduce the impact of fraudulent QR codes.\nHe said: \"This could include removing a QR code from our signage that directs customers to a payment page, and instead emphasising the use of our website.\n\"We understand the value of QR codes and will still look to use them where we can safely.\"\nDet Supt Gary Miles, head of the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, encouraged users to \"stay alert\" to signs of fraudulent codes.\n\"You should stop and check before scanning one,\" he said. \"If you're in person, check for signs it has been tampered with, or online, look out for phishing emails or rogue social media posts with QR codes.\n\"We know that QR codes can be used in all aspects of life, online and in-person, however this doesn't stop fraudsters finding new ways to target members of the public.\"\nMore about this story\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nRead more about the Local News Partnerships here.",

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

        "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.\nBut now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.\nThe White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \n\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.\nThat framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. \nSo was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?\nIt didn't take long for Trump's aides \u2013 many of the same people who said he would never back down \u2013 to fan out and celebrate the president's move.\nTrade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\".\n\"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\"\nThey were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?\nUltimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.\nEarlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. \nIn the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.\nHe insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".\n\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.\nIn the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. \nThe reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. \nIt is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.\nThat will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions.\nThe big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week \u2013 setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order \u2013 will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. \nAnd in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

How is that going to affect the player loading and recovery?\"\nQualifying for a World Cup does not guarantee that federations will fully support their women's teams, with the 2023 edition featuring a number of teams, such as Jamaica, who faced battles off the pitch and publicly criticised their federation over facilities and preparation.\nBardsley said there must be a \"real emphasis on developing the game\" if the tournament expands to 48 teams.\n\"There is time but it's going to have to really be prioritised and accelerated,\" she said.\nFifa launched its Women's Football Strategy in 2018 and set a goal of having 60 million girls and women playing football across the globe by 2027.\nWithin its objectives, Fifa aims to ensure all 211 of its members have comprehensive women's football strategies.\nThrough its Women's Development Programme, Fifa also offers its members the opportunity to apply for and access additional resources and specialist expertise to develop women's football.\n\"It's going to be a tall order, but if Fifa serious about this investing in the women's game now, you'll see a massive benefit by 2035,\" Bardsley said.\nFor the teams who do qualify, Fifa has previously promised to match the prize money on offer at the men's World Cup for the 2027 tournament.\nThe first time we will see a 48-team tournament is next year's men's World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the US.\nAt first, Fifa suggested a group-stage format that included 16 groups of three teams, with the top two from each group going through.\nBut that caused controversy because the sides playing in the final group game could play out a result that enabled both to go through at the expense of the other team.\nAfter widespread criticism and a thrilling four-team group stage in Qatar at the 2022 men's World Cup, Fifa revised its plans.\nThe 48 teams will be drawn into 12 groups of four with the top two from each - along with the eight best third-placed nations - advancing to a 32-team knockout stage.\nThere has been no indication yet as to whether a women's tournament would follow the same format.\nThe number of games will rise from 64 in a 32-team competition to 104 with 48 teams, which is likely to mean a longer tournament.\nThe 2026 men's World Cup is set to last 10 days longer than in 2022.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect \u2013 and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.\nNear the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%.  Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.\nThis is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US. \nExports to the US contribute around 30% of Vietnam's GDP, and 25% of Cambodia's.\nThat growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.\nThe longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular.\nVietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\", where it attempts to be friends with everyone and balance ties with both China and the US, will now be tested.\nUnder the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. It has been aiming for annual growth rates in excess of 8%.\nExporting more to the US, already its biggest market, was central to that plan.\nIt was also the main reason why Vietnam agreed to elevate their relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.\nThe Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent and has no formal political opposition, depends on its economic pledges for its legitimacy. Already viewed by many economists as too ambitious, these will now be even harder to meet.\nThailand depends on US exports less than Vietnam \u2013 under 10% of GDP \u2013 but the Thai economy is in much worse shape, having underperformed for the past decade. The Thai government is trying to find ways to lift economic growth, most recently attempting but failing to legalise gambling, and these tariffs are another economic blow it cannot afford.\nFor Cambodia, the tariffs pose perhaps the greatest political threat in the region.\nThe government of Hun Manet has proved just as authoritarian as that of his father Hun Sen, whom he succeeded two years ago, but it is vulnerable.\nKeeping the Hun family's hold on power has required offering rival clans in Cambodia economic privileges like monopolies or land concessions, but this has helped create a glut of property developments, which are no longer selling, and a mass of grievances over land expropriations.\nThe garment sector, which employs 750,000 people, has been a crucial social safety valve, giving steady incomes to Cambodia's poorest. Thousands of those jobs are now likely to be lost as a result of President Trump's tariffs.\nUnlike China, which has hit back with its own levies, the official message from governments in South East Asia is don't panic, don't retaliate, but negotiate.\nVietnam has dispatched deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc to Washington to plead his country's case, and has offered to eliminate all tariffs on US imports. Thailand plans to send its finance minister to make a similar appeal, and has offered to reduce its tariffs and buy more American products, like food and aircraft. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also heading to Washington, though with  exports to the US making up only 11% of Malaysia's total, his country is less affected than some of its neighbours. \nHowever, the Trump administration appears to be in no mood to compromise.\nPeter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing and one of the main thinkers behind the new policy, said in interviews on Monday that Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs was meaningless, because it would not address the deficit in trade where Vietnam sells $15 worth of goods to the US for every $1 it buys.\nHe accused Vietnam of keeping multiple non-tariff barriers to US imports, and said that one-third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products, trans-shipped through Vietnam.\nThe proportion of Vietnamese exports which are being made or trans-shipped there to avoid US tariffs on China is difficult to assess, but detailed trade studies put it at between 7% and 16%, not one-third.\nLike Vietnam, the government of Cambodia has appealed to the US to postpone the tariffs while it attempts to negotiate.\nThe local American Chamber of Commerce has called for the 49% tariffs to be dropped, making the point that the Cambodian garment industry, the country's biggest employer, will be badly affected, but that no tariff level, however high, will see clothing and footwear manufacturing return to the US.\nPerhaps the most perverse tariff rate is the 44% applied to Myanmar, a country mired in a civil war, which has no capacity to buy more US goods.\nUS exports make up only a small proportion of Myanmar's GDP, less than 1%.\nBut as in Cambodia, that sector, mainly garments, is one of the few that provides a steady income to poor families in Myanmar's cities.\nIn a supreme irony,  Trump has until now been a popular figure in this region.\nHe has been widely admired in Vietnam for his tough, transactional approach to foreign policy, and Cambodia's former strongman Hun Sen, still the main power behind the scenes, has long sought a close personal relationship with the US president, proudly posting selfies with him at their first meeting in 2017.\nOnly last month Cambodia was praising  Trump for shutting down the US media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which often carried the views of Cambodian dissidents.\nNow Cambodia, like so many of its neighbours, finds itself in a long line of supplicants pleading with him to ease their tariff burden.",

        "article_text": "A photographer's iconic shot of polar bears in abandoned buildings on a Russian island shines a spotlight on wider changes in their behaviour.\nIn September 2021, Russian wildlife photographer Dmitry Kokh and his team were sailing around the wild and remote Chukotka Peninsula in Russia's extreme northeast. They were hoping to visit Wrangel Island, a well-known gathering place for polar bears, when the weather turned.\n\"We faced a heavy storm, with super-strong wind and waves, and we tried to find a place to shelter from the storm because the boat was small,\" Kokh recalls. They sheltered near the rocky shore of a small, uninhabited island called Kolyuchin, home to an abandoned Soviet-era weather station \u2013 and made an unexpected discovery.\n\"We saw some movement on the island, took out our binoculars, and saw polar bears roaming around there, many of them, maybe 15 or 20,\" Kokh says. \"We were super surprised because we never expected to meet polar bears so far to the south. At this time of the year, they should be on the sea ice already, and on Wrangel Island, normally.\"\u00a0\nThe weather station on Kolyuchin had been abandoned in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Stepping on the island to take pictures of the bears was too dangerous. Instead, Kokh used a drone, taking his time to get the bears used to it, then slowly flying it closer. As he was watching them, he noticed something else: there were bears inside some of the houses.\n\"I realised that it was a perfect setting for photography, because these houses are super photogenic, they are old and ruined, and animals looking out of these houses, is a perfect picture,\" he says. \"And the weather was terrible, [there was] wind and rain and fog, which is also very good for photography! So everything came together.\"\u00a0\nOne of the photos captures a bear in the entrance to the weather station, and another one looking out of the window. Titled\u00a0\"House of Bears\", it won Kokh the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, given out annually by the Natural History Museum in London. \"It's the best picture I've ever taken, and I think I won't be able to repeat it, ever,\" he says.\nTom Smith, a\u00a0professor\u00a0of wildlife sciences at Brigham Young University in Utah, has spent decades conducting field work among bears, including polar bears, and says it's not unusual to see polar bears in abandoned buildings. \"They're curious animals so we see them in structures often, or they will be climbing on top of cars or pipelines,\" he explains. There has, however, been a more worrying trend across the Arctic, he says: as the sea ice melts, polar bears are increasingly approaching or wandering into inhabited towns or villages, to feed on open rubbish dumps. \"They are fatefully drawn towards human settlements,\" says Smith, and this can result in conflict with humans.\nThe problem is two-fold, according to Smith. One is that isolated, northern communities often use open rubbish pits near the village. Securing garbage so it can't be accessed, for example in bear-proof bins and enclosed landfills, is expensive, he points out \u2013 and in the past, was not necessary. \"The overwhelming Western influence in the north has resulted in [throwaway] economies that never existed there,\" he says. \"Those cultures never had a throwaway society, so the notion of having to secure garbage \u2013 that's a new thing.\"\nSecondly, Smith notes that polar bears are spending more time on land due to the climate-change-driven loss of sea ice. They are also shifting their dens from the ice onto the land, to avoid the risk of denning on the increasingly unstable sea ice, research in northern Alaska shows. Without the sea ice, the bears can't hunt for their preferred, ideal diet of blubber-rich seals, and may resort to land-based food, be it prey or rubbish.\n\"So we have a prediction that more and more bears are coming onto the land, they are increasingly hungry and drawn to these pits,\" Smith says. The rubbish pits tend to be close to the villages. \"Because of that, we can expect more and more conflict with bears,\" he warns.\nHe emphasises that polar bear attacks on humans are very rare. According to one study, across more than a century, from 1870 to 2014, there were only 73 attacks by wild polar bears on humans, distributed among the five countries with polar bears: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States. Twenty of the attacks were deadly, and 63 caused injuries. (Because the attacks often involved more than one person, the total number of deaths and injuries is higher than the number of attacks.) Smith says that humans are not part of bears' natural diet \u2013 in contrast to big cats such as tigers and lions, who do see humans as potential food. \"That is a global myth, that [polar bears] are the only bear that stalks and kills humans,\" he says.\nNevertheless, there have been cases where polar bears have attacked people, with malnourished male bears most likely to pose a threat to humans. In some cases, starving polar bears who have become used to human-provided food\u00a0may then see humans as prey, research suggests. Smith says it's the increasing proximity to humans that's the problem, rather than the bears hunting humans as such: \"The [bears] are there for the garbage, and then they will spin off into the village and of course they're quite capable of ripping doors and windows off. So we've seen an uptick in these confrontations,\" he says.\u00a0\nA 2022 research paper warns that food from human sources \u2013 especially waste \u2013 is an emerging threat to polar bears. The supply of such human-provided food including from dumps is growing, according to the paper. As a consequence, some communities in the Arctic have seen startling incursions of dozens of polar bears. The study notes that when given the choice between sea ice, and rubbish dumps on land, polar bears still prefer the sea ice \u2013 suggesting that they are resorting to the dumps out of necessity.\u00a0\nFor example, in 2019, 60 polar bears gathered at a dump near the village of Ryrkaypiy in the Chukotka region of Russia, a few 100 metres from the village, according to the study. The bears also entered the village, causing alarm, and forcing the villagers to cancel public events and keep their children at home. However, once the sea ice formed and thickened, the polar bears left the land and returned to the sea.\u00a0\nIn Novaya Zemlya, a remote Russian archipelago, a similar invasion of 52 polar bears happened in 2019, according to the study. \"Although polar bears had visited the dump in previous years, this event was unprecedented,\" the researchers note, and was likely due to the loss of sea ice. In Arviat, an Inuit community in Nunavut, Canada, the number of polar bears using the local open dump has grown each year since record keeping began in the 1960s.\u00a0\nSpending more time on land could threaten the bears' long-term survival, Smith says, as the marine diet is more suited to them. In particular, the high fat content of their preferred prey, seals, is crucial for their health. Fat, in the form of seal blubber, makes up around 70% of polar bears' natural diet on the sea ice. It contains twice the energy per gramme as muscle. In fact, when catching a seal, the bears mostly eat the blubber and leave the meat behind. To capture seals, the bears need sea ice \u2013 they stalk the seals on the ice, or wait by breathing holes in the ice for seals to appear. Over the past 50 years, as the sea ice has shrunk, the number of polar bears has fallen, studies show.\u00a0\n\"They're using [the fat from the seal] for everything: growth, maintenance, reproduction, keeping their body warm,\" says Smith. \"They just need a seal and some water and they're fine. They're unusual animals,\" he adds. They can subsist on this high-fat, seal-based diet without suffering any nutritional deficits, he says: \"It's a metabolic marvel\".\nWhen they can't access seals and instead resort to less fatty prey on land, such as Arctic birds, bird eggs, or food from dumps, the bears' health and reproduction rates decline, and they risk starvation, studies suggest. Polar bears on land lose around one kilogramme of body mass a day, research shows.\u00a0\n\"Part of the problem we have with climate change is the scale of change is so rapid,\" says Smith. There's not enough time for the highly specialised polar bears, who evolved to thrive on a diet of marine mammals, to adapt to permanently being on land again, he warns: \"We're fearful this animal can't possibly adapt back to a land-based, herbivorous diet.\" If they had to be on land constantly, \"as a species, they would die\", he says.\u00a0\nSmith and other researchers are appealing to governments to provide funding to help secure rubbish dumps near coastal villages from bears. \"It's extremely expensive. They need help. It wouldn't be asking too much to secure the garbage and make it safer for people, and for bears,\" he says. Otherwise, people confronted with growing numbers of bears in their villages may kill them to stay safe, he warns: \"It is extremely unfortunate to see bears die from such a preventable cause [as unsecured garbage].\"\nIn the town of Churchill, Canada, closing an open dump, along with other measures, decreased damage and human injury.

In a video call, he shows a wealth of artwork and even tattoos which people made as the photos went viral.\u00a0\n\"This was an absolutely crazy time, because I got so many emails and interview requests, and many people were talking to me about these images. And they were saying something like: 'this is a post-apocalyptic picture, this is how our planet will look like if we continue to do the same things with the planet and won't change our ways',\" he says.\nFor Kokh, the award-winning photos of the polar bears opened many doors, and he has been on other expeditions to take photos of many kinds of marine wildlife. But as he reflects on that storm-swept journey to Chukotka, he comes back to the relationship between people and polar bears. For a start, even in that incredibly remote, wild region, you come across human rubbish, he says: \"What you see in this area of Russian Arctic, it's abandoned barrels, fuel barrels. It's a commonly known problem because in the Soviet Union they brought thousands of fuel barrels and abandoned them, because it was expensive to bring them back. And they still lie there, and polar bears are roaming around them.\" In the photo series of the abandoned weather station, for example, there is a shot of the bears standing in a landscape of scattered barrels.\u00a0\nBut Kokh also points out that the images can be interpreted in different ways \u2013 as a warning about our impact on the planet, but also, as testimony to the power and resilience of nature.\u00a0\n\"When I was taking the picture, I was thinking about the striking contrast between the living animals, and these destroyed buildings,\" he says, and holds up a bottle, and a cup: \"You know, all the things we make \u2013 this bottle, this cup \u2013 all the things made by humans, will be destroyed one day and will cease to exist, if we don't continue to make them. If humanity will fail, nothing will remain of us. But life will still exist.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He also urged Indian investors to do more to support Indian creators.\nBut he seemed to want to see more happen, and faster.\n\"We have to be willing to evolve and learn. [If] we want to be bigger and better, then we have to be bolder and we should not fight shy of the competition,\" the minister said.\nAt one point, he asked the audience - brimming with entrepreneurs and investors - \"Do we want to make ice creams or [semiconductor] chips?\"\nAadit Palicha, co-founder of the quick-commerce app Zepto, was quick to call out the minister.\nIn a post on X, he argued that it was consumer internet companies like his that have led innovation in the technology space, in India and globally.\nHe pointed out that Amazon - originally a consumer internet company - had scaled cloud computing while the big players in AI today, like Facebook and Google, were once consumer internet companies too.\nHe urged Indian investors to support consumer internet companies so that they can grow and use their profits for making more ambitious innovations.\nMohandas Pai, a prominent angel investor, told news channel Economic Times Now that there was a dearth of capital investment in deep-tech start-ups from the government and private players.\nHe explained that investors made a beeline for lifestyle-focused start-ups because they gave quick returns.\nDeep-tech innovations take a long time to develop and require expensive infrastructure. \"People are not willing to take long-term risks. We need long-term 'patient' money [for deep tech start-ups to thrive],\" he said.\nHe also said that regulatory curbs on foreign investments in Indian start-ups were hurting innovation.\n\"Deep tech start-ups also struggle to find a market,\" he added, citing the example of an Indian firm that recently pioneered a quick-charging battery for buses but found no takers for its product.\nMany social media users also spoke about the challenges they faced when they tried to start their own tech businesses.\nSome said they struggled to get loans, others highlighted high import taxes on certain foreign raw materials and equipment, while some others spoke about unnecessary red tape that made getting documents and approvals a nightmare.\nBut some entrepreneurs also defended the minister, saying that his comments were well-intentioned and a much-needed reality-check for the start-up ecosystem.\nVironika S, founder of edtech app Proxy Gyan, agreed that India's future leadership of the global economy depended on breakthroughs in AI and semiconductors but added that there were realistic barriers to doing so and that the government could help by easing them.\nIndian investor Kushal Bhagia said in a post on X that Goyal was right about ambition and a lack of deep tech start-ups in India. \"We just don't meet enough founders who are doing something truly deep tech or going after big ambitious problem statements,\" he said.\nHe attributed this to India's tech talent leaving the country to work in US firms and to a dearth of deep-tech founders for people to learn from and be inspired by.\nThe minister's comments also got the media analysing different journeys of Indian and Chinese start-ups.\nJournalist Abhijeet Kumar wrote in the Business Standard newspaper that in 2023, just 5% of Indian start-up funding went into deep-tech sectors, compared to 35% in China. He also pointed out how Beijing actively promoted high-tech innovation - in 2024, it had slashed $361bn in taxes and fees for high-tech firms, including $80.7bn in research and development deductions.\nIn an editorial published on Monday, the newspaper also noted that India's start-ups are more consumption-driven, focused on using technology to solve local problems at scale rather than global ones by creating path-breaking foundational models. \nIt pointed out that India currently had 4,000 deep-tech start-ups and that this number was expected to jump to 10,000 by 2030 and quoted a Nasscom report which said that India's deep tech-start-ups attracted $1.6bn in funding in 2024, marking a 78% year-on-year increase.\nBut there's still a long way to go.\n\"As the deep-tech race intensifies globally, it is clear that India will have to do a lot to catch up with these countries,\" the editorial said, adding that Goyal's comments should \"serve as a call to action\" for start-ups and investors and also for the government.\n\"This can include setting up deep-tech innovation funds, building strong academia-start-up bridges and offering incentives for faster developments in hardware, AI, biotech and clean energy,\" it said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "The Duke of Sussex was \"singled out for different, unjustified and inferior treatment\" in a decision to downgrade the level of security he receives in the UK, the Court of Appeal has heard.\nPrince Harry is making his latest legal challenge after the High Court upheld the decision that he should not be provided with the same level of police protection given to working members of the Royal Family.\nHis barrister Shaheed Fatima KC told the court Prince Harry had been subject to a \"different and so-called bespoke process\" in that original decision.\nBut Sir James Eadie KC, representing the Home Office, said the appeal case puts forward arguments based on \"small parts of the evidence\".\nPrince Harry sat on Tuesday with a notepad and pen in the back row of the court, next to his solicitor and behind his barristers. He did not give evidence.\nThe prince's case is challenging the way the Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, took the decision on his security arrangements after he stepped down from being a working royal in 2020.\nIn written submissions to the court today, his barrister said the duke and his wife \"felt forced to step back from the role of full time official working members of the Royal Family as they considered they were not being protected by the institution\".\nThe duke's security in the UK is currently decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country's other high-profile visitors.\nPrince Harry has previously said that the safety of his family, with whom he moved to California in 2020, was at the heart of the case.\n\"The UK is central to the heritage of my children,\" he told the High Court in December 2023, adding that he wanted them to feel at home here. \"That cannot happen if it's not possible to keep them safe.\"\nRegarding his current security arrangements in the UK, Ms Fatima told the court he does not accept that \"bespoke\" means \"better\".\nBecause the Home Office has legal responsibility for Ravec's decisions, it is opposing the appeal on its behalf.\nMr Eadie, representing the Home Office, said the previous judge could accept \"that the bespoke process was better suited\" to Harry's circumstances.\nHe said it was \"important to emphasise\" that the security previously given to the prince had not been fully revoked.\nHe said, instead, it had been decided that the security \"would not be provided on the same basis as before\" due to the duke's \"change of status\" and his moving abroad.\nMs Fatima told the court on Tuesday that Ravec had not followed its own standard procedures, because it chose to downgrade his security without having expert analysis of the risks he faced.\nShe argued that the previous judge was wrong to have concluded that the committee could make decisions without such analysis.\nShe also said the prince's case was not that he should \"automatically be entitled to the same protection as he was previously given\".\nRather, Ms Fatima said, his legal submissions argued that he should have been told how the decisions about his security were being made.\nPrince Harry claimed he had not been given the chance to make his own case or see risk assessments that might have been carried out.\nHe also referenced security incidents that have happened since his security was downgraded.\nThese include al-Qaeda calling for the prince to be murdered in 2020, and a \"dangerous car pursuit with paparazzi\" in New York in 2023.\nIn written submissions, Mr Eadie said the prince's appeal involved \"a continued failure to see the wood for the trees\".\nHe added that Prince Harry's argument was based on \"only reading small parts\" of the evidence and the previous judgement, and doing so \"out of context and ignoring the totality of the picture\".\nMr Eadie said Ravec had treated the claimant \"in a bespoke manner\", adding: \"He is no longer a member of the cohort of individuals whose security position remains under regular review by Ravec.\"\nSir James added: \"This approach was at all times a matter for the expert judgment of Ravec and the judge was right to find that it was lawful.\"\nIn 2023, Prince Harry also lost a legal challenge in his bid to be allowed to make private payments for police protection.\nWhile most of the proceedings are set to be held in open court, confidential information about security arrangements and threat levels will be heard in private.\nThe two-day hearing will continue on Wednesday.

        "summary": "Prince Harry's downgraded security was unjustified, court hears6 hours agoShareSaveAmy WalkerBBC NewsJemma Crew & Tom SymondsBBC NewsReporting fromthe Court of AppealShareSaveWatch: Prince Harry arrives at Court of AppealThe Duke of Sussex was \"singled out for different, unjustified and inferior treatment\" in a decision to downgrade the level of security he receives in the UK, the Court of Appeal has heard.Prince Harry is making his latest legal challenge after the High Court upheld the decision that he should not be provided with the same level of police protection given to working members of the Royal Family.His barrister Shaheed Fatima KC told the court Prince Harry had been subject to a \"different and so-called bespoke process\" in that original decision.But Sir James Eadie KC, representing the Home Office, said the appeal case puts forward arguments based on \"small parts of the evidence\".Prince Harry sat on Tuesday with a notepad and pen in the back row of the court, next to his solicitor and behind his barristers. \"Regarding his current security arrangements in the UK, Ms Fatima told the court he does not accept that \"bespoke\" means \"better\".What are Harry and Meghan's UK security arrangements, and where do they get their money?Because the Home Office has legal responsibility for Ravec's decisions, it is opposing the appeal on its behalf.Mr Eadie, representing the Home Office, said the previous judge could accept \"that the bespoke process was better suited\" to Harry's circumstances.He said it was \"important to emphasise\" that the security previously given to the prince had not been fully revoked.He said, instead, it had been decided that the security \"would not be provided on the same basis as before\" due to the duke's \"change of status\" and his moving abroad.Ms Fatima told the court on Tuesday that Ravec had not followed its own standard procedures, because it chose to downgrade his security without having expert analysis of the risks he faced.She argued that the previous judge was wrong to have concluded that the committee could make decisions without such analysis.She also said the prince's case was not that he should \"automatically be entitled to the same protection as he was previously given\".Rather, Ms Fatima said, his legal submissions argued that he should have been told how the decisions about his security were being made.Prince Harry claimed he had not been given the chance to make his own case or see risk assessments that might have been carried out.He also referenced security incidents that have happened since his security was downgraded.These include al-Qaeda calling for the prince to be murdered in 2020, and a \"dangerous car pursuit with paparazzi\" in New York in 2023.In written submissions, Mr Eadie said the prince's appeal involved \"a continued failure to see the wood for the trees\".He added that Prince Harry's argument was based on \"only reading small parts\" of the evidence and the previous judgement, and doing so \"out of context and ignoring the totality of the picture\".Mr Eadie said Ravec had treated the claimant \"in a bespoke manner\", adding: \"He is no longer a member of the cohort of individuals whose security position remains under regular review by Ravec. He did not give evidence.The prince's case is challenging the way the Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, took the decision on his security arrangements after he stepped down from being a working royal in 2020.In written submissions to the court today, his barrister said the duke and his wife \"felt forced to step back from the role of full time official working members of the Royal Family as they considered they were not being protected by the institution\".The duke's security in the UK is currently decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country's other high-profile visitors.Prince Harry has previously said that the safety of his family, with whom he moved to California in 2020, was at the heart of the case. \"That cannot happen if it's not possible to keep them safe. \"In 2023, Prince Harry also lost a legal challenge in his bid to be allowed to make private payments for police protection.While most of the proceedings are set to be held in open court, confidential information about security arrangements and threat levels will be heard in private.The two-day hearing will continue on Wednesday.",

He wants people to know that he's edgy and dark and I'm, I don't know, like I watch reality TV.\"\nWhite continued: \"We never really even fought. He says we feuded. I don't think I ever had a fight with him \u2013 except for maybe some emails.\"\nWhite continued: \"It was basically me giving him notes. I don't think he liked to go through the process of getting notes from me, or wanting revisions, because he didn't respect me. \n\"I knew he wasn't a team player and that he wanted to do it his way. I was thrown that he would go to the New York Times to [criticise] me and the show three days before the finale.\"\nFollowing the interview with Stern, De Veer told BBC News: \"When Mike learned that I wasn't coming back for series four, he didn't handle it in a normal business manner, with a cool head, that is why I went public.\"\nHe added: \"Everything that is happening right now is completely unnecessary, I didn't start this feud and am simply defending myself.\"\nDe Veer added: \"Every comment regarding the role of the composer and the music at the Stern show simply proves my point that he doesn't understand or fully appreciate the importance and the power of the music in The White Lotus. \n\"I wasn't given the trust about musical decisions, which you would imagine come with the success of the score. Which is also why I'm not returning.\"\nDe Veer won three Emmy Awards for The White Lotus, including outstanding theme for season one.\nSome fans expressed disappointment that the show's theme changed for season three, losing its famous \"ooh-loo-loo-loo\" vocal hook.\nDe Veer said he tried to persuade producers to release a full version of the season three theme including the vocals, but said White refused.\nWhite told Stern: \"By the time the third season came around, he'd won Emmys and he had his song go viral, he didn't want to go through the process with me, he didn't want to go to sessions.\n\"He would always look at me with this contemptuous smirk on his face like he thought I was a chimp or something... he's definitely making a big deal out of a creative difference.\"\nIn response, De Veer drew attention to the career he had \"long before the White Lotus\", which saw him win other awards including a Bafta and a Royal Television Society Award. \nIn his original comments to the New York Times, De Veer said: \"Maybe I was being unprofessional, and for sure Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn't give him what he wanted.\"\nThe third season of The White Lotus, which is set in wealthy hotels and focuses on rich guests and the staff who serve them, received mixed reviews from critics.\nThe Guardian described the finale as \"the show's least satisfying ending ever\" in a three-star review. The Independent agreed it was a \"a violent end to a bad season\", while the Standard said it was \"heartwarming, frequently heartbreaking and, often, frustrating\".\nThe Telegraph was more positive, awarding the last episode four stars and describing it as \"a dark, uncomfortable finale, but one that forced the audience to ponder the very meaning of happiness\".\nThe latest season starred British actors Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood alongside Walton Goggins, Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Parker Posey. \nSunday's final episode was watched by 6.2 million viewers in the US. \nIn the UK, the show has been attracting about 1.5 million viewers per episode, including catch-up.\nIt has also received huge pick-up on social media, with some scenes being made into memes and gifs, while fans have speculated on relationships between cast members.",

Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

So he delayed saying farewell to a place that means so much to him.\n\"They're the two most important wins in my career,\" he said of his 1985 and 1993 victories at Augusta, which are his sole major triumphs.\n\"It's emotional. You can tell already my voice is breaking a bit just realising it's going to be my last competitive Masters.\"\nLanger has conceded for many years that he no longer has the game to compete at Augusta; three missed cuts in his past three Masters are testament to that.\n\"The course is just getting too long and I'm getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \n\"I'm hitting hybrids [into greens] where the other kids are hitting nine-irons, maybe even wedges. So I knew I wasn't going to be in contention anymore.\n\"A few years back I asked the chairman of the club, 'is there a time limit? Do we age out when we're 60?'. He said, 'no, you will know when it's time to quit, it's totally up to you'.\n\"It is time to quit.\"\nLyle, Langer, Woosnam, Olazabal, Ballesteros and Faldo were victorious at Augusta National in an extraordinary era of success for European golf\nLanger was runner-up at The Open twice and third on three occasions in a career that promised more major success.\nThat he was unable to add a major other than his two at Augusta only intensifies his link to this fabled corner of Georgia.\nIn 40 appearances, he has made the cut 27 times and finished inside the top 10 nine times.\n\"It's been an incredible journey, for a young man born in a village of 800 people [in Bavaria, southern Germany], where golf was nothing, to make it here,\" he said.\n\"To get an invitation to play the Masters when it was extremely difficult for European or international players to get one, and then to win the Masters on the third go was just a dream come true.\"\nHe was just the third non-American winner, following in the footsteps of South Africa's three-time champion Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who won twice. \nHis win cemented belief among Europeans that success could be achieved at Augusta.\nBallesteros paved the way with his victories in 1980 and 1983, before Langer won his first two years later. \nThen Scotland's Sandy Lyle, England's Nick Faldo (twice) Wales' Ian Woosnam, Langer again and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal collected six of seven titles from 1988.\nLanger's debut was in 1982, two years after Ballesteros had broken the glass ceiling. \nThe German's initial experience was hardly noteworthy. He shot 77 and 78 to miss the halfway cut by one stroke after three-putting 11 times in 36 holes on unfamiliar greens that were too slick for a naive 24-year-old.\n\"Coming here the first time, driving down Magnolia Lane, seeing this place for the first time was an eye-opener,\" he said. \n\"I had never seen a golf course manicured like this or a tournament run as efficiently as this has been.\"\nBy the time Langer won his second title in 1993, he was married with three children\nHe vowed to come back better prepared and when he returned two years later he made it through to the weekend - the first of an incredible run of 19 successive Masters that Langer would play all four rounds.\nHis victory 12 months later was secured with a classic back-nine Augusta charge. He birdied four out of six holes from the 12th as he overturned a three-shot deficit to Curtis Strange, who dropped shots on three of his final five holes.\nLanger bogeyed the 18th but still beat Strange, Ray Floyd and his playing partner Ballesteros by two shots.\nHe made a solid defence of his title in 1986 and briefly shared the lead in the final round before Jack Nicklaus produced a back nine for the ages to clinch his record-extending sixth Green Jacket and 18th major title.\nThat week was also memorable for witnessing the first time a world ranking was published, and it was Langer who had the honour of topping the inaugural list.\nHe was becoming something of an Augusta specialist and the love affair strengthened with two more top 10s before he claimed his second victory in 1993.\nLanger was challenged by unheralded American Dan Forsman in the final round. \nForsman was one shot behind the German when he teed off on the notoriously tricky par-three 12th. He dumped two balls in the water, walked off with a quadruple-bogey seven and was barely heard of again.\nIn contrast, Langer's name continued to pepper the leaderboards at Augusta, with top 10s in 1997, 2001 and 2004. \nHe finished joint eighth at the age of 56 in 2014 and held the record for the oldest player to make the cut - at the age of 63 in 2020 - until Fred Couples eclipsed that in 2023.\nThis is Langer's final Masters but not the end of competitive golf for the former Ryder Cup captain, who looks as fit as he did in his pomp.\nHe shows no signs of slowing down on the PGA Tour Champions - the US-based seniors tour - and has racked up at least one victory a year since joining the circuit in 2007 when he turned 50. \nHe has won 12 majors among 47 senior victories - both of which are records.\nThis week he is back among the game's youthful elite though, and will seek to end his Masters career with the same controlled elegance with which he has played throughout his career.\nHe will not contend for the title. That is clear. Instead, the question is whether his Masters career ends after round two on Friday, or if he defies his own expectations and makes the cut.\n\"After four decades it's going to be bittersweet,\" he said.\n\"When I'm inside the ropes, my mind switches to being a competitor, play golf and take care of the task in front of me. \n\"But I might get a bit emotional looking around, seeing my family, my kids, my grandkids, my brother and other friends that are going to be supporting me this week.\n\"I love the Masters more than any tournament in the world. I'm expecting it to be very difficult emotionally.\"",

It later closed the day's trading up 9.5%, while the Dow Jones surged by 7.8%.\nAnnouncing the latest iteration of his plan on Truth Social, Trump said he was authorising a 90-day pause on tariffs for the countries that had not retaliated against his levies.\nThe additional tariff on Beijing, he said, would be effective immediately. \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realise that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,\" he wrote.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted the change of policy had not been influenced by the global falls, but senior Democrat Chuck Schumer said the decision showed Trump was \"reeling and retreating\".\nSpeaking outside the White House, Trump later said the amendments to his tariffs policy had \"had to be done\" because people were \"getting yippy\".\n\"I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate because I told them 'if you retaliate, we're going to double it' - and that's what I did with China,\" he said, adding that he thought, \"It's all going to work out amazing.\"\nHe also said he thought Chinese President Xi Jinping was \"going to want to get to a deal\".\nIn the UK, which was not affected by the changes as it was already on the list of countries receiving the baseline 10% tariff, a No 10 spokeswoman said a \"trade war is in nobody's interests\".\nA source also said the developments in Washington showed \"cool and calm can pay off\".\nThe ongoing stand-off between China and the US - the world's two biggest economies - began when Trump announced new tariffs last week.\nChina was hit with an additional 34% tariff, on top of a 20% levy the president had put in place earlier this year. However, Beijing was quick to retaliate with a 34% tariff on US imports to China.\nIn response, Trump threatened an additional 50%, bringing the total to 104% on Tuesday, if Beijing did not back down. China did not change course and said it would \"fight to the end\" if the US \"insists on provoking a tariff war or trade war\".\nJust hours after the 104% tariffs from the US kicked in earlier, Beijing announced it would raise its own tariffs on American goods from 34% to 84% from Thursday.\nChina's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said on Wednesday the US \"continues to impose tariffs on China in an abusive manner\".\nHe said China opposes such \"bullying practices\" and the US must show \"an attitude of equality, mutual respect, and reciprocity\" if it hopes to resolve issues through negotiation.\nThe deteriorating relationship between the two nations could see their goods trade fall as much as 80% - a $466bn (\u00a3363bn) drop, according to World Trade Organization forecasts. \n\"Our assessments, informed by the latest developments, highlight the substantial risks associated with further escalation,\" Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, head of the WTO, said. \nAway from China, Trump's latest plans have not affected other recently-announced tariffs already in play.\nThese include the 25% import taxes on cars and car parts coming into the US, which came into effect on 2 April, and a further 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the European Union approved a first set of retaliatory tariffs against the US, due to take effect on 15 April. The bloc, on Trump's \"worst offender\" trading partner list, had been due to receive customised tariffs of 20%. \nBut because the EU's retaliatory tariffs had not yet gone into effect, the White House included it on the list of countries to be capped at 10%. \nMeanwhile, the so-called baseline rate never applied to Canada and Mexico - key trading partners of the US - and a White House official has said neither is in line to receive the 10% baseline tariff now.

        "article_text": "Jonathan Haidt's book, The Anxious Generation, sparked a global reckoning about mobile phone usage among children when it came out last year. So, I checked in with him to find out if he still thinks childhood is at risk from too much screen time.\nParents need help. I know from experience. It's really hard to get kids off their screens when all their friends are stuck on theirs. This addiction demands collective action.\nIn the days since I spoke with Haidt, there's been one thing that he said that I haven't been able to get off my mind.\u00a0\n\"I have not met one member of Gen Z who's in denial, who says, 'No, we love the phones, the phones are good for us,'\" Haidt told me. \"They all see what's happening, but they feel trapped.\"\u00a0\nSo, has anything actually changed in the year since Haidt's book? Was all the hype around mobile phones just a flash-in-the-pan moment of collective parental anxiety or did it produce the kind of action many parents are longing for?\nWatch our full conversation, here:\nBelow is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nKatty Kay: It's been a year since your book came out and caused a huge conversation. I wanted to start by getting a kind of report card of where we are on the various aspects of what you're trying to do: phones in school, age gating, social media, getting kids to have more free playtime. Who's doing well and who isn't in America on all of those issues?\u00a0\nJonathan Haidt: I knew that the book was going to be popular. What I wasn't prepared for is that this issue would spread like wildfire around the world, not just in the US. Because around the world, family life has turned into a fight over screen time. Everyone hates it. Everyone sees it.\nWhere it took off most quickly was phone-free schools, because that is something that is very easily done. It's so hard to teach to a classroom when half of them are watching short videos and playing video games. So, the teachers have hated the phones from the beginning but they were afraid, especially in America \u2013 maybe it's the same in the UK \u2013 but in America, there are a lot of parents who want to be able to communicate all the time with their child, and they think they have a right to check in on their child. And, 'What if something goes wrong? I need to be there.' So, the overparenting \u2014\nKK: That's a paradox, then, because you've got the parents who are super worried about the phones; they see what phones are doing to their kids. But they also don't want their kids to relinquish their phones when they go into school.\nJH: Hey, look, people are complicated! They contain multitudes. And I shouldn't say that everyone saw the problem, because there were a lot of parents who saw the phone as a lifeline. They see the world as very threatening and dangerous. And so, early on in this process, I thought there would be this uniquely American thing about overprotection, because we do have a lot more crime than you do in Europe or Canada.\u00a0\nBut the surprising thing, to me, as I've been studying this for a while now, is that the vast overprotection swept through all of the English-speaking countries in the '90s. So, all the English-speaking countries went through this at the same time. And now, all of them are taking action really quickly. UK and Australia, I'd say, are in the lead in terms of actually passing legislation.\nKK: Here in the United States, we've seen some battles go through Congress, but this has not happened at a national level. What I am seeing is individual states enact laws to stop kids having phones in school.\u00a0\nJH: That's right, because we don't have a functioning legislature in the United States. We have Congress. And Congress can't really do anything if anybody objects. So, from the beginning, I have not assumed we're going to get a damn bit of help from Congress. I've been focusing on the 50 US states and on the UK, Australia and the EU. If we get legislative change in those domains, we win.\nKK: Is it too early to see what the impact is in schools that ban phones? Do we have any data on that yet or is this just a supposition that they're going to do better?\u00a0\nJH: We have reports from schools that go phone-free. And I challenge people to look around for a school that went truly phone-free, not just during class time. If it's just a restriction during class time, that's not phone-free. That causes all kinds of problems. All the kids are on their phones in between classes. But truly phone-free, where you turn in phones in the morning and you get back in the evening, the reports are raves.\u00a0\nThe most common things they say are that discipline problems are down. There's just a lot less fighting, a lot less drama. Truancy is down. School is a lot more fun when you can actually talk with your friends and play with them and laugh with them. So, truancy goes down, tardiness goes down, kids arrive on time. And the most thrilling thing for me, and the most universal thing they say is we hear laughter in the hallways again. So, the reports are uniformly raves. There's often some resistance in the first week or two, but what they mostly say is \u2014\nKK: Who's the resistance from?\u00a0\nJH: Some of the kids don't like it and some of the parents don't like it. But I've spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school superintendents. What they're telling me is they expected a huge pushback from parents, but they actually didn't get it. Because this year is different. The zeitgeist has changed.\nActually, it started in the UK even before my book came out. You had smartphone-free schools; they went viral in February of last year and my book didn't come out until March. So, it's a different environment now, and schools are ready to act. Now, there are some studies, there are some academic studies that have been equivocal, but when you look at them \u2013 there was one that came out in the UK, it was published in the Lancet.\nIt said phone-free schools don't help. No, it didn't. It looked at like eight schools that had a backpack policy, which is not very good, and then like 11 or 15 schools that had a classroom-ban policy. It was like there was a slight difference in policies. These are very different schools. So, we have a Substack post showing this Lancet study doesn't show anything of the sort. There was a study in the UK done by Policy Exchange, where they looked at several hundred UK schools, and only about 10% are truly phone-free. If you look at the schools in the UK that are truly phone-free, and you compare them to the others, then you do find academic benefits and behavioural benefits.\nKK: I want to go back to something you said at the beginning about the 1990s and how that became a time of fear. I've been a working mother my whole life. I have four children: two of whom were born in the 90s, one was born in 2000, one was born in 2006. So, they've all had different experiences with screens. But from the research that I've done, something else happened in the kind of 80s and 90s, which was a sort of expansion of what we deem to be a good parent, and more specifically than that, a good mother, right? So, women were taking on full-time jobs and still doing the overwhelming share of household chores.\nBut it's not just that. In my research, women today are doing as much in the way of household chores as their great-grandmothers were in the early part of the 1900s. It's that society somehow deemed us not to be good parents if we weren't spending an enormous amount of time with our kids, spending our weekends running ragged taking them to events. And somehow you got, particularly perhaps if you were a working mother, the kind of guilt exploded. I feel like screens \u2013 and I've seen it with my own kids \u2013 screens just became a kind of form of relief for parents, and mothers in particular, from whom society was just asking impossible things.\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0Every word you said is true. I'll just try to add on to it. It is a puzzle. And I've got a really bizarre graph in the book showing that the amount of time that mothers and fathers spent parenting was fairly flat in the 80s and even into the 90s. And then all of a sudden in the mid 1990s, at least in the US, it jumped up. Something changed in the 90s. And it's the norm that you're talking about.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Great, I moved here in '96, so I just hit right at the right moment! [Laughter]\nJH:\u00a0You just hit it! That's right. So, that really did happen. Women today have fewer children than their grandmothers did, and they're working outside the home, which their grandmothers didn't, and they're spending more time with the kids. So, a lot of this has fallen on women.\u00a0\nNow, why did this happen? The best answer comes from this really wonderful book called Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi. He's a British sociologist and he's focusing on what happened in the UK, not the US, although he points out that the same things happened in the US and Canada. And what happened, he says, is we lost trust in other people. And when that happens, then we don't trust our neighbourhood. We don't trust people to send our kids out.\u00a0\nIt's always been the case that raising kids was kind of a joint project. When you lose that, now every family is on their own. And that means it's mostly the mothers who are on their own.\nKK:\u00a0In your sort of meta analysis of screens and kids and schools, and whether we can have phones in schools, is it actually the case that we have to address those issues before we can really wean our kids off this screen addiction?\nJH:\u00a0We have to understand those issues first if we want to fully understand what happened historically. But I would not say that we have to address those issues first, because, frankly, we're not going to address them. I mean reversing the decline of community, you know, I go to all kinds of meetings about that. There are all kinds of foundations. But look, technology changes society \u2014\nKK:\u00a0Can you just fix it all, Jon? [Laughter] I mean, I know you've done phones in schools, but really, step it up!\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0[Laughter] Yeah. Let's fix community next! So, no, we're not going to restore trust in our neighbours such that we can let our kids out. That's not going to happen. In fact, it's likely to get a lot worse as we go into the\u00a0era of AI, when we have no idea what's true. We're never going to know what's true again for a very long time, if ever. So, rather, we have to adapt to this. And I think the way we adapt to this onslaught of technology is by saying, \"Okay, you know what? Kids are not adults.\"\nWe have to focus on what it will take to allow kids to have healthy brain development through puberty. That's my mission. We've got to give kids a lot less screen time. A lot less fragmenting time. No TikTok. No short videos. That's the worst, and give them a lot more experience interacting with people.\nKK:\u00a0What do you say to poorer families where both parents have to work multiple jobs and for whom the invention of screen content that occupies their small children is just literally a lifesaver for them? Is there a different argument there or not?\nJH:\u00a0Yes, there is. So, the way to understand this is that in the 90s, when we were all techno-optimists, the internet was amazing. The early internet was amazing. And rich kids had computers and internet access and poor kids didn't. And so in the 1990s, we had a big thing, you know, it was educational equity.\u00a0Bill Gates, all kinds of philanthropists donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Let's get every kid a computer.\nSo, in the early 2000s, we're all techno-optimists and we think, 'Well, okay, I don't trust my kid to walk three blocks to a store, but he's on a computer. What could happen? He's learning! That's great!' We think it's good that our kids are upstairs on a computer. And, of course, this is one of the central ideas in the\u00a0Netflix show Adolescence\u00a0is, you know, parents think their kids are safe when they're on a computer. And in the 90s, they mostly were. There was some bad stuff, too, but they mostly were.\u00a0\nBut once the internet gets taken over, or at least once childhood gets\u00a0owned by three or four big companies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0TikTok, Snap, Meta and Google \u2013 once childhood is owned by these companies that are using algorithms to send them content, to keep them hooked, this is when things get much darker. Kids on computers now, they're not learning to program. They're not learning any useful skills. They're just basically lying there consuming content. And this is when it gets really sick and really dark.\nEditorial Note:\nTikTok told the BBC's Marianna Spring it has \"industry-leading\" safety settings for teens, and Meta cites its own tools for \"positive and age-appropriate experiences\". Read more about how social media companies address concerns of children's safety online, here.\nBut we don't quite realise that. And so what's happened now is the educational equity issue has reversed. It used to be \"get poor kids computers\". But by the 2000s, what was clear was that the rich people, and especially the people in Silicon Valley, don't let their kids have this stuff. So, now the great educational equity imperative is we've got to give the poor kids the same protections that the rich kids have. We've got to get them less time on screens. You said it's literally a lifesaver. I would say no, it's not literally a lifesaver. It literally is a brain-scrambler.\nKK: A lot of what you write about and the way you write is targeted at adults. If you were to go into schools and talk to middle school children, what would be the most effective argument you could make to them?\nJH: I'm glad you asked that, because just before our conversation, I was in an hour-long conversation with my team. We're creating a version of The Anxious Generation for 8-to-12 year olds, for kids who don't yet have a smartphone. And the main thing that we want to convey to them is that there are these companies that are going to try to hook you. And they've hooked most kids. If you look at the kids older than you, they're not having fun. They're lonely, they're sad. Because they all got sucked into just being content consumers, that's all they do. But do you want to have an amazing, exciting life? Do you want to do things? Do you want to have fun with your friends?\nDon't go down that route. Don't let these companies trick you and suck you in. One of the key ideas in The Anxious Generation is this is not a book about screens; this is a book about childhood. What kind of childhood do we want for our kids?\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "On 12 March, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was driving home with his young son in Maryland when he was stopped by agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nAgents took Mr Garcia into custody, then shuttled him to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas. \nAccording to a federal judge, after three days, \"without any notice, legal process, or hearing\", Mr Garcia found himself back in his native El Salvador at an infamous prison known for housing gang members. \nThe government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\".\nBut despite that, Mr Garcia remains incarcerated in El Salvador as lawyers debate the unusual intricacies of the case. \nA Maryland court ordered Mr Garcia be returned to the US,  but Trump officials argued that they cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr Garcia. The administration also argued that the judge ordering his return lacked the authority to do so.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on lower court orders while they consider the matter.\nImmigration experts say that as US President Donald Trump takes a hardline approach on illegal immigration, this case has the potential to upend due process  for immigrants.\n\"If the US Supreme Court were to accept [the Trump administration's] position, it would completely eviscerate any rule of law in the immigration process,\" Maureen Sweeney, director of the University of Maryland's Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, told the BBC.  \n\"Because they could pick up anybody, at any time, and send them anywhere with no repercussions whatsoever.\"\nUS District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in a filing Sunday that ICE officials did not follow procedures in the Immigration and Nationality Act when they deported Mr Garcia to El Salvador.\nShe ruled the US must bring him back before midnight on Monday. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, writing that the US \"has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street\".\nYet the Trump administration has argued that it cannot comply, saying Judge Xinis' filing is outside her jurisdiction.\n\"Neither a federal district court nor the United States has authority to tell the Government of El Salvador what to do,\" US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nNicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School said that while it is true - US district judges cannot order El Salvador to take action -  they can order the US government to have Mr Garcia returned.\nShe also said the US has previously facilitated the return of mistakenly deported individuals.\nProf Hallett also questioned the government's claim that the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr Garcia, citing an agreement between the two countries.\nThe US, under the Trump administration, paid El Salvador's government $6m to house prisoners it sends, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Top officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump himself have publicly touted the arrangement.\n\"It's almost as if the Salvadoran government is acting as an agent of the US government,\" Ms Hallett said, arguing that this makes the release more plausible.\nMr Garcia's lawyers argued that because El Salvador was detaining Mr Garcia \"at the direct request and pursuant to financial compensation\" from the US, the court could order the US government to request his return.\nThe Department of Justice, however, has resisted calls to take such action.\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that \"it was an administrative error as to why he was deported,\" but maintained the allegation that Mr Garcia belonged to a gang.\n\"We believe he should stay where he is,\" she said.\nMr Garcia is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison. Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation.\nMr Garcia, who is married to a US citizen, does not have any gang ties and has never been charged with a crime, his lawyer says.\nHe was also protected by a \"withholding of removal\" order, which means the US government cannot send him back to El Salvador because he could face harm. The order dates back to 2019, when ICE first took Mr Garcia into custody and alleged he belonged to the MS-13 criminal organisation, an allegation he denied at the time.\nSuch orders are common, immigration lawyers told the BBC, and are an alternative to asylum protections.\n\"It was an unlawful act, for the US to return him to the country where he could not be returned,\" said Amelia Wilson, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at Pace University.\nA judge ultimately granted Mr Garcia the 2019 order after he \"testified about how he was a victim of gang violence in El Salvador when he was a teenager and he came to the US to escape all of that,\" his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, wrote in a March 2025 affidavit.\nDepartment of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni acknowledged that at the time the \"government did not appeal that decision, so it is final\".\nThe Trump administration now reiterates allegations that Mr Garcia belonged to MS-13, but Judge Xinis said the government made this claim \"without any evidence\" and had not produced a removal order or warrant.\nThe Trump administration continues to press its case to the nation's highest court, setting up a potential showdown over the White House's deportation strategy.\nChief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay on Monday night, pausing lower court rulings while the US Supreme Court considers the government's appeal.\nPresident Trump touted the stay as a victory, writing on Truth Social that the ruling allowed the president \"to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself.\"\nImmigration lawyers, meanwhile, are watching Mr Garcia's case closely, considering it a test for how much power the administration can exert over US immigration.\n\"If the Trump administration is trying to remove these individuals by bypassing the immigration courts,\" said Ms Wilson, \"there's a direct and obvious line between what they're doing, and an effort by the administration to completely usurp judicial and due process.\"",

        "article_text": "Constructed by a mysterious civilisation that left no written records, the massive site is now open to the public for the first time in more than a century.\nAutumn leaves crackled under our shoes as dozens of eager tourists and I followed a guide along a grassy mound. We stopped when we reached the opening of a turf-topped circle, which was formed by another wall of mounded earth. We were at The Octagon, part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, a large network of hand-constructed hills spread throughout central and southern Ohio that were built as many as 2,000 years ago. Indigenous people would come to The Octagon from hundreds of miles away, gathering regularly for shared rituals and worship.\u00a0\n\"There was a sweat lodge or some kind of purification place there,\" said our guide, Brad Lepper, senior archaeologist for the Ohio History Connection's World Heritage Program (OHC), as he pointed to the circle. I looked inside to see a perfectly manicured lawn \u2013 a putting green. A tall flag marked a hole at its centre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's because from 1910 through 2024, The Octagon had been used as a golf course. But on 1 January 2025, this ancient, enigmatic site reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a century.\nAll these prehistoric ceremonial earthworks in Ohio were created by what is now called the Hopewell Culture, a network of Native American societies that gathered from as far away as Montana and the Gulf of Mexico between roughly 100 BCE and 500 CE and were connected by a series of trade routes. Their earthworks in Ohio consist of shapes \u2013 like circles, squares and octagons \u2013 that were often connected to each other. Archaeologists are only now beginning to understand the sophistication of these engineering marvels.\nBuilt with astonishing mathematical precision, as well as a complex astronomical alignment, these are the largest geometrical earthworks in the world that were not built as fortifications or defensive structures. And while most people have never heard about the sites or its builders, that may be about to change.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nIn 2023, eight of Hopewell's earthworks were inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site. These include The Great Circle and The Octagon in Newark, Ohio, as well Ohio's first state park, Fort Ancient (not an actual fort). The other five are part of the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park: Mound City, Hopeton Earthworks, High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group and Seip Earthworks.\u00a0\nLepper told me The Octagon and The Great Circle were once a larger, single Hopewell complex spanning 4.5 square miles and connected by a series of roads lined by earthwork walls. Walking through both sites today, there is an immediate shock of scale. The Great Circle, where the museum for Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks is found, is 1,200ft in diameter. Its walls rise up to 14ft high and are outlined on the inside by a deep ditch. The Great Circle was once connected to a square and a burial ellipse, with only part of the square still visible today.\u00a0The Octagon sprawls a massive 50 acres and is attached to the 20-acre Observatory Circle, a large earthwork circle for gathering and rituals connected to the observation of the night sky.\n\"You could put four Roman Colosseums inside just The Octagon,\" Lepper told me. \"Stonehenge would fit within just that small circle now serving as a putting green.\" He added that 2,000 years ago, Indigenous workers built these earthworks without modern tools, digging up soil with pointed sticks and hauling it in wicker baskets on their backs. One estimate, he noted, is that they moved seven million cubic feet of dirt.\u00a0\nThe achievement of the Hopewell Culture, however, is not simply in creating large, precise shapes, which they did without the vantage point of hills for an aerial view. They also embedded a sort of hidden geometry within these structures. Until the mounds were measured and compared, it was thought that the builders didn't have any mathematical and geometrical sophistication, as there are no written records to testify to their level of knowledge. It was eventually discovered, however, that they made precise measurements across their earthworks and connected them in unsuspecting ways.\u00a0\nLepper explained that the circumference of The Great Circle \"is equal to the perimeter of the perfect square that it was connected to\", and that \"the area of that perfect square is equal to the area of the [Observatory Circle] that's connected to The Octagon\".\u00a0\nHe added: \"If you draw a square inside The Octagon by drawing a line from alternate corners of The Octagon, the sides of that square [1,054ft] are equal to the diameter of the circle that it's attached to [1,054ft].\"\nExamples of this interplay between earthworks have been found repeatedly by archaeologists. According to Lepper, that measure of 1054ft, whether halved or doubled, is found in other Indigenous earthworks across the country, and served as a common unit of measure.\u00a0\nWhile the Hopewell Culture's geometrical and mathematical knowledge astonished scholars, another level of sophistication appears when the layers are peeled back further: astronomical alignment.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The US's lost, ancient megacity\n\u2022 A mysterious US desert civilisation\n\u2022 A long-lost Maya city that was just discovered\nIn the 1980s, two professors at Earlham College in Indiana, Ray Hively (a physicist and astronomer) and Robert Horn (a philosopher), decided to pay a visit to The Octagon and its attached Observatory Circle. As astronomical monuments like Stonehenge had received great attention, they wondered if these earthworks were also aligned to a solar calendar.\u00a0\u00a0\nHively and Horn found no solar connections, but they then considered an alternative purpose: the lunar cycle.\n\"We thought deliberate lunar alignments unlikely at Newark,\" they wrote, because while the Sun can be tracked over a year, a complete lunar cycle takes 18.6 years. Even so, the lunar cycle proved to correspond to the position of the Observatory Mound at The Observatory Circle. There, one can watch the Moon rise over the exact centre of The Octagon in the distance every 18.6 years.\u00a0\n\"Astronomical alignments are only relevant and useful if they somehow tie the celestial orbs to belief systems and understandings of life,\" said Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University who has researched both Stonehenge and the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks. \"The ceremonies around the observation of the skyscape could well have a secondary function in terms of fostering community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThat ancient community and culture was part of the reason for its Unesco World Heritage Site inclusion.\u00a0\nA Unesco site needs to show that it has \"outstanding universal value\", said Jennifer Aultman, director of historic sites and museums at Ohio History Connection which helped lead its Unesco consideration. One criterion for this, she said, \"is that these are masterpieces of human creative genius\", which is where these mathematical, geometrical and astronomical features are important. The other, \"is that they bear really exceptional testimony to the cultural tradition that produced them\".\nAultman explained: \"You really can understand something about the lives of the people and what mattered to them by looking at, and learning about, the earthworks.\"\u00a0\nConsider the Moon, for example, which was clearly important for the Hopewell Culture. Darvill told me that, for some cultures, the \"Sun, Moon... are considered to have power over what happens on a day-to-day basis. As such, the heavenly bodies are often deified, which is how their power is justified and rationalised.\" It is therefore likely that the Moon was a deity shared by those who gathered at the mounds.\u00a0\n\"The land we know as Ohio is home to a number of extraordinary earthworks built by Indigenous residents of this region thousands of years ago,\" said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. While not all earthworks in Ohio are specifically Hopewell Mounds \u2013 such as the solar-aligned Serpent Mound Historical Site in Peebles, Ohio, for example \u2013 Wood sees them all as \"icons\" of Indigenous \"cultural achievements\".\u00a0\nSince the Hopewell Culture left no written records, only the earthworks and the few objects retrieved from them serve as their last cultural testimony. While archaeological excavations continue on some sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes and a small stone statue of a shaman wearing a bear skin and holding a human skull called \"the Shaman of Newark\" have been found. As these earthworks were gathering places and not villages, artefacts representing the locations from where these Indigenous peoples travelled have also been discovered, like effigy pipes, a copper head plate and an obsidian knife.\nHowever, after the Hopewell Culture gradually began to disappear starting around 500 CE, other Indigenous peoples stepped in to become caretakers of the land. One of those groups was the Shawnee Tribe, which called Ohio home before they were forcibly removed west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.\u00a0\n\"We may not have been responsible for building or creating them, but I know that my ancestors lived there, and that my ancestors protected them and respected them,\" said Chief Glenna Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, who believes that other tribes should have a role in the future of protecting the Hopewell Earthworks and communicating their cultural importance.\u00a0\nFor years, The Octagon was under the control of the Moundbuilders Country Club. After more than a decade of negotiations, the OHC and the club finally reached a deal in 2024 to transfer the site's long-term lease to the historical society, paving the way for them to open the earthworks to visitors beginning this January.\nFor advocates of the site's preservation, the Unesco designation and opening of these mysterious mounds to the public offers a new chapter to educate visitors about Ohio's Native American history. It also means more Indigenous stakeholders, like the Shawnee, can tell that story from an Indigenous perspective for future generations.\u00a0\n\"I just want people to know about it,\" said Chief Wallace, \"I want people to be able to see it. I want people to be able to visit it and want people to realise that it is a cultural phenomenon. That it's priceless.\"\u00a0\nThis story was originally published in December 2022 and has been updated to reflect recent developments.\n---\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n\u00a0",

        "article_text": "LeBron James, one of the most iconic figures in modern sports, has made history once again - this time in the toy aisle.\nMattel has announced the release of a new Barbie in Mr James' likeness, making him the first professional male athlete to be honoured as a Ken doll. \n\"We are excited to bring fans a new presentation of Ken,\" said Krista Berger, Mattel's senior vice president of Barbie. She said the doll celebrates \"LeBron as a role model,\" his ability as an icon to transcend culture and set a \"positive example for the next generation.\"\nThe doll features the Los Angeles Lakers basketball player in his pre-game fashion and reflects his height - it's an inch taller than the standard Ken doll. \nIn reality, the athlete is 6ft 9in tall.\nThe new doll comes as the company is facing financial uncertainty amid President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China, where just under 40% of Mattel's production is based.\nTrump announced on Wednesday that tariffs on goods from China would increase to 125%. He accused Beijing of a \"lack of respect\" after it retaliated and said it would impose tariffs of 84% on US imports.\nIn the same announcement, Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs and authorised a universal \"lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%\" as negotiations continued with roughly 60 countries. \nMattel has said it may have to increase prices and possibly implement changes to its supply chain. Consumer and business groups in the US have warned that the tariffs may disrupt supply chains and lead to higher prices.\nThe new Ken doll doesn't show the athlete in his basketball uniform. Instead, he's dressed in a varsity jacket adorned with \"LJ\" on the front. \nIt includes an Ohio patch and a crown patch on one sleeve and the number 23 - his basketball jersey number - on the other. On the back, \"LeBron\" is boldly printed along with the phrase, \"Just a kid from Akron\" - the Ohio city where he was born. \nUnder the jacket, the doll wears a shirt that reads \"We Are Family,\" a nod to the star's foundation. The doll includes accessories like a basketball, headphones and sneakers.\nIn a promotional video released by Mattel, Mr James reacted to see the doll for the first time. \"Oh, he dope!\" he says as he's given the figurine. \"That's so cool!\" \nAs he toyed with the doll's accessories, he joked the LeBron Ken doll \"might have to do a little lifting, legs are looking skinny\". \nThe move is a significant moment for the 65-year-old Barbie brand, which has made a push in recent years to diversify its dolls and reflect a broader range of careers, body types and backgrounds.\nThough Barbie has previously honoured athletes like Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and Megan Rapinoe, Mr James is the first male sports figure - and the first male figure not from the entertainment industry - to join the lineup.\nEven with four NBA titles, two Olympic gold medals, and a scoring record to his name, Mr James says his new title of \"Kenbassador\" hits differently\u2014because it's about more than basketball.\n\"It's an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness.\"",

        "article_text": "On 12 March, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was driving home with his young son in Maryland when he was stopped by agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nAgents took Mr Garcia into custody, then shuttled him to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas. \nAccording to a federal judge, after three days, \"without any notice, legal process, or hearing\", Mr Garcia found himself back in his native El Salvador at an infamous prison known for housing gang members. \nThe government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\".\nBut despite that, Mr Garcia remains incarcerated in El Salvador as lawyers debate the unusual intricacies of the case. \nA Maryland court ordered Mr Garcia be returned to the US,  but Trump officials argued that they cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr Garcia. The administration also argued that the judge ordering his return lacked the authority to do so.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on lower court orders while they consider the matter.\nImmigration experts say that as US President Donald Trump takes a hardline approach on illegal immigration, this case has the potential to upend due process  for immigrants.\n\"If the US Supreme Court were to accept [the Trump administration's] position, it would completely eviscerate any rule of law in the immigration process,\" Maureen Sweeney, director of the University of Maryland's Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, told the BBC.  \n\"Because they could pick up anybody, at any time, and send them anywhere with no repercussions whatsoever.\"\nUS District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in a filing Sunday that ICE officials did not follow procedures in the Immigration and Nationality Act when they deported Mr Garcia to El Salvador.\nShe ruled the US must bring him back before midnight on Monday. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, writing that the US \"has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street\".\nYet the Trump administration has argued that it cannot comply, saying Judge Xinis' filing is outside her jurisdiction.\n\"Neither a federal district court nor the United States has authority to tell the Government of El Salvador what to do,\" US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nNicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School said that while it is true - US district judges cannot order El Salvador to take action -  they can order the US government to have Mr Garcia returned.\nShe also said the US has previously facilitated the return of mistakenly deported individuals.\nProf Hallett also questioned the government's claim that the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr Garcia, citing an agreement between the two countries.\nThe US, under the Trump administration, paid El Salvador's government $6m to house prisoners it sends, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Top officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump himself have publicly touted the arrangement.\n\"It's almost as if the Salvadoran government is acting as an agent of the US government,\" Ms Hallett said, arguing that this makes the release more plausible.\nMr Garcia's lawyers argued that because El Salvador was detaining Mr Garcia \"at the direct request and pursuant to financial compensation\" from the US, the court could order the US government to request his return.\nMr Garcia is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison. Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation.\nMr Garcia, who is married to a US citizen, does not have any gang ties and has never been charged with a crime, his lawyer says.\nHe was also protected by a \"withholding of removal\" order, which means the US government cannot send him back to El Salvador because he could face harm. The order dates back to 2019, when ICE first took Mr Garcia into custody and alleged he belonged to the MS-13 criminal organisation, an allegation he denied at the time.\nSuch orders are common, immigration lawyers told the BBC, and are an alternative to asylum protections.\n\"It was an unlawful act, for the US to return him to the country where he could not be returned,\" said Amelia Wilson, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at Pace University.\nA judge ultimately granted Mr Garcia the 2019 order after he \"testified about how he was a victim of gang violence in El Salvador when he was a teenager and he came to the US to escape all of that,\" his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, wrote in a March 2025 affidavit.\nDepartment of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni acknowledged that at the time the \"government did not appeal that decision, so it is final\".\nThe Trump administration now reiterates allegations that Mr Garcia belonged to MS-13, but Judge Xinis said the government made this claim \"without any evidence\" and had not produced a removal order or warrant.\nThe Trump administration continues to press its case to the nation's highest court, setting up a potential showdown over the White House's deportation strategy.\nChief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay on Monday night, pausing lower court rulings while the US Supreme Court considers the government's appeal.\nPresident Trump touted the stay as a victory, writing on Truth Social that the ruling allowed the president \"to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself.\"\nImmigration lawyers, meanwhile, are watching Mr Garcia's case closely, considering it a test for how much power the administration can exert over US immigration.\n\"If the Trump administration is trying to remove these individuals by bypassing the immigration courts,\" said Ms Wilson, \"there's a direct and obvious line between what they're doing, and an effort by the administration to completely usurp judicial and due process.\"",

Now all three are buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed discotheque, after the roof caved in part way through the performance, leaving at least 218 dead.\n\"I haven't heard any news about any of them,\" said Shailyn Pe\u00f1a, M\u00e1ximo's 17-year-old daughter as she sat on a wall outside the devastated venue.\n\"It was just another Monday night for them. In fact, my dad invited my mum to come too but at the last minute she decided not to go. It was a blessing in disguise.\"\nBehind her as she spoke to me on Wednesday afternoon, a team of rescue workers was meticulously going through the rubble inside the building, listening for the slightest sound of a survivor beneath them. \nThey had been joined by Israeli and Mexican search teams and were using sophisticated heat-seeking equipment to try to locate anyone still alive. \nShailyn told me her cousin was one of the rescue workers, sifting through the debris for her own uncle, which she said brought her peace of mind that a relative was inside doing everything in her power to try to track M\u00e1ximo down.\nBut the uncertainty and the endless wait for information were becoming unbearable, Shailyn said.\n\"I feel the urge to just go in there and push aside all the rocks and pull him out. But as much as I want to, I really can't. I just have to sit here and wait it out.\"\nHours later, the government released a statement saying that \"all reasonable chances of finding more survivors have been exhausted\" and so the search and rescue mission would give way to the recovery of bodies. \nThe authorities have been doing what they can to keep the public informed, delivering grim updates on the number of dead, which has risen steadily with every passing hour. \nAt regular intervals, teams have been emerging from the site carrying bodies covered by blankets on stretchers.\nEarlier on, some people were brought out alive, bolstering the hopes of the relatives. \nThe head of the Emergency Operations Center (COE) said that since the roof collapse, 189 people had been \"rescued alive\".\nBut by Wednesday evening, officials said that given the conditions at the site observed by the more than 300 rescue workers, they would conclude the rescue phase of their operations \"within hours\". \nThe president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader, has declared three days of national mourning, a reflection of the scale of the tragedy unfolding at the site. \nAmong those confirmed to have lost their lives in the accident were some well-known national figures including P\u00e9rez himself, two much-loved former baseball players, Octavio Dotel and Tony Blanco, and a regional governor. And alongside them, scores of merengue music-lovers and P\u00e9rez fans also died in the collapse.\nFor now, the authorities' focus remains on the recovery operation. However, eventually the questions will turn to the cause of the collapse and government investigators will have to provide meaningful answers to the families in due course.\nOne theory is already circulating outside the venue. Many are pointing the finger of blame at a fire at the nightclub around two years ago. Some fear the blaze structurally weakened the site or that any repairs carried out were insufficient or not up to code.\nThe owner of the Jet Set nightclub, Antonio Espaillat, delivered a video message via social media expressing his condolences and those of \"all the Jet Set family\", to the victims' relatives.\nHe also insisted that he and his team were co-operating \"totally and transparently with the authorities\" over the disaster.\nShailyn Pe\u00f1a has heard about the fire at the nightclub and is among those who thinks it played a part. However, for now she has bigger worries. Despite the family's efforts to protect them, her younger stepsisters found out that their father and mother were trapped under the rubble from other children at school.\nThey are \"terrified\", she added.\nIt is Shailyn's birthday on Thursday, a day she would normally celebrate alongside her father, stepmother and aunt.\nInstead, she must endure it in the worst possible circumstances, caught inside the worst such tragedy in her country's modern history.",

He hasn't noticed it, but the people closest to him have.\nPimblett's team-mate Molly McCann, who retired last month, his coach Paul Rimmer, his wife Laura and his parents have all observed the change.\nThey noticed it after the birth of Pimblett's identical twin daughters, Betsy and Margot, one year ago.\n\"It's given me more motivation. I'm training harder than I've ever trained now because they're in the back of my mind,\" Pimblett tells BBC Sport. \n\"I need to look after them for the rest of my life, I need to put food on the table so yeah, it's changed me.\n\"All the people closest to me have said it and to be honest, I know they're not gonna lie.\"\nLiverpool's Pimblett has been training for the next big test of his career when he faces American lightweight Michael Chandler at UFC 314 in Miami, Florida on Saturday.\nMurphy outclasses Emmett to stay unbeaten in UFC\nUFC win was 15 years in the making - McKee\nPimblett says he has been in the gym almost \"every day\" since his statement first-round submission win over Bobby Green in July,  preparing for Chandler, but has also had more time to adjust to parenthood.\nBecause Pimblett's daughters are identical, the 30-year-old would sometimes get them mixed up, so he's figured out a way to tell them apart.\n\"There's only little things that help me tell the difference but one of the big things is Margot has a bangle on her left hand and Betty has a bangle on her right hand,\" he adds.\nPimblett responds with trademark humour when he is asked what he has learned since becoming a dad.\n\"Try and just have one baby, twins are hard work,\" jokes Pimblett.\n\"One of us can't just put them to bed, both of us have to be there. If one cries in the car they will wake the other one up. So yeah, it's a lot harder.\"\nPimblett is 12th in the UFC lightweight rankings following his win over Green nine months ago, while Chandler is five places above him in seventh.\nThe 38-year-old is a former three-time Bellator lightweight champion and UFC title challenger, losing to Charles Oliveira in 2021.\nSince joining the UFC in 2021 - although he has lost four of his six bouts - Chandler has developed into one of the most popular fighters on the roster because of his gung-ho fighting style and willingness to trade punches with opponents.\nWith Pimblett no stranger to fanfare, the stage is set for one of the most highly-anticipated bouts of the year.\n\"Obviously everyone in the MMA world knew who Bobby Green and Tony Ferguson were, but Michael Chandler - most of the world know who he is, never mind people who just watch MMA,\" said Pimblett.\n\"He's gonna come out and try and take my head off, I know he is 100%, and I'll be using my range against him.\n\"He's confident as well as I am, and I'm looking forward to putting on a show for everyone.\"\nPimblett has won all six fights since his UFC debut in 2021 and believes he is not too far away from a lightweight title shot.\nRussia's Islam Makhachev holds the championship at the moment, with his win against Renato Moicano in July breaking the UFC record for most defences of the belt with four.\n\"A win will put me up to rank seven, that's the main thing. Beat Michael, then fight someone in the top five, then I'll be fighting for the title next year,\" said Pimblett.\n\"All my fans [believe in me].

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.\nExperts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.\nPassengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.\nThe digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.\nLying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.\nThis would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.\nAll died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.\n\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"\nA new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.\nIt takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.\n\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.\nThe simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.\nTitanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. \nBut the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.\n\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.\n\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"\nUnfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.\nThe human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.\nPersonal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.\nThe scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.\n\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\"",

        "article_text": "Hannah Hampton has kept six clean sheets in 13 England caps\nHannah Hampton appears to be in pole position to take the number one spot for England at the 2025 Women's Euros, with head coach Sarina Wiegman saying she is \"a little bit ahead\" of counterpart Mary Earps.\nEarps has been a mainstay of England's success in recent years, helping the Lionesses win Euro 2022 and reach the final of the 2023 Women's World Cup.\nHowever, she has faced increasing competition from Hampton since the beginning of 2024 and the Chelsea keeper has been preferred for each of England's past three Women's Nations League matches.\nUp until now, Wiegman had been reluctant to confirm who would be her first choice, but that changed in the build-up to kick-off of England's defeat in Belgium.\nSpeaking to ITV, she said: \"I have two world-class goalkeepers. At the moment, [Hannah] is a little bit ahead.\"\nEarps (right) was England's number one when they won Euro 2022\nYou only have to look at Earps' individual accolades to appreciate her quality as a goalkeeper. A two-time Fifa women's goalkeeper of the year, the golden glove winner at the 2023 World Cup, BBC Sports Personality of the Year - the list is endless.\nShe had to fight hard for the gloves on the international stage, making her debut against Switzerland in June 2017 but only earning a further seven caps over the next three years in the face of competition from Karen Bardsley, Carly Telford and fellow youngster Ellie Roebuck.\nWiegman's arrival in 2021 proved a turning point, with Earps starting each of her first seven games in charge and going on to be ever present during Euro 2022, the 2023 World Cup - including a memorable penalty save to deny Jenni Hermoso in the final, and the 2023 Women's Nations League.\nHowever, since the beginning of 2024, Wiegman has favoured rotating her goalkeepers, selecting Hampton in six of England's past 10 matches.\nThe pair traded places in friendlies against Austria, Italy, Germany and South Africa last year. Earps won the gloves for November's much-anticipated meeting with the USA, keeping a clean sheet in the process, but was replaced by Hampton against Switzerland three days later. \nCrucially, the Chelsea keeper, who has six clean sheets in 13 caps, has been selected in three of England's four Women's Nations League matches, including the win over world champions Spain.\nEarps is, by far, the more experienced goalkeeper, earning 53 caps for England and keeping 26 clean sheets. And she's been in good form since swapping Manchester United for Paris St-Germain last summer, conceding just 12 goals in 17 league outings.\nHowever, Hampton is also enjoying an impressive campaign. Establishing herself as Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper this season, she has conceded 13 goals in 18 WSL matches - a record bettered by only Manchester United's Phallon Tullis-Joyce - and featured in their past three Women's Champions League outings.\nAnd with Hampton, who previously played for Birmingham City and Aston Villa, eight years younger than 32-year-old Earps, is this a sign that Wiegman and England are looking to the future?\nHampton and Earps are battling to be England's first-choice goalkeeper\nFormer England striker Ian Wright backed Wiegman's decision to favour Hampton.\n\"[She will improve] the more experience she can get in games and work on her concentration because in respect of everything else, her distribution, I think she's a better goalkeeper,\" he said on ITV.\nHowever, he also praised Earps' character, adding: \"Mary's got main character energy. If she gets a sniff back in that goal, it's going to be tough for Hannah, it'll be tough to get her out. Imagine having Mary Earps as your back-up [at the Euros].\"\nFormer England midfielder Karen Carney says Wiegman's backing for Hampton could help both keepers in making the situation clearer.\nAlso speaking on ITV, she said: \"You often hear goalkeepers say there has to be a clear number one and maybe Sarina Wiegman's helping Hannah prepare for that.\n\"And also showing Mary Earps that Hannah's in ahead of you, and this is going to happen at the tournament, and preparing her for that.\"\nHowever, ex-England striker Ellen White, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly podcast, said it could prove a \"a big challenge\" for her former team-mate Earps to adjust to being the back-up keeper.\n\"Mary had been absolutely phenomenal. Her experience on the international stage, tournament after tournament, so it's going to be challenging for her if she is number two.\"\nHead here to get involved",

        "article_text": "It's only been a couple of years since the last series of Charlie Brooker's dystopian Netflix show Black Mirror landed. But we're now living in an unpredictable world and a lot can happen in a short space of time.\nRenowned for its often savvy and disturbing takes on humanity and our relationship with technology, Black Mirror is back for a seventh series at a time when the pace of change in both politics and tech has left many of us - including lawmakers - struggling to keep up.\nIn 2011, when the first episode aired, Siri was the new kid on the block and the iPhone 4S had just been launched. Now we have Meta AI embedded in WhatsApp and we're on series 10 of the Apple watch. \nSince then, Black Mirror has taken us from creepy memory devices, phone implants and robotic bees to actors-turned-werewolves. And everything in between.\nBrooker is in buoyant mood as, he tells the BBC there appears to be little danger of him running out of ideas anytime soon, when asked if Black Mirror could go on forever.\n\"Hopefully [it will run and run]. Selfishly, it's a fun job,\" he says. \"Technology is developing in the real world very quickly. \n\"That means there are more sources of inspiration, and... the viewer is experiencing more [technological] things in their everyday life.\n\"We can do stories that I wouldn't have thought of 10 years ago, and also, you don't need to explain some of the concepts to people because they've got it in their phone.\"\nThe Crown and Deadpool & Wolverine actor Emma Corrin, who stars in one of this season's episodes, adds: \"It's much closer to home. People have access to stuff like AI which is terrifying so then it's more confronting and serves as a better warning.\"\nBrooker jokes: \"So you're saying it should go on forever?\" \n\"Yes, it should go on forever,\" Corrin concurs.\nBrooker adds: \"I'll find out when it stops if I drop dead or people stop watching.\"\nCorrin appears in an episode titled Hotel Reverie, alongside Issa Rae. The pair both play A-listers appearing in a remake of a vintage Hollywood classic. With a twist, of course.\nCorrin plays screen siren Dorothy Chambers, and reflects: \"I really enjoyed playing in a 1940s movie star.\n\"I just like the voice and the mannerisms and the way they hold themselves, and the style of acting is so ridiculous, larger than life and tongue in cheek, and yet packed with emotion at the same time.\"\nWithout giving too much away, AI - the subject of much debate in the creative industries - rears its head in the storyline.\nCorrin says they don't \"feel great\" about its potential impact on their profession.\n\"Obviously, I think it's scary, but it's also a massive conversation, right? There are aspects of it that are terrifying to me as an artist. I love the creative process. I love that this art is born out of being in a room with people and things coming from the depths of someone's human experience or imagination. And I really don't think we'll lose that, or I hope not. \n\"And I think there are also aspects of AI I probably don't understand, and that could be used as tools for good. It's about everyone being able to understand them and to use them correctly, and them being in the right hands.\"\nBrooker agrees: \"Quite rightly, when Andy Serkis played Gollum [in the Lord of the Rings trilogy], everyone's amazed by that, but what you're amazed by is the human, you're seeing a human performance shining through.\n\"I can totally see the value of AI as a tool for creative people. The point at which it worries me is if you remove the people bit from that equation, or you're just hoovering up their work and regurgitating it, and they're not being paid.\"\nBrooker also returns to another favourite tech theme, which he's used as a jumping off point for several Black Mirror episodes over the previous six series. The world of gaming.\nRemember the interactive standalone Black Mirror film Bandersnatch, where Asim Chaudhry and Will Poulter played a games company boss and a genius developer? The pair are now reprising their roles from the 2018 movie in a new series seven episode called Plaything.\nScottish actor Lewis Gribben, who is soon to star in the highly anticipated TV series Blade Runner 2099, plays 1990s games journalist and loner Cameron, who becomes obsessed with one particular game featuring little pixel creatures. (Brooker himself was a games journalist back in the day). \nFormer Doctor Who Peter Capaldi also turns in a brilliantly disturbing performance as an older Cameron.\nAlthough a big Black Mirror fan, Gribben hadn't seen Bandersnatch but says that coming to Plaything fresh actually aided his performance.\n\"I think it made it easier for me... but I was just intimidated. I was like 'Oh my god, it's Will Poulter who I've watched since I was seven years old acting in Son of Rambow. And Asim Chowdhury from People Just Do Nothing!\"\nGribben tells the BBC he's a bit of a gamer himself but has more of a handle on it than his Black Mirror character. \n\"I'm playing the new Assassin's Creed Shadows at the minute,\" he says. \"When you have a day off... I can spend a solid 10 hours [on it]. But I like to think most people game in moderation or just have bingeing game sessions. It's more like a relaxation thing.\"\nJosh Finan, who has starred in Baby Reindeer, The Responder and recently played Gerry Adams in Say Nothing, plays an acquaintance of Cameron who becomes unwittingly embroiled in his companion's distorted sense of reality. \nThe pair will both star in the highly anticipated Amazon mini-series, Blade Runner 2099. Expected to drop later this year, the action takes place 50 years after 2017's Blade Runner 2049, a movie that also analyses the relationship between humans and AI.\nFinan isn't too worried about being replaced by robots though.\n\"I'm very optimistic. I don't think actors are going anywhere. Maybe I'm being naive [but] I don't think there's any danger of being replaced. What we do is too special.\"\nBlack Mirror series seven can be seen on Netflix from Thursday 10 April.",

We are more than capable to score two or three goals at home.\"\nVilla's goalscorer Morgan Rogers - who gave them the lead at the Parc des Princes - told TNT Sports: \"There's loads of belief in the changing room.\n\"We have nothing to lose, nobody thought we'd win the tie in the first place. Why not just go for it?\"\nMendes' late strike puts PSG in control against Villa\nWilliam takes eldest son George to watch Villa in Paris\nThis video can not be played\nRogers rounds off team move to give Villa shock lead at PSG\nSo, what chance do Villa have of hauling themselves back into this tie and even winning it?\nIt should be noted that similar comebacks have been achieved before.\nNine teams have been exactly two goals down after an away leg in a knockout Champions League tie and managed to successfully turn things around at home.\nThe most recent to do that were Juventus, who lost 2-0 at Atletico Madrid in the 2018-19 last-16 stage but won their second leg 3-0.\nParis St-Germain have twice surrendered two-goal leads at the halfway stage of a Champions League knockout tie to be eliminated - the most of any club.

        "article_text": "As a former champion runner, Richard McDonald can move quickly. \nBut the speed of the market falls, triggered by the sweeping global tariffs Donald Trump announced last week, still kept him on his toes.\nPreviously a trader for Credit Suisse, he now buys and sells stocks privately. At his laptop in London last week, he watched as the president unveiled a poster board outlining tariff rates, some as high as 50%, for imports from countries around the world.\nHe raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold. \n\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first',\" he said. \"My mind was sprinting.\"\nIn 25 years of trading, he said he had rarely experienced anything like it.\nTrillions were wiped off the value of financial markets around the world in the aftermath of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement. \nLeading share indexes in the US and UK saw some of the steepest declines since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, dropping more than 10% over three days. \nOil prices sank and so did the dollar. \nBy Wednesday, the worries had spread to the bond market, as investors started dumping US government debt, usually a safe haven for investors in times of uncertainty.\nWhen Trump announced he was putting some of the most eye-watering tariffs on pause, shares stopped sliding and rallied. \nBut the market turmoil was far from over. \nTrump left in place a tariff of 10% on imports from most countries and a tariff of 145% on goods from China, America's third largest source of imports after the European Union and Mexico.\nA day after the announcement, the S&P 500 dropped another 3.5%, the Dow slid 2.5% and the Nasdaq fell 4.3%.\nAt St Louis-based Argent Capital Management, the mood, said portfolio manager Jed Ellerbroek, was \"still miserable\".\nSome of his firm's holdings, like health insurance giant United Healthcare, have done well over the last week, as investors look for companies likely to be able to weather the tariff storm.\nBut his third largest investment is Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones and other products in China.\n\"Trump has induced a gigantic amount of uncertainty into the global economy and consumers and investors and business managers are reeling and unable to make long-term decisions,\" Mr Ellerboek said. \n\"We are really on hold, because we only trade when we have high conviction levels,\" he said.\n\"What do we do with Apple? I don't know. I'm not going to change when I have no clue what the tariff rate is going to be next week,\" he said. \nFaced with so many uncertainties, some investors are simply quitting the market, said John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics.\n\"What you're looking at, broadly speaking, is a market that is frustrated, uncertain and confused about where we're going to be one day to the next,\" he said.  \"In that environment you have a tendency to see some investors choosing the safety of cash.\"\nWhile Trump's tariff rollback was a \"relief\", he said it did not change the bigger picture: firms in the US that are bringing in parts or products are facing significantly higher import taxes than they were at the start of the year. \n\"The tariffs that remain are still high enough that they are likely to push up inflation and weigh significantly on the economy as we go forward,\" he said.\n\"We're just back trading again on the broader long-term outlook of the tariff implications, which is still negative.\"",

And he ranks second in Ligue 1 for completed dribbles with 74, behind Paris St-Germain's Desire Doue with 79.\nThere are also training videos of Cherki with France Under-21s, where he displays equal ability to control and volley a ball with both feet. \n\"He is two-footed, has no fear, keeps going and going, can get past people with such ease, such finesse,\" says Maitland-Niles.\n\"He is now working for the team off the ball and has gone to another level this season.\"\nIn an in-depth interview with BBC Sport, Maitland-Niles also talks about why Arsenal are too reliant on Saka, success under Jose Mourinho at Roma, moving to France and why Lyon will show Manchester United \"respect\". \nMaitland-Niles has been a near ever-present for Lyon and played 34 matches in all competitions this season\nAfter becoming the second youngest Arsenal player to appear in the Champions League, Maitland-Niles thought he would be at his boyhood club his entire life. \nThe defender had been in the Arsenal academy since the age of six and grew up supporting the club but opted to leave on a free transfer to Lyon in 2023. \n\"Life has obviously taken a different turn,\" he says. \"I thought I'd have been in the Premier League my whole career and things obviously didn't go to plan with Arsenal.\n\"But I'm thankful to the club and they didn't put any blockages when it came to leaving. I left as, like most footballers, I wanted to play.\"\nBut why not join another Premier League club? \nHe says: \"I told my agent not to tell me which clubs were interested but just the ones with firm offers. \n\"Lyon were the first to come in and it was such a big club showing their trust and belief in me. It was hard to turn down and it was a good time to try something different. I was at a point where I needed to be shown a lot of love and thought it was a good fit for me. \n\"Of course, I am happy with where I am at this point in time. But who is to say what might come up? In the meantime, I am very happy here and enjoying every moment.\n\"I am still that same player as I was at Arsenal but now with a stronger mindset and more consistency and I know what it takes to succeed.\"\nMaitland-Niles won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2020\nA debut under legendary manager Arsene Wenger, a Europa League final start under Unai Emery in 2019, winning the FA Cup with Mikel Arteta in 2020 and winning five England caps all rank among the major landmarks in Maitland-Niles' journey.\n\"I'm still an Arsenal fan, I watch most of our games and I lived a boyhood dream by winning an FA Cup final at Wembley for the club. [That] was the pinnacle. I supported Arsenal since I was six. I wish them well,\" he adds. \nBut the FA Cup under Arteta, who he regards as a \"tactical genius in Pep Guardiola's mould\", is the last trophy Arsenal have won. \n\"[Arteta] really studied how Pep took football to new heights as one of the best managers in the world,\" he says. \"He really studied how to break down teams and be most effective in games.\n\"Arsenal are showing that at this point, not coming close enough to win the league but you can see they are making big improvements by going close two years in a row.\"\nOn his relationship with Arteta, the defender adds: \"I wouldn't say there was anything special there. I had respect for him as a manager, I thought he was a tactical genius but it was an average player-manager relationship, not especially close.\"\nMaitland-Niles also admits it is \"frustrating\" the club has not followed up that FA Cup success but gives his backing to Arteta, while adding star attacker Saka needs support.\n\"I think they now rely on him a bit too much and you can't expect so much from such a young player,\" he says.\n\"He hasn't even hit his prime yet. But I think he is the driving force of the team and they miss a bit of attacking threat when he is not playing.\n\"Bukayo has become one of the world's best wingers, very consistent, knows how to kill off a game and he can pick his moment in a genius way.\"\nAttacker Ethan Nwaneri, 18, is having his breakthrough this season and could be one option to help Saka.\n\"Physically, he is absolutely incredible and there is no fear in the kid,\" continues Maitland-Niles.  \n\"He is just going at people and trying to make things happen. You can see he is trying to become a leader very early in that team. He is trying to cement his place which is difficult as he plays in the same positions as [Martin] Odegaard and Saka. \n\"But he has got the ability to do so as well. He has the world at his feet and he just needs to take his chance.\"\nAnother landmark for Maitland-Niles was winning the Conference League under Mourinho during a successful six-month loan stint at Roma.\n\"He is a really funny guy,\" says Maitland-Niles. \"The stories Jose gave us about his previous dressing rooms and how he has won cup finals and loads of different leagues - that is an experience you can take something from.\n\"There are a lot of players that would say they love him or hate him. But he is a great guy and what you see is what you get.\"\nMaitland-Niles achieved European success in the Conference League for Jose Mourinho's Roma in 2022\nMaitland-Niles, who is becoming one of the leaders at Lyon, has warned Thursday's Europa League opponents Manchester United that \"people don't realise how big Lyon are\".\n\"We are a historically big club,\" he adds. \"Considering where we were last season, it has been a great year but we need to be addicted to winning, push for more and aim for the Champions League.\"\nMaitland-Niles also says Lyon will try to show Ruben Amorim's United side \"respect but just not too much respect\".\nHe adds: \"They are not having the greatest season but have players like Bruno (Fernandes) and (Christian) Eriksen can run over you if you show too much respect. \n\"We have a great team, great manager and team spirit. We will not be scared, we'll give it our all and believe we can win.\"\nOf course, returning to England for the second leg will also prove exciting.\nHe says: \"As an Englishman, it will be nice to go home. Old Trafford is nothing short of what they call it, the Theatre of Dreams - it can be a dream for you but it can crush your dreams, too.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is a man in a hurry. \nIn the few short months he has been in office, the US president has sought and failed to bring peace to Gaza and Ukraine. He has bombed Yemen. He has launched a global trade war. Now he is turning his attention to Iran.\nThis has always been on the president's jobs list. For Trump, Iran is unfinished business from his first term. \nThe issue remains the same as it was then: what can stop Iran seeking a nuclear weapon? \nIran denies it has any such ambition. But other countries believe the Islamic republic wants at the very least the capacity to build a nuclear warhead, a desire that some fear could spark an arms race or even all-out war in the Middle East.\nIn 2015, Iran agreed a deal with the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. It was called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). \nUnder its provisions, Iran would limit its nuclear ambitions - and allow in international inspectors - in return for getting economic sanctions lifted.\nBut Trump pulled the US out of the deal in 2018, claiming it rewarded terrorism by funding Iran's proxy militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The US reimposed sanctions. \nIran subsequently ignored some of the deal's restrictions and enriched more and more uranium nuclear fuel. \nAnalysts fear Iran could soon have enough weapons-grade uranium to make a nuclear warhead. \nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) watchdog estimates Iran's stockpile of 60% enriched uranium could make about six bombs if it was enriched to the next and final level.\nWithin days of his inauguration, Trump restored his former policy of so-called \"maximum pressure\" on Iran. \nOn 4 February, with his trademark fat felt-tip pen, he signed a memorandum ordering the US Treasury to impose further sanctions on Iran and punish countries violating existing sanctions, especially those buying Iranian oil.\nNow the White House is hoping to match that economic pressure with diplomacy. \nLast month, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. \nThe president offered to begin negotiations and sought a deal within a couple of months.\nNow he has agreed to direct discussions between US and Iranian officials in Oman at the weekend.\nThe US threat to Iran is explicit: agree a deal or face military action. \n\"If the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,\" Trump said on Monday.\nSo how might Iran respond? \nSome policymakers in Tehran appear keen to agree a deal that could get sanctions lifted. \nIran's economy is in dire straits, with soaring inflation and a plunging currency. \nBut any such deal might involve compromises some hardliners could find hard to stomach. \nIran has suffered huge reverses in recent months, seeing its proxy militias severely weakened by war with Israel and its regional ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, ousted. Some in Tehran argue now may be exactly the time to build a nuclear deterrent.\nBoth the US and Iran seem far apart. Their negotiating positions are not explicit. \nBut the US has made clear it wants the full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear programme, including a complete end to any further uranium enrichment, plus no further support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\nThat might prove too much for Iran to accept. \nA complete ban on any nuclear enrichment - even for civilian purposes - has long been seen as an absolute red line for Tehran. \nThere is also the problem of Iranian technological expertise: its scientists simply know more now about how to make a nuclear weapon than they did 10 years ago.\nAs for Israel, it has made clear it would accept only the complete end to any Iranian nuclear capability. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he would agree to \"the way it was done in Libya\". \nThis is a reference to the decision by late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to dismantle his entire nuclear programme in 2003 in return for getting sanctions lifted. \nBut Iran is unlikely to follow this precedent.\nWhat if talks fail? \nIsrael has long considered military options to try to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities. But many are buried deep in underground bunkers. \nMilitary analysts say Israel would need not just US help to bomb Iran, it might also need special forces on the ground to guarantee the destruction of its nuclear facilities. \nThis means military action would be risky and its success by no means guaranteed.\nTrump also came to office promising not to start any more so-called \"forever wars\", and an all-out regional conflict involving Iran could become one of those. \nThat has not stopped the US president from reportedly giving Israel more air defences and deploying more long-range B2 bombers to the region.\nSo, for now, Trump seems to be looking for a diplomatic solution - one Israel might have to accept as a fait accompli, regardless of its provisions. \nBut if there is no agreement, he is reserving the right to use force, the consequences of which could be devastating.\nIn the meantime, the president is allowing two months for both sides to agree a deal. \nHe may have forgotten it took negotiators two years to agree the JCPOA. Rushed diplomacy is not always successful diplomacy.",

        "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.\nBut now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.\nThe White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \n\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.\nThat framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. \nSo was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?\nIt didn't take long for Trump's aides \u2013 many of the same people who said he would never back down \u2013 to fan out and celebrate the president's move.\nTrade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\".\n\"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\"\nThey were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?\nUltimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.\nEarlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. \nIn the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.\nHe insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".\n\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.\nIn the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. \nThe reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. \nIt is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.\nThat will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions.\nThe big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week \u2013 setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order \u2013 will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. \nAnd in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "President Trump has been justifying his sweeping tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\".\nHe has imposed tariffs - or import taxes - on countries around the world, including a 125% rate on goods imported from China. In response, China is hiking its tariffs on American imports. \nSome of Trump's claims on trade are unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\n\"We're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\", Trump has said about his new tariff regime on Tuesday. \nBBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 7 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $215m (\u00a3168m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based it on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs (as of 2 April) is 22%. \nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level. \nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April. \nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day. \nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. \nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported. \nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. \nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\". \n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said. \nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false. \nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false. \nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA.  \nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"\nIn a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.\nEmber is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling. \nBut this hasn't happened yet due to increasing global demand for electricity. \nCheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.\nChina continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.\nThough it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India. \nWind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.\nThe report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.\nThe big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy. \nThat means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.\nAccording to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024. \nThis was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.\nIn the last five years, fast-growing Asian economies, in particular India and China, have continued expanding their use of fossil fuels to meet rapidly rising demand for electricity.

Ireland's back three is unchanged with Anna McGann named at wing after scoring a hat-trick of tries in Parma.Ireland suffered a record 88-10 Six Nations defeat by England in last year's championship but head coach Scott Bemand said earlier this week that his side are now a considerably \"better team\".Ireland: Flood; McGann, Dalton, Higgins, Costigan (capt); O'Brien, Lane; O'Dowd, Jones, Djougang; Tuite, Wall; Hogan, King, Wafer.Replacements: Moloney, McCarthy, Haney, Campbell, Moore, Reilly, Fowles, Elmes Kinlan.Related topicsIrish RugbyNorthern Ireland SportRugby Union",

        "article_text": "Business owners affected by flooding in 2023 have expressed their disappointment after less than half the money allocated to a support scheme was paid out.\nThere was heavy flooding in Newry and Downpatrick, in County Down, in autumn 2023.\nA multi-million pounds support scheme was set up to help affected businesses. Applications closed on 31 March.\nFigures released to BBC News NI highlight significant underspend. Only \u00a34.7m has been issued in letters of offer, out of a pot of \u00a310m.\nThe Department for the Economy announced in February 2024 that up to \u00a310m would be allocated to councils to deliver three flood schemes: an enhanced flood support scheme which provided up to \u00a3100k to flooded businesses and two hardship schemes.\n\"We could have done with a lot more (money) and I know other businesses who were refused any help or were only getting very small portions so I can't believe money is going back unused, it's unbelievable,\" Hugh Boyle told BBC News NI.\nMr Boyle runs a number of businesses in Newry, including The Q Club, a large snooker and gaming centre in the Basin Walk area of the city.\nHe said that the money \"wouldn't have covered a third of our devastation here\". \nMr Boyle said that it was a \"huge cost\" to get his business back up and running after the canal behind it flooded.\n\"There was total devastation inside,\" he said.\n\"Everything on the ground floor was completely destroyed - pool tables, snooker tables, machines, our cash desks, everything.\"\nHe said they were \"glad to hear that the council and government were going to help us, although it was a very difficult process to get that money\".\n\"We had to prove that the work was done, we had to pay for the work before we could get anything back, so that was very difficult,\" he added. \n\nThe scheme was administered by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.\nIn a statement, the council said that \"a total of \u00a34.7m has been issued in letters of offer with 80 applicants making claims paid to the value of \u00a33.8m to date\".\nThe council added that \u00a3162,500, in total, had been processed to 46 businesses as part of a hardship scheme.\nThe Department for Economy said that it anticipated that the final cost of the three schemes would be about \u00a35m and confirmed that \"any unspent money has been reallocated across the department to meet other capital pressures\".\nIn recent months, many businesses in Newry and Downpatrick have spoken to BBC News NI in relation to perceived difficulties in drawing down the financial support. \nOthers have said they do not wish to go on record until their support claims have been fully processed.\nOne business owner described having to borrow money from friends in order to buy replacement fittings before being able to reclaim this through the scheme which was \"extremely difficult and long winded\".\nLoretta Gallagher owns Lorsha Design which is situated above a caf\u00e9, alongside the canal.\nShe was initially given a \u00a37,500 support payment but was later deemed ineligible.\n\"The ground floor was decimated and the whole building was affected by everything that comes with five feet of Newry canal coming into the building,\" she said.\n\"There was damp coming up the walls, vermin, mildew, everything. The only access to my shop was through the flooded caf\u00e9 so nobody could come in.\n\"Our floor didn't flood but lots of my stock and silks were destroyed. I couldn't properly open until May (2024).\"\nEamonn Connolly is head of the Newry Business Improvement District.\nHe told BBC News NI that many business owners had difficulties with the scheme.\n\"There are people impacted by the floods who still haven't got any compensation and we would be loathed to see an underspend not being allocated to those that need it,\" he said.\n\"In one regard, it's not a shock because we know the purse strings have been held tight and I understand why.\n\"But the extent of the losses far outweighs the funding.\"\nThe Department for Infrastructure said it spent all of the additional \u00a310.5m it was allocated for works following the floods.\n\"The capital funding of \u00a38.6m was spread across the department, NI Water and Translink,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"This included repair and remediation work, such as dealing with landslides, repairing storm damage to roads and footways and replacing damaged equipment.\n\"Other capital expenses included purchasing additional plants and equipment, repairing structural damage to railway embankments and lineside drainage replacement for Translink.\"\nA Department for Infrastructure report outlining potential measures to protect town centres from future flooding is due to be published before the end of next month.",

Harriet Dart and Olivia Nicholls are also involved, with Jodie Burrage added when Raducanu withdrew last week.\n\"Obviously it's disappointing we don't have her on this team, but I totally understand what she needs to do,\u201d Keothavong said of Raducanu.\n\"A player has got to do what a player has got to do - what is best for them. \n\"She has given a lot to this team and she may not be with us this time round but I hope in the future she will be.\"\nBoulter, who suffered a stress fracture of the back on national team duty in 2019,  also emphasised the importance of managing your workload.\n\"I made that mistake once when I went out and played and got injured, so I've always said number one thing is your body,\" British number one Boulter said.\n\"You have to look after it, or else unfortunately you're not going to be playing week in week out, and that's the most important thing for me.\n\"Representing your country is an honour and a privilege and I do my very best with my body to be here every time.\n\"I think that's all we can ask of any person.\"\nBoulter will lead the British team on the clay - a surface on which she has relatively little experience.\nBoulter had not played a tour-level match on clay before the Madrid Open last April.\nKartal is likely to make her debut by taking the second singles role. She will be buoyed by her run to the last sixteen in Indian Wells last month and playing on a surface which \"enhances my game style even more\".\nGB reached the semi-finals last year, losing to eventual runners-up Slovakia.",

        "article_text": "It's having a moment with celebrities, fashionistas and Gen Z. But wearing any kind of fur, from vintage to synthetic, poses some difficult questions. Could a new plant-based faux fur be the way forward?\nFrom Tory Burch in New York and Simone Rocha in London, to Fendi in Milan and Miu Miu in Paris, fur dominated the autumn/winter 2025-26 catwalks. And celebrities matched the runways, with Hailey Bieber, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift and Rihanna all spending the start of the year wrapped up in faux and vintage fur coats.\nThe last time fur hit the headlines was in 2017, when Gucci pledged to go fur-free, influencing a host of designer brands to follow suit. The move was welcomed by animal rights campaigners, but what followed was the scaling of a new problem: much of the real fur has been replaced by synthetic alternatives that are derived from fossil fuels. Given the tensions around animal welfare and the environment, why is fur now firmly back in fashion?\nIt began in early 2024 with the arrival of the mob wife aesthetic, an ostentatious, glamorous response to the understated, minimalist trend that preceded it: stealth wealth. \"Reviving historical looks for contemporary wear is a natural part of the fashion cycle. It's escapism, and who doesn't want some of that?\" says Natascha Radclyffe-Thomas, associate professor, MBA fashion business and entrepreneurship, at Ravensbourne University, London. \"I was in the room when [former CEO] Marco Bizzarri announced Gucci would no longer use animal fur in its collections, and remember what an amazing shift this was for an Italian luxury brand where fur was such a prevalent material. But the topic of faux fur is such a tricky one, too.\"\nRadclyffe-Thomas adds that, since designer labels' decision to ban real fur from their collections, the faux-fur market has evolved from the early days of \"fun\" fur \u2013 low cost, often in bright colours that didn't attempt to imitate the real thing \u2013 to a new level of quality where most consumers wouldn't know the difference between real and fake.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe production of fossil fuel-based fabrics continues to rise globally, with polyester the most common, accounting for 57% of all fibre production. Even clothing made from recycled polyester is problematic because the model isn't circular. The vast majority is made using plastic bottles \u2013\u00a0 not old textiles \u2013 which means that it can't be recycled again, and will most likely end up in landfill at some point.\nOne way to keep faux fur out of landfill \u2013\u00a0 or delay its final destination \u2013 is to keep it in circulation. At fashion rental company By Rotation, the rental of faux fur and wool coats has been increasing since even before the recent catwalk shows. London label Charlotte Simone \u2013\u00a0 whose faux fur coats have been worn by Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa and Madonna \u2013 is the third most rented brand across coats and jackets. \"Higher quality, well-made faux fur, especially from designer brands, tends to last longer, meaning it's more likely to be passed down, resold or rented rather than discarded,\" By Rotation founder and CEO, Eshita Kabra-Davies, tells the BBC.\nThe global second hand clothing market is expected to reach $367bn by 2029, with a record number of shoppers having bought pre-loved clothes in 2024. This year, since the autumn/winter 2025-26 collections were shown, searches for both real and faux fur have spiked at rental platforms and online retailers.\u00a0\nHolly Watkins, owner of vintage boutique One Scoop Store in north London, says that in the past few years she has seen a considerable shift away from selling real fur to fake alternatives, in response to changing tastes and demands from her customers. \"I only sell real fur if it's a super-special vintage piece which I can't say no to, or has a detachable collar or trim,\" she tells the BBC. \"Personally, I don't have a problem with old [real] fur \u2013 it's better to prolong its life than send it to landfill. I have more of a problem with polyester, in that it will never biodegrade.\"\nBut from conversations with vintage dealers in west London\u00a0\u2013 home to the likes of Portobello market \u2013 Watkins says that many stores have never stopped selling real fur, both old and new, with younger shoppers helping to drive the trend.\u00a0\n\"Fashion turned on fur. Young customers want more\" was the headline of a recent Wall Street Journal article \u2013 and the consensus does seem to be that Gen Z is leading the revival of vintage fur. Madison Avenue Furs, the largest buyer of pre-owned fur in the US, reports a significant uplift in sales, particularly of pre-owned pieces. \"We saw college students coming in to buy fur, which we haven't seen in years,\" Larry Cowit, owner of Madison Avenue Furs, tells the BBC. \"The vintage furs against the new furs was a concern for many of the younger buyers and \u2013 ethically \u2013 they were comfortable with vintage.\"\nCustomers are buying vintage furs across the board, says Cowit, including mink, fox and beaver in oversized silhouettes \u2013 from the likes of Christian Dior, Fendi, Oscar de la Renta, Prada and YSL. \"Once these brands come in, they go rather quickly.\"\nOn the catwalks at the recent fashion weeks, much of the fur was faux, although among the headlines at Paris Fashion Week was a mink coat made from real vintage fur at Gabriela Hearst, a designer label that positions itself as \"luxury with a conscience\".\nAnimal rights campaigners don't accept the vintage argument. \"Regardless of when the damage was done, vintage fur remains clothing made from the skin of a needlessly killed and caged animal,\" says Emma H\u00e5kansson, founder of Collective Fashion Justice. \"It is an ongoing symbol of human supremacy over other animals, and we should not accept that in the 21st Century when we have myriad other options without animal exploitation, wildlife killing or factory farming.\"\nAmong the new-generation alternatives to fossil-fuel-made fur and real animal skin is Savian, a 100% plant-based fur made from nettle, flax and hemp sourced from Europe and produced in Italy. Developed by material science company BioFluff, Savian launched in the form of a longline coat by Stella McCartney during COP28 in November 2023, and was later used in 2024 by Danish fashion brand Ganni to create a collection of bags for Copenhagen Fashion Week.\n\"We are working with several fashion brands across the luxury, contemporary and accessible markets to develop materials that are suited to their needs,\" BioFluff co-founder Roni Gamzon tells the BBC, adding that cost remains a challenge to scaling up the adoption of new-gen materials. \"So many brands have built a reliance on low-cost synthetic materials manufactured at mass in the Far East, making it impossible for us to compete purely on pricing.\"\nBioFluff is part of La Maison des Startups, a programme from LVMH to help accelerate the implementation of new solutions within its portfolio of brands, which includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and C\u00e9line. Conversely, LVMH also helps to fund The International Fur Federation, paying \u20ac300,000 ($318,000) for Furmark membership, a global certification and traceability system for real fur.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Ten items in your wardrobe is enough \u2013 here's why\n\u2022 The Indigenous-American supermodel bringing change\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\nThe argument that synthetic fur has a higher environmental impact than real fur is questioned by a 2013 scientific study, which compared the impact of natural mink fur coats against that of faux fur coats, and found that the production of natural mink fur had the highest climate impact. When this study is considered alongside two other facts \u2013 approximately 100 million animals are killed for their fur and more than 100 billion items of clothing are produced globally each year (with 65% ending up in landfill within 12 months) \u2013 is the production of new fur clothing ever justified?\nCowit, who continues to sell both new and vintage furs, believes it's up to customers to make the choice, while Radclyffe-Thomas says her anti-real-fur views were challenged when she worked in the US and met people for whom hunting and trapping were part of their traditions.\n\"For many Indigenous cultures, fur and animal skins are part of a cultural heritage used for ceremonial and everyday dress, and I do think that there is an argument for respecting this,\" she says, before recalling her early student days where she learnt sewing techniques from a furrier. \"Those classes brought home to me the reality of the number of animals killed for clothing, and pretty much cemented my personal view: I have never considered buying real fur.\"\nThree Things to Help Heal the Planet by Ana Santi is published by Welbeck Balance.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "A saliva test may help \"turn the tide\" on prostate cancer, UK scientists claim. \nIt analyses men's DNA to work out who was born with the greatest risk of developing the disease. \nTargeting them for prostate biopsies and MRI scans discovered some aggressive cancers that would otherwise have gone unnoticed.\nHowever, the test has not yet been proven to save lives and experts say it will be  \"years\" before such tests could be used routinely. \nAround 12,000 men in the UK die from prostate cancer every year. \nCalls for the routine testing of healthy men - known as screening - have grown louder since Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy announced he had terminal prostate cancer.   \nScreening has been rejected in the past because using the current test - which looks for levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood - risks causing more harm than good. \nThis saliva test does not look for signs of prostate cancer inside the body. \nInstead it looks for 130 mutations in men's DNA, each of which can increase the risk of prostate cancers developing.  \nIn the study, scientists tested men aged 55-69 and calculated their risk. Men in the top 10% of scores were invited for further investigations. This included a biopsy and an MRI scan. \nThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed:\n\"With this test, it could be possible to turn the tide on prostate cancer,\" said Prof Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London. \n\"We can identify men at risk of aggressive cancers who need further tests and spare the men who are at lower risk from unnecessary treatments,\" she added\nDheeresh Turnbull, who is 71 and from Brighton, took part in the trial. \nHe discovered he was in the highest risk category despite having no family history of prostate cancer. Further examination showed he had cancer. \n\"I was completely shocked, I would never have been diagnosed at this stage if I hadn't joined the trial.\"\nHis younger brother was then invited to take part in the study and also discovered he had an aggressive tumour. \n\"It's incredible to think that because of this study two lives have now been saved in my family,\" Dheeresh said.\nHowever, the test is not ready to be rolled out. \nProf Dusko Ilic, from King's College London, said it was \"promising\" but improved cancer detection \"only modestly\" when used alongside current risk factors such as age, PSA levels and MRI scans. \nAnd he said there was still \"no direct evidence\" of it improving survival or quality of life, which meant more studies were needed.\nThe research also focused people of European ancestry and work is still under way to adapt it for people from other backgrounds. Black men are thought to have double the risk of prostate cancer. \nThe research team also say there are questions around cost-effectiveness, potential harms and the best time to analyse the risk.\nThe saliva test will become part of the pivotal Transform trial which is trying to discover the best way of introducing prostate cancer screening in the UK. \nProf Michael Inouye, from the University of Cambridge, said he believes we will look back on this study \"as a landmark\" that made the case for using genetics to assess risk.\nBut he added: \"This is a big step along the path to clinical implementation, but it is still a long road.\"\nHe said it will \"likely be years\" before the NHS used such a test. \nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.",

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

There needs to be greater understanding that mouth is part of the body.\n\"We had players at screenings complaining of dental pain, bleeding gums, saying they were unable to train at some points because of dental infections. Once there has been trauma there can be ongoing problems, including with their ability and willingness to compete.\"\nFactors identified included poor hygiene habits such as a lack of brushing and flossing, high levels of sugary sports and fizzy drink consumption, and stress - possibly due to a high-performance environment - which can cause teeth grinding and lead to decay.\nThe study also suggested some cases of tooth wear were related to gastric acids, with dental screenings revealing patterns similar to those from acid reflux and even in eating disorders like bulimia.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\nThe study is the first to investigate oral health among footballers aged 16 to 18, and the first to include female players.\nDr Konviser said he was \"surprised\" by the comparatively high levels of decay and disorders, given these are athletes in elite sporting set-ups whose health is being constantly assessed.\n\"There are many possible causes of wear, and we are not there to diagnose anything but to flag problems to medical teams,\" he said. \"It was surprising to see the prevalence, especially among younger age groups.\"\nOnly 76% of players confirmed that they brush their teeth twice a day, compared to 81% of 15-year-olds in England.\nIt found 76.8% of the players in the study had gingivitis - inflammation of the gums - compared to just 40% of 15-year-olds in England, with 22.5% showing signs of irreversible gum disease.\nVisible decay that required treatment was present in 31.2% of players, compared to 24% of 15-year-olds across England, while moderate to severe levels of tooth wear was seen in 15.5% of participants.\nThe study found players were relying on a pre-season check-up rather than visiting the dentist regularly, with one in five having not attended the dentist in more than two years.\nIt said findings correspond to high levels of oral disease in male senior players identified in a previous UCL-led study in 2016, which found football players' oral health was 10% worse than average for men of the same age.\nDr Konviser said clubs had been \"very receptive\" of the study - which was initially conceived in 2019 but delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, then took several years to come to fruition - and called on those clubs and the FA to take a \"top-down approach\" to making \"sports dentistry routine among players\".\nAmong solutions suggested are players rinsing their mouths with water after consuming energy drinks, and being encouraged to go to regular dental check-ups.",

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.\nExperts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.\nPassengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.\nThe digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.\nLying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.\nThis would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.\nAll died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.\n\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"\nA new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.\nIt takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.\n\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.\nThe simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.\nTitanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. \nBut the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.\n\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.\n\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"\nUnfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.\nThe human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.\nPersonal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.\nThe scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.\n\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\"",

        "article_text": "President Trump has been justifying his sweeping tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\".\nHe has imposed tariffs - or import taxes - on countries around the world, including a 125% rate on goods imported from China. In response, China is hiking its tariffs on American imports. \nSome of Trump's claims on trade are unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\n\"We're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\", Trump has said about his new tariff regime on Tuesday. \nBBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 7 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $215m (\u00a3168m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based it on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs (as of 2 April) is 22%. \nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level. \nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April. \nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day. \nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. \nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported. \nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. \nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\". \n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said. \nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false. \nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false. \nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA.  \nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.\nExperts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.\nPassengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.\nThe digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.\nLying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.\nThis would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.\nAll died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.\n\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"\nA new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.\nIt takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.\n\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.\nThe simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.\nTitanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. \nBut the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.\n\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.\n\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"\nUnfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.\nThe human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.\nPersonal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.\nThe scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.\n\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\"",

Although it is not expected to be fully operational until the 2030s, Universal has said there would be a new railway station near the park.A car park is in the conceptual art of the park. \"At this point it will be little details they tweak, like 'Let's use a different shade of paint on that Lord of the Rings castle',\" they said.The locations can be seen on the map of what the site could look like, although specific details, such as the Hill Valley clock from Back to the Future, have been obscured.Rides have already been designed, with the majority planned as indoor attractions.Rollercoasters based on Back to the Future, Jurassic Park and Minions are among the few rides that will not be under cover.There will be a stunt show based on 007, similar to the The Bourne Stuntacular in Florida.",

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Now he is determined to do similar damage to Rangers and keep Athletic Bilbao on course for their first European trophy.\nIn the space of 100 days, Williams produced two showpiece man-of-the-match performances.\nFirst, he helped end Bilbao's four-decade wait for silverware, then he opened the scoring for Spain in the German capital as his country won their fourth European Championship title.\nFans and the game's biggest clubs across the continent gazed lovingly at this football maverick, who exploded onto the scene a few seasons ago but whose stock has risen 10-fold in the past 12 months. \nThat ascent began with his role in winning last year's Copa Del Rey, Athletic Club's first success since a league and cup double in 1984.\nBorn in Pamplona, Williams regularly acknowledges the life he has been afforded came despite his parents' struggles in Ghana before they fled for Spain.\nAfter placing his Euro 2024 winners' medal round his mother's neck, he said: \"I run fast, but not as fast as my mother. She escaped death and crossed the Sahara from Ghana to Spain. I gave her my medal because she deserves it more.\"\nIt seems that the humble Williams will have his pick when it comes to his next club, with Arsenal the latest to be heavily linked with his services.\nNot that he is in a rush to leave Bilbao. They are his club. \n\"I was the first one to cry, you can't even imagine what this feels like,\" he said after their historic Spanish Cup win against Mallorca in Seville's Cartuja. \n\"It's a dream to win with the club of my life,\" he said.\nFor the club it was monumental, coming after no fewer than seven straight cup final defeats, including in the 2012 Europa League.\nThe coronavirus pandemic meant they wrote unwanted history in 2021, losing two Copa del Rey finals in the space of two weeks to Basque rivals Real Sociedad and then Barcelona.\nThe tactical & mental reasons behind Jekyll and Hyde Rangers\nFerguson hopes 'long chat' bears fruit v Bilbao\n'Top-class Butland making too many regular mistakes'\nMaking their eventual success all the sweeter for Williams was the fact his older brother Inaki \u2013 who represents the country of his parents \u2013 was alongside him in the Bilbao team.\nWith Bilbao hosting this season's Europa League final at the impressive Estadio San Mames, the Williams brothers are doubly determined to brush Rangers aside and take a big step closer to the reality of winning the trophy on their own patch.\nAs Jose Mourinho was at pains to point out as he gazed upon the burning ashes of Fenerbahce's shoot-out defeat at Ibrox, Athletic Club are big favourites to move into a semi-final against Lyon or Manchester United.\nWith Nico and Inaki, who have both scored five Europa League goals this season, on the flanks, manager Ernesto Valverde has potency at the top of the pitch in addition to the joint-best defence in La Liga at his disposal.\n\"This title is unlike any other,\" said Valverde - in his third spell in charge of the club - when they lifted the Copa del Rey. \nHowever they could top that in six weeks' time.\nHaving overcome Roma in the last 16, the former Barcelona and Olympiacos coach is determined to build on last season's cup win with another trophy.\nChampions League football next season is also within sight with the club sitting fourth in the Spanish top flight.\nNico's Spain team-mate Oihan Sancet, their top scorer in the league this season, has made a timely return to the fold after a thigh problem. He made a cameo appearance from the bench during their goalless draw at Villareal on Sunday.\nKey defender Dani Vivian, with the Copa del Rey trophy that ended Athletic Club's drought\nThat was a second stalemate in succession, but one which prevented their closest challengers for that final La Liga Champions League spot from making up ground.\nSpain's number one Unai Simon will sit Thursday's game out as Athletic Club's number two Julen Agirrezabala plays in their European matches. \nHowever, you realise that is not a big downgrade when you see the crucial saves he made against Mallorca - including in the penalty shoot-out that decided the King's Cup's destination a year ago.\nThere are doubts over the fitness of centre-back Aitor Paredes but Valverde is hopeful he will take his usual position beside the rock-solid Dani Vivian at the heart of the Bilbao backline.\nRangers may take a degree of optimism from the fact Bilbao are not in red-hot form though. They have won two of their last seven games and scored just once in their last three.\nHowever, this is a step up in class for Barry Ferguson's men and, thanks largely to the Williams brothers, The Lions have rediscovered their roar.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

So how does it work? We have already seen SAOT in this season's Champions League and in the FA Cup from the fifth round onwards.When a tight offside decision goes to a VAR review, SAOT steps in.Previously, officials in the VAR room needed to decide on three key things - when the ball was kicked, where and at what angle the defender's body was when the ball was kicked and where and what angle the attacker's body was at the moment of contact.Viewers at home have seen this manual process played out with lines drawn with crosshairs on freeze-frame replays shown on their TV screens.All three of those decisions will now be automatically taken by the technology to remove some elements of human subjectivity, such as which frame to freeze as the ball is kicked.Bespoke cameras have been installed beneath the roof at all 20 Premier League stadiums to monitor a variety of key elements.About 30 cameras - working at 100 frames per second - will track the exact movement of the ball as well as 10,000 data points on the bodies of all 22 players.It means it can be automatically determined whether an attacking player's body was beyond the last defender at the exact time the ball was played.VAR officials check the system has correctly determined the three key points it measures before confirming the decision. The on-field officials then inform the players.A 3D animation of the decision produced by the artificial intelligence will then be played on television for viewers at home and on big screens in the stadium.As yet, the officials will not speak to the crowd, as has been seen in the Carabao Cup.Will it end the lengthy delays?Image source, The FAImage caption, We've already seen SAOT working in the FA Cup and Champions League this seasonIn short, a little.But it's important to remember we are only talking about offside decisions here - which are largely factual - and not subjective refereeing calls on goals, penalties and red cards, which will still go to VAR.SAOT will increase the speed of the virtual offside line placements and it will help in crowded penalty areas.The delay in disallowing Moises Caicedo's goal in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Tottenham was about four minutes, and there is confidence SAOT would have cut that wait by about two minutes.But it would not have reduced the time - more than three minutes - that it took to disallow Pape Sarr's goal in the same game which led to Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou claiming that VAR was \"killing the game\".

        "article_text": "Double gameweek season has arrived in Fantasy Premier League and it starts with a simple two-team one in gameweek 32.\nIt means a lot of FPL players will have similar teams - or at least similar players who double - but there are still plenty of questions to ponder.\nShould I bench boost? Should I play the Triple Captain chip? And which Crystal Palace and Newcastle players are the best picks?\nOur team of the week should help you with a few of those dilemmas.\nSet your calendar reminders for Friday 11 April when expert FPL Heisenberg is a special guest on the BBC Sport website for a live FPL question and answer session at 15:30 BST.\nThe next few weeks look like this:\nGameweek 32 - double gameweek for Newcastle and Crystal Palace\nGameweek 33 - double gameweek for Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal Palace\nGameweek 34 - blank gameweek for Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal Palace\nGameweek 35 - normal gameweek\nAnd we know the FA Cup final might bring more doubles in 36 and blanks in 37.\nYou've got a massive chance for big points, especially if you've kept a few of your chips back.\nA bench boost would work this week or next. It's obviously team dependant and I'd plan out your squad for both weeks and decide which one feels the most exciting. You're not going to get a full squad of players going twice in either week, so a lot will depend on your single gameweek players.\nNottingham Forest, Brighton and Chelsea players look good this week.\nIn gameweek 33, Liverpool visit Leicester and you could put in West Ham and Manchester United players against Southampton and Wolves respectively.\nIf you haven't yet used your wildcard, now could be the time to set you up for two double gameweeks.\nPicking when you are going to play your Triple Captain chip might be a good way of setting your strategy for the rest of the season - and deciding when Bench Boost is played.\nI think there are three main choices.\n1. Newcastle's Alexander Isak this week - safe, high-upside, but lots of players will make the same decision so if you are chasing points look elsewhere.\n2. Arsenal's Bukayo Saka in week 33 - Ipswich away and Palace at home is juicy, Saka can easily put back-to-back hauls together. But will he start both games?\n3. Wait for week 36 - your hope is Manchester City get to the FA Cup final as one of their games in a potential double would be Southampton away. It's risky waiting this long but could well pay off.\nCaptain Isak did not pay off, with no goal contributions in a 3-0 Newcastle win. \nSaka and fellow Arsenal forward Gabriel Martinelli being benched also hurt.\nBut Jacob Murphy (16 points) and Liam Delap (8) saved the day for 47 points.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nMatz Sels has 11 bonus points to go with his 13 clean sheets this season\nMatz Sels, Nottingham Forest, keeper, \u00a35.1m - Everton (h)\nThe top-scoring keeper, the second-most clean sheets in the league (13) and a home game against a hardly-prolific Everton side.\nYou don't need underlying statistics to back up this pick but here is one anyway - Everton's expected goals (xG) on the road (14.18) is lower than every other team, except Leicester and Southampton, who are both set for relegation.\nNeco Williams, Nottingham Forest, \u00a34.4m - Everton (h)\nDoubling up on a top FPL defence this week. You might look at the points total and think Nikola Milenkovic (\u00a35.1m) is the best Forest asset, having scored four goals.\nBut Williams is the underlying data pick. Since gameweek 25, Milenkovic has scored twice from four shots, two of which were on target.\nWilliams, by contrast, leads the team with 10 shots, seven key passes, one big chance created and an xG of 0.55.\nMilenkovic is a threat from corners, but Williams has more avenues to points from open play.\nDaniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, \u00a35.2m - Man City and Newcastle (both a)\nIf Munoz isn't in your team already then what have you been doing?

Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "It's having a moment with celebrities, fashionistas and Gen Z. But wearing any kind of fur, from vintage to synthetic, poses some difficult questions. Could a new plant-based faux fur be the way forward?\nFrom Tory Burch in New York and Simone Rocha in London, to Fendi in Milan and Miu Miu in Paris, fur dominated the autumn/winter 2025-26 catwalks. And celebrities matched the runways, with Hailey Bieber, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift and Rihanna all spending the start of the year wrapped up in faux and vintage fur coats.\nThe last time fur hit the headlines was in 2017, when Gucci pledged to go fur-free, influencing a host of designer brands to follow suit. The move was welcomed by animal rights campaigners, but what followed was the scaling of a new problem: much of the real fur has been replaced by synthetic alternatives that are derived from fossil fuels. Given the tensions around animal welfare and the environment, why is fur now firmly back in fashion?\nIt began in early 2024 with the arrival of the mob wife aesthetic, an ostentatious, glamorous response to the understated, minimalist trend that preceded it: stealth wealth. \"Reviving historical looks for contemporary wear is a natural part of the fashion cycle. It's escapism, and who doesn't want some of that?\" says Natascha Radclyffe-Thomas, associate professor, MBA fashion business and entrepreneurship, at Ravensbourne University, London. \"I was in the room when [former CEO] Marco Bizzarri announced Gucci would no longer use animal fur in its collections, and remember what an amazing shift this was for an Italian luxury brand where fur was such a prevalent material. But the topic of faux fur is such a tricky one, too.\"\nRadclyffe-Thomas adds that, since designer labels' decision to ban real fur from their collections, the faux-fur market has evolved from the early days of \"fun\" fur \u2013 low cost, often in bright colours that didn't attempt to imitate the real thing \u2013 to a new level of quality where most consumers wouldn't know the difference between real and fake.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe production of fossil fuel-based fabrics continues to rise globally, with polyester the most common, accounting for 57% of all fibre production. Even clothing made from recycled polyester is problematic because the model isn't circular. The vast majority is made using plastic bottles \u2013\u00a0 not old textiles \u2013 which means that it can't be recycled again, and will most likely end up in landfill at some point.\nOne way to keep faux fur out of landfill \u2013\u00a0 or delay its final destination \u2013 is to keep it in circulation. At fashion rental company By Rotation, the rental of faux fur and wool coats has been increasing since even before the recent catwalk shows. London label Charlotte Simone \u2013\u00a0 whose faux fur coats have been worn by Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa and Madonna \u2013 is the third most rented brand across coats and jackets. \"Higher quality, well-made faux fur, especially from designer brands, tends to last longer, meaning it's more likely to be passed down, resold or rented rather than discarded,\" By Rotation founder and CEO, Eshita Kabra-Davies, tells the BBC.\nThe global second hand clothing market is expected to reach $367bn by 2029, with a record number of shoppers having bought pre-loved clothes in 2024. This year, since the autumn/winter 2025-26 collections were shown, searches for both real and faux fur have spiked at rental platforms and online retailers.\u00a0\nHolly Watkins, owner of vintage boutique One Scoop Store in north London, says that in the past few years she has seen a considerable shift away from selling real fur to fake alternatives, in response to changing tastes and demands from her customers. \"I only sell real fur if it's a super-special vintage piece which I can't say no to, or has a detachable collar or trim,\" she tells the BBC. \"Personally, I don't have a problem with old [real] fur \u2013 it's better to prolong its life than send it to landfill. I have more of a problem with polyester, in that it will never biodegrade.\"\nBut from conversations with vintage dealers in west London\u00a0\u2013 home to the likes of Portobello market \u2013 Watkins says that many stores have never stopped selling real fur, both old and new, with younger shoppers helping to drive the trend.\u00a0\n\"Fashion turned on fur. Young customers want more\" was the headline of a recent Wall Street Journal article \u2013 and the consensus does seem to be that Gen Z is leading the revival of vintage fur. Madison Avenue Furs, the largest buyer of pre-owned fur in the US, reports a significant uplift in sales, particularly of pre-owned pieces. \"We saw college students coming in to buy fur, which we haven't seen in years,\" Larry Cowit, owner of Madison Avenue Furs, tells the BBC. \"The vintage furs against the new furs was a concern for many of the younger buyers and \u2013 ethically \u2013 they were comfortable with vintage.\"\nCustomers are buying vintage furs across the board, says Cowit, including mink, fox and beaver in oversized silhouettes \u2013 from the likes of Christian Dior, Fendi, Oscar de la Renta, Prada and YSL. \"Once these brands come in, they go rather quickly.\"\nOn the catwalks at the recent fashion weeks, much of the fur was faux, although among the headlines at Paris Fashion Week was a mink coat made from real vintage fur at Gabriela Hearst, a designer label that positions itself as \"luxury with a conscience\".\nAnimal rights campaigners don't accept the vintage argument. \"Regardless of when the damage was done, vintage fur remains clothing made from the skin of a needlessly killed and caged animal,\" says Emma H\u00e5kansson, founder of Collective Fashion Justice. \"It is an ongoing symbol of human supremacy over other animals, and we should not accept that in the 21st Century when we have myriad other options without animal exploitation, wildlife killing or factory farming.\"\nAmong the new-generation alternatives to fossil-fuel-made fur and real animal skin is Savian, a 100% plant-based fur made from nettle, flax and hemp sourced from Europe and produced in Italy. Developed by material science company BioFluff, Savian launched in the form of a longline coat by Stella McCartney during COP28 in November 2023, and was later used in 2024 by Danish fashion brand Ganni to create a collection of bags for Copenhagen Fashion Week.\n\"We are working with several fashion brands across the luxury, contemporary and accessible markets to develop materials that are suited to their needs,\" BioFluff co-founder Roni Gamzon tells the BBC, adding that cost remains a challenge to scaling up the adoption of new-gen materials. \"So many brands have built a reliance on low-cost synthetic materials manufactured at mass in the Far East, making it impossible for us to compete purely on pricing.\"\nBioFluff is part of La Maison des Startups, a programme from LVMH to help accelerate the implementation of new solutions within its portfolio of brands, which includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and C\u00e9line. Conversely, LVMH also helps to fund The International Fur Federation, paying \u20ac300,000 ($318,000) for Furmark membership, a global certification and traceability system for real fur.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Ten items in your wardrobe is enough \u2013 here's why\n\u2022 The Indigenous-American supermodel bringing change\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\nThe argument that synthetic fur has a higher environmental impact than real fur is questioned by a 2013 scientific study, which compared the impact of natural mink fur coats against that of faux fur coats, and found that the production of natural mink fur had the highest climate impact. When this study is considered alongside two other facts \u2013 approximately 100 million animals are killed for their fur and more than 100 billion items of clothing are produced globally each year (with 65% ending up in landfill within 12 months) \u2013 is the production of new fur clothing ever justified?\nCowit, who continues to sell both new and vintage furs, believes it's up to customers to make the choice, while Radclyffe-Thomas says her anti-real-fur views were challenged when she worked in the US and met people for whom hunting and trapping were part of their traditions.\n\"For many Indigenous cultures, fur and animal skins are part of a cultural heritage used for ceremonial and everyday dress, and I do think that there is an argument for respecting this,\" she says, before recalling her early student days where she learnt sewing techniques from a furrier. \"Those classes brought home to me the reality of the number of animals killed for clothing, and pretty much cemented my personal view: I have never considered buying real fur.\"\nThree Things to Help Heal the Planet by Ana Santi is published by Welbeck Balance.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "'Red and green should never be seen', apparently - but Bernhard Langer was delighted to pair his red polo shirt with the iconic Green Jacket in 1985\nWhen Tiger Woods romped to his first Masters title in 1997, he did so wearing a red top that quickly became established as his iconic Sunday colour.\nBut the American, who would go on to win five times at Augusta National, was not the first to make the fashion faux pas of pairing a red polo shirt with the Green Jacket.\nForty years ago this weekend, Bernhard Langer set the tone as he marched to the first of his two Masters victories - he even wore red trousers, too.\n\"I always tease Tiger,\" said the 67-year-old, who was close to tears as he talked about playing in his 41st and final Masters this week.\n\"See, I was the one wearing a red shirt first; you came later.\" \nLanger has previously joked that he \"looked like a Christmas tree\" when he donned the famous Green Jacket for the first time in 1985.\n\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\n'McIlroy's Masters memories must be turned into a positive'\nCabrera wins on eve of Masters return after time in prison\nHis final Masters was supposed to be last year but a snapped Achilles tendon - an injury suffered while playing pickleball - meant the German couldn't play. So he delayed saying farewell to a place that means so much to him.\n\"They're the two most important wins in my career,\" he said of his 1985 and 1993 victories at Augusta, which are his sole major triumphs.\n\"It's emotional. You can tell already my voice is breaking a bit just realising it's going to be my last competitive Masters.\"\nLanger has conceded for many years that he no longer has the game to compete at Augusta; three missed cuts in his past three Masters are testament to that.\n\"The course is just getting too long and I'm getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \n\"I'm hitting hybrids [into greens] where the other kids are hitting nine-irons, maybe even wedges. So I knew I wasn't going to be in contention anymore.\n\"A few years back I asked the chairman of the club, 'is there a time limit? Do we age out when we're 60?'. He said, 'no, you will know when it's time to quit, it's totally up to you'.\n\"It is time to quit.\"\nLyle, Langer, Woosnam, Olazabal, Ballesteros and Faldo were victorious at Augusta National in an extraordinary era of success for European golf\nLanger was runner-up at The Open twice and third on three occasions in a career that promised more major success.\nThat he was unable to add a major other than his two at Augusta only intensifies his link to this fabled corner of Georgia.\nIn 40 appearances, he has made the cut 27 times and finished inside the top 10 nine times.\n\"It's been an incredible journey, for a young man born in a village of 800 people [in Bavaria, southern Germany], where golf was nothing, to make it here,\" he said.\n\"To get an invitation to play the Masters when it was extremely difficult for European or international players to get one, and then to win the Masters on the third go was just a dream come true.\"\nHe was just the third non-American winner, following in the footsteps of South Africa's three-time champion Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who won twice. \nHis win cemented belief among Europeans that success could be achieved at Augusta.\nBallesteros paved the way with his victories in 1980 and 1983, before Langer won his first two years later. \nThen Scotland's Sandy Lyle, England's Nick Faldo (twice) Wales' Ian Woosnam, Langer again and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal collected six of seven titles from 1988.\nLanger's debut was in 1982, two years after Ballesteros had broken the glass ceiling. \nThe German's initial experience was hardly noteworthy. He shot 77 and 78 to miss the halfway cut by one stroke after three-putting 11 times in 36 holes on unfamiliar greens that were too slick for a naive 24-year-old.\n\"Coming here the first time, driving down Magnolia Lane, seeing this place for the first time was an eye-opener,\" he said. \n\"I had never seen a golf course manicured like this or a tournament run as efficiently as this has been.\"\nBy the time Langer won his second title in 1993, he was married with three children\nHe vowed to come back better prepared and when he returned two years later he made it through to the weekend - the first of an incredible run of 19 successive Masters that Langer would play all four rounds.\nHis victory 12 months later was secured with a classic back-nine Augusta charge. He birdied four out of six holes from the 12th as he overturned a three-shot deficit to Curtis Strange, who dropped shots on three of his final five holes.\nLanger bogeyed the 18th but still beat Strange, Ray Floyd and his playing partner Ballesteros by two shots.\nHe made a solid defence of his title in 1986 and briefly shared the lead in the final round before Jack Nicklaus produced a back nine for the ages to clinch his record-extending sixth Green Jacket and 18th major title.\nThat week was also memorable for witnessing the first time a world ranking was published, and it was Langer who had the honour of topping the inaugural list.\nHe was becoming something of an Augusta specialist and the love affair strengthened with two more top 10s before he claimed his second victory in 1993.\nLanger was challenged by unheralded American Dan Forsman in the final round. \nForsman was one shot behind the German when he teed off on the notoriously tricky par-three 12th. He dumped two balls in the water, walked off with a quadruple-bogey seven and was barely heard of again.\nIn contrast, Langer's name continued to pepper the leaderboards at Augusta, with top 10s in 1997, 2001 and 2004. \nHe finished joint eighth at the age of 56 in 2014 and held the record for the oldest player to make the cut - at the age of 63 in 2020 - until Fred Couples eclipsed that in 2023.\nThis is Langer's final Masters but not the end of competitive golf for the former Ryder Cup captain, who looks as fit as he did in his pomp.\nHe shows no signs of slowing down on the PGA Tour Champions - the US-based seniors tour - and has racked up at least one victory a year since joining the circuit in 2007 when he turned 50. \nHe has won 12 majors among 47 senior victories - both of which are records.\nThis week he is back among the game's youthful elite though, and will seek to end his Masters career with the same controlled elegance with which he has played throughout his career.\nHe will not contend for the title. That is clear. Instead, the question is whether his Masters career ends after round two on Friday, or if he defies his own expectations and makes the cut.\n\"After four decades it's going to be bittersweet,\" he said.\n\"When I'm inside the ropes, my mind switches to being a competitor, play golf and take care of the task in front of me. \n\"But I might get a bit emotional looking around, seeing my family, my kids, my grandkids, my brother and other friends that are going to be supporting me this week.\n\"I love the Masters more than any tournament in the world. I'm expecting it to be very difficult emotionally.\"",

Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"\nIn a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.\nEmber is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling. \nBut this hasn't happened yet due to increasing global demand for electricity. \nCheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.\nChina continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.\nThough it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India. \nWind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.\nThe report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.\nThe big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy. \nThat means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.\nAccording to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024. \nThis was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.\nIn the last five years, fast-growing Asian economies, in particular India and China, have continued expanding their use of fossil fuels to meet rapidly rising demand for electricity.

That is when there is expectation to win. That is when the fans are on you. There are 20 minutes to go, it's 0-0 or you are getting beaten. The pressure is heaped on you. Have you got it in you to stand up and be counted?\nThat is what makes or breaks a Rangers player. And, in this squad, there are not enough players with the mentality to get through those periods. That for me is where this squad is at - and that is the aspect that has let them down.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\nThis video can not be played\nSaturday's loss to Hibernian set an unwanted Rangers record of five straight home defeats\nThat is separate to the technical attributes of these players, though. They are good footballers. They have shown that in European games. They have shown that against Celtic. \nIt was only last month they knocked Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce out of the Europa League and went to Celtic Park and won for the first time in years.\nBut those games bring a different pressure. They bring a different expectation. Going into big European games, especially in the knockout rounds, rarely is there expectancy on Rangers to win.\nMeanwhile, domestically, they simply need to win, win, win. Their tempo needs to be high. They need to commit more bodies forward. \nHow many times have you watched a Rangers game where their two centre-halves are in the attacking half against one striker? That is because, in basic terms, they have to commit more in an attacking sense.\nBut you are at risk if you lose the ball. Just look at Hibernian's second goal on Saturday. It comes from a point where Rangers' defensive-minded players are in Hibs' half.\nIn Europe, you will rarely see that situation with a Rangers team, because they have more focus on the defensive side of their game.\nThe easier thing to do in football is be a defensive team. That is what I think this Rangers team are more comfortable doing. They feel more at ease playing in a defensively organised team that can then counter-attack. \nWhy is it easier? Well, in those moments, you are not coaching a set pattern to break a team down. When that is your gameplan, inevitably when you get possession, the opposition are not set up to be broken down. \nThese Rangers players are intelligent footballers. They get the gameplan of stopping the opposition and being clinical on the counter. They have shown that under Barry Ferguson away to Fenerbahce and Celtic playing in a 3-4-3 set-up.\nIn those games, when Rangers have won the ball, they have been in positions to score goals because even when they are sitting deep in a defensive formation, they always have three attackers forward.\nDefensively, they have more players deeper in the pitch and enough bodies to defend. And, in the attacking sense, having one striker and two number 10s means it is not just Cyriel Dessers or Vaclav Cerny running forward themselves.\nRangers' average player positions in last month's 3-1 win at Fenerbahce (left) and Saturday's defeat at home to Hibs (right) show a stark contrast between where their defensive line typically sits in European and domestic games\nThat approach did not work so well in the home leg against Fenerbahce, or the first half of their league game at Dundee, when they were perhaps expected to take the game to the opposition.\nBut for Thursday's encounter with Athletic Bilbao, I feel the first leg being at home should suit Rangers.\nMost European games that are two-legged affairs, particular in the latter stages of competitions, the first leg is always more cagey. It will probably be accepted a bit more by the Ibrox crowd if Rangers are a bit more solid. \nRangers would bite your hand off to go into that second leg in Bilbao at 0-0. But, make no mistake about it, this will be their toughest European game to date this season. \nThey are going to face a seriously technical team who are fourth in Spain's top flight. They have a top, top coach like Ernesto Valverde - a two-time La Liga winner as Barcelona boss - and they play with good tempo in their approach. \nThat is their model and how they play, so expect their set-up behind the ball to be really good if counter-attack opportunities arise for Rangers.\nThere is no getting away from how big a task this is for Ferguson and his unpredictable players, but that is not to say they cannot hurt them - they can.\nFormer Rangers striker Steven Naismith was speaking to BBC Sport Scotland's Nick McPheat",

Delap also fits Ruben Amorim's system and the United coach has frequently said his team do not score enough.\nOn that basis, and because talk of a move for Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres is now going cold, a transfer is a no-brainer.\nThe problem for United is the uncertainty over how much money they will have to spend in the summer - they will either earn Champions League qualification via winning the Europa League... or have no European football at all.\nAmorim has said he needs to assess gaps in his squad and where his priorities lie. \nUnited also know there will be a lot of competition for Delap and that could drive the price up beyond \u00a330m, and will drive wages up. It is one of the reasons why they are quite keen to offload high-earners Casemiro and Marcus Rashford this summer, because the comparison with their salaries doesn't help in negotiations either.\nDelap to United could definitely happen. But it is not nailed on.\nBBC Sport football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella:\nChelsea sources have signalled interest in Delap in recent months. \nManager Enzo Maresca worked with him in Manchester City's academy team. Similarly, so did influential recruiter Joe Shields and new academy technical director Glenn van der Kraan. \nThose personal relationships make the Stamford Bridge club serious contenders for his signature, but they are reportedly also interested in RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting's Gyokeres. \nThe new Chelsea regime are also known to prefer signing players that have release clauses written into their contracts.\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport chief football news reporter:\nCity had a \u00a340m buy-back agreement on Delap when they sold him to Ipswich last summer.\nThey also have a 20% sell-on clause on any profit Ipswich make beyond the \u00a320m they initially spent.\nWith Erling Haaland tied to a contract that does not expire until 2034, Omar Marmoush impressing since his winter arrival from Eintracht Frankfurt and Jeremy Doku and Savinho both in favour with Pep Guardiola this season in wide positions, it does not appear City have room for Delap in a way that would offer regular starts, which surely has to be a key selling point.\nIn addition, even with five Champions League spots for English teams, it is not certain City will be in Europe's top competition next season, which is a factor.\nOn that basis City would be unlikely to make a move, although, with a new technical director in Hugo Viana and a summer rebuild on the cards, that does bring an element of the unknown.\nBBC Sport pundit Chris Sutton:\nFor \u00a330m, of course a lot of big teams will be looking at him.\nIt would be a risk going to United with the lack of creativity that they have, but he would be an upgrade on what they have got.\nCompared to Chelsea's main striker, Nicolas Jackson, he is far more physical. He can still run in behind defences but is far more of an all-rounder. Part of the game which I think he could improve is aerially, considering he is 6ft 1in (1.85m).\nWhat I really like is that he has got that sort of swagger about him, and that attitude where he knows he is good, which you need at the bigger clubs.\nHe is too good for Ipswich. I don't want to upset their fans but he was a good signing and a brilliant bit of business for them, and they have enjoyed watching him play. Nobody is going to begrudge him leaving to go to a bigger club.\nIf he went to somewhere like Chelsea or Manchester United then he could be another player who bites Pep in the backside, like Cole Palmer did.\nBut going back to City behind other forwards is not going to help his development, or his England chances.\nArsenal have been linked heavily with Sesko and Gyokeres but not Delap. \nWest Ham are known to want a striker in the summer while Aston Villa and Newcastle could emerge as suitors.\nVilla sold striker Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr in January but signed Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United as a replacement. \nNewcastle striker Callum Wilson is out of contract in the summer and Alexander Isak is continually linked with a move away, despite sources at St James' Park insisting he is not for sale. \nMuch could also come down to the PSR positions of the various clubs and which teams gain the lucrative windfall for qualifying for the Champions League next season. \nLatest Ipswich Town news, analysis and fan views\nGet Ipswich news notifications",

        "article_text": "Todd Brayman is no longer buying his favourite red wine, which is from California.\nA veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, he is one of a growing number of people in Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world, who are avoiding buying US products due to President Trump's tariffs and treatment of US allies.\n\"I have in my life served alongside American forces. It is just profoundly upsetting and disappointing to see where we are given the historical ties that our two countries have,\" says Mr Brayman, who lives in Nova Scotia.\n\"But I think right now it's time to stand up and be counted, and in my mind, that means buying local and supporting Canadian business.\"\nTogether with his wife, Mr Brayman has replaced all the American products he used to buy, including his previous wine of choice, with Canadian alternatives.\n\"Luckett Phone Box Red wine, which is from right here in Nova Scotia, is great,\" he says.\nDetermining which products are Canadian isn't always easy however. \"Sometimes labelling can be misleading,\" adds Mr Brayman.\nTo help, he now uses an app on his phone that can scan a product's barcode and identify where it's from. If the product is identified as American, the app suggests Canadian alternatives.\nThe app, called Maple Scan, is one of numerous emerging in Canada to help people shop local. Others include Buy Canadian, Is This Canadian? and Shop Canadian.\nMaple Scan's founder, Sasha Ivanov, says his app has had 100,000 downloads since it launched last month. He believes the momentum around buying Canadian is here to stay.\n\"Lots of Canadians have told me, 'I'm not going back'. It's important that we support local regardless,\" he says.\nCanadians like Mr Brayman are boycotting American products in response to a raft of import tariffs introduced by Trump. These included tariffs of 25% on all foreign cars, steel and aluminium, and 25% tariffs on other Canadian and Mexican goods.\nMeanwhile, other European Union exports will get tariffs of 20%, while the UK is facing 10%.\nTrump says the tariffs will boost US manufacturing, raise tax revenue and reduce the US trade deficit. However, they have spooked global markets, which have fallen sharply over the past month.\nTrump has even expressed a desire for Canada to join the US as its 51st state, something the Canadian government was quick to strongly reject.\nOttawa has also responded with C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) in counter tariffs, as well as additional tariffs on the US auto sector.\nAnd there has been a substantial drop in the number of Canadians travelling to the US.\nGroups dedicated to boycotting US goods have also emerged in European countries. Momentum behind the boycott is particularly strong in Denmark, whose territory of Greenland Trump has said he wants to acquire.\nDenmark's largest grocery store operator, Salling Group, recently introduced a symbol, a black star, on pricing labels to denote European brands.\nBo Albertus, a school principal who lives in Skovlunde, a suburb of Copenhagen, says joining the boycott was his way of taking action. \"Statements that Trump made about wanting to buy Greenland, that was just too much for me,\" he says.\n\"I can't do anything about the American political system, but I can vote with my credit card.\"\nOne of Mr Albertus's first moves was to cancel his subscriptions to US streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV. \"My 11-year-old daughter is a bit annoyed about it, but that's the way it is. She understands why I do it,\" he says.\nMr Albertus is the administrator for a Danish Facebook group dedicated to helping people boycott US goods. In the group, which has 90,000 members, people share recommendations for local alternatives to US goods, from shoes to lawnmowers.\nMr Albertus says: \"It's a movement that is quite a lot bigger than just our little country, so it all that adds up.\"\nMette Heerulff Christiansen, the owner of a grocery shop in Copenhagen called Broders has stopped stocking American products, such as Cheetos crisps and Hershey's chocolate, in her store. She is substituting them with Danish or European products where possible.\nMs Christiansen is also swapping out products she uses at home. She's finding some easier to replace than others. \"Coca-Cola is easy to substitute with Jolly Cola, a Danish brand,\" she says. \"But technology, like Facebook, that's totally difficult to avoid.\"\nShe believes the boycott movement in Denmark is helping people to channel their anger at Trump's policies and rhetoric. \"I think it's more for the Danish people to feel good that they are doing something,\" she says.\nDouglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, who specializes in the history of US trade policy, believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited. \"It is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the United States,\" he says.\n\"In the past, boycotts have not lasted long and have not achieved much. It starts as a hostile reaction to some US action but tends to fade with time,\" he says.\nFor now though, the rising Buy Canadian sentiment in Canada is boosting sales for many local brands. The CEO of Canadian grocer Loblaw posted on LinkedIn that weekly sales of Canadian products were up by double digits.\nBianca Parsons, from Alberta in Canada, is behind an initiative to promote locally-made goods, called Made In Alberta, which she says has had a surge in interest since the tariffs were introduced. \"We're now getting over 20,000 hits [to the site] every two weeks.\"\nMs Parsons, who is the executive director of the Alberta Food Processors Association, adds: \"I've had producers reach out to us and say: 'I'm selling out at stores that I would never sell out before, thank you so much'.\"\nSeveral Canadian provinces, including Ontario and Nova Scotia, have removed US-made alcoholic beverages from their liquor store shelves in response to tariffs, a move the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said is \"worse than tariffs\".\nAmong the American businesses feeling the impact is Caledonia Spirits, a distiller based in Vermont, near the Canadian border.  Ryan Christiansen, Caledonia's president and head distiller, says his business had an order on track for shipment to Quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced.\n\"My sense is that everyone's just being a little too aggressive and, unfortunately, I think America started that,\" says Mr Christiansen. \"I do understand that the action America took needed a counter reaction.\n\"If it were up to me, I'd be at the table trying to resolve this in a friendly way, and I'm hopeful that the leaders in America take that approach.\"\nEthan Frisch, the co-founder of Burlap & Barrel, an American spice company based in New York, which also exports to Canada, says he's more concerned with the impact of the tariffs on his company's imports and rising inflation in the US than the consumer boycott.\nHe says: \"I think there's this assumption that, if you boycott an American company, it's going to have an impact on the economy and maybe change the situation. I think that assumption, unfortunately, is not accurate.\n\"The [US] economy is crashing all up by itself. Businesses like ours are struggling without boycotts.\"",

Part of the game which I think he could improve is aerially, considering he is 6ft 1in (1.85m).\nWhat I really like is that he has got that sort of swagger about him, and that attitude where he knows he is good, which you need at the bigger clubs.\nHe is too good for Ipswich. I don't want to upset their fans but he was a good signing and a brilliant bit of business for them, and they have enjoyed watching him play. Nobody is going to begrudge him leaving to go to a bigger club.\nIf he went to somewhere like Chelsea or Manchester United then he could be another player who bites Pep in the backside, like Cole Palmer did.\nBut going back to City behind other forwards is not going to help his development, or his England chances.\nArsenal have been linked heavily with Sesko and Gyokeres but not Delap. \nWest Ham are known to want a striker in the summer while Aston Villa and Newcastle could emerge as suitors.\nVilla sold striker Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr in January but signed Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United as a replacement. \nNewcastle striker Callum Wilson is out of contract in the summer and Alexander Isak is continually linked with a move away, despite sources at St James' Park insisting he is not for sale. \nMuch could also come down to the PSR positions of the various clubs and which teams gain the lucrative windfall for qualifying for the Champions League next season. \nLatest Ipswich Town news, analysis and fan views\nGet Ipswich news notifications",

From Championship to England contention - the rise of 'fearless' DelapPublished18 JanuaryMan Utd: 'Could happen, not nailed on'Simon Stone, BBC Sport chief football news reporter:There is no doubt Manchester United will be one of the clubs with a major interest in Delap this summer.The release clause is less than United paid for Rasmus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee, and Delap has scored more goals than either forward in the Premier League this season. Who wants to sign \u00a330m Ipswich striker Delap?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liam Delap is the son of former Premier League midfielder Rory Delap and had spells on loan with Hull, Preston and Stoke before joining IpswichNizaar KinsellaBBC Sport football news reporterPublished9 hours ago501 CommentsIpswich striker Liam Delap will be available for \u00a330m this summer because of a relegation release clause, which will be triggered when his club inevitably returns to the Championship.The 22-year-old is likely to move on, with interest from several Premier League sides after netting 12 goals in 33 games in all competitions in his first full season in the top flight. Previously, multiple sources told BBC Sport that Delap was expected to be available for \u00a340m in the summer - with his previous club Manchester City holding a 'buy-back' fee at that price.However, sources at Ipswich have since confirmed to BBC Sport that the release clause value decreases by \u00a310m upon relegation. The Suffolk club lost 2-1 in a key relegation match against Wolves last weekend which has left them 12 points away from safety with only seven games left.Manager Kieran McKenna accepted relegation \"looks more than likely\".Delap has delivered a series of impressive performances this season and his release clause looks like good value.Paul MacDonald of FootballTransfers.com says Ipswich spent \"significantly\" above Delap's market value of \u00a36.5m last summer, which was another example of City \"extracting maximum value for their excellent youth production line\".He says the \u00a330m release clause is about right for Delap's current market value given his lack of European and senior international experience and the fact he has had one \"breakout\" season.That is, however, balanced against his age and a \"Premier League premium for English forwards\".So which clubs could make a move for him in the summer?",

You'd be forgiven for thinking we have been here before.\nBut, with another devastating innings in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday, Nicholas Pooran continued his remarkable run of form in the shortest format - a run that is threatening to rewrite the history books.\nSince the start of last year he has scored 738 more T20 runs than anyone else, is averaging 42.31, and is doing so while batting with a strike-rate of 162.49.\nBatters generally have a high strike-rate or average in T20s. Pooran is managing to achieve both.\nOnly Virat Kohli has scored more IPL runs than Nicholas Pooran since the start of the 2024 season but Pooran's strike-rate is 192.89 to Kohli's 152.61\nCondense the timeframe further and Pooran's statistics are even more remarkable. \nIn his last 10 innings he is averaging 57.7 while striking at 199, suggesting he has found the cheat code.\nHe has hit 211 sixes since the start of 2024. The next batter on the list is South African Heinrich Klaasen on 124.\nPooran, 29, broke former West Indies team-mate Chris Gayle's record for the most sixes in a calendar year last year - he hit 139 to Gayle's 135 in 2015 - and after scores of 70, 75, 44, 12 and 87 not out in this year's IPL is averaging 4.8 sixes per match this season.\nNo-one can better that in the IPL's history with Gayle's average of 3.9 per match during his peak years in 2012 the next best record.\n\"I don't plan to hit sixes,\" Pooran said earlier in the season.\n\"I just try my best to get in good positions and if it's there, just time the ball nicely.\"\nPunjab's Arya races to second century of 2025 IPL\nIPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers\nPooran is regarded as one of the world's best hitters of spin. \nOver the past two IPL seasons, playing for Lucknow Super Giants, he has scored 448 runs at an average of 89.6 and strike-rate of 184.4 against slow bowlers - again suggesting he can bat with severe aggression while not getting out.\nHe stands with a classical-looking, slightly-open stance, taps the ground once as the spinner enters his delivery stride and then thrashes the ball with his fast hands.\n\"I've never worked on my bat speed, I'm just blessed with incredible talent,\" Pooran said.\nThe Trinidadian is not afraid to dispatch pace either. His strike-rate is 173.5 against left-arm quicks and 163.5 against right-armers.\nAccording to analysts CricViz, there is not one line of pace bowling Pooran does not strike at more than 200 against at the death. \nHe strikes at more than 200 against every length except for yorkers, against which he takes down bowlers at a still-remarkable 166.\n\"He is a hard worker. No one ever sees that,\" former England all-rounder Samit Patel, who has played with Pooran at Trinbago Knight Riders and MI Emirates, told the BBC.\n\"The amount of training he does to try and hit sixes is phenomenal.\n\"His mindset is absolutely second to none and he is fully committed. There are no half-hearted swings.\n\"Having seen him train, if the ball lands in a certain area, he has trained and trained so it is natural to him [to hit sixes].\"\nSince the start of 2023, Pooran strikes at 344.7 runs per hundred balls when playing the slog sweep, 266.7 when playing a hook shot and 234.7 on the pull.\nHaving previously batted in the middle order, Lucknow Super Giants and West Indies now use Pooran as a number three.\nThe result has been him succeeding in each phase of the game - the powerplay, middle overs and the death. \nAnalysts CricViz measure a batter's performance with their 'batting impact' model and Pooran is the only player the world to have an average impact above four in all three phases since 2023.\nThe only obvious chink in Pooran's armour is against left-arm wrist-spin, against which he averages 31.5 and strikes at 108.6.\nHe does have a weakness against bouncers, but only when they are bowled in the channel just outside off stump.\nStray too wide and he averages 55.5. Get too straight with a line above the stumps and that number jumps to 126.\n\"Because he hits 360 degrees he is very difficult to bowl at,\" Patel says.\n\"From a spinners point of view, we try and make him cut the ball. We try and make him hit behind the wicket. \n\"If he hits fours it's OK. When he hits sixes we know he is dangerous.\"",

        "article_text": "A photographer's iconic shot of polar bears in abandoned buildings on a Russian island shines a spotlight on wider changes in their behaviour.\nIn September 2021, Russian wildlife photographer Dmitry Kokh and his team were sailing around the wild and remote Chukotka Peninsula in Russia's extreme northeast. They were hoping to visit Wrangel Island, a well-known gathering place for polar bears, when the weather turned.\n\"We faced a heavy storm, with super-strong wind and waves, and we tried to find a place to shelter from the storm because the boat was small,\" Kokh recalls. They sheltered near the rocky shore of a small, uninhabited island called Kolyuchin, home to an abandoned Soviet-era weather station \u2013 and made an unexpected discovery.\n\"We saw some movement on the island, took out our binoculars, and saw polar bears roaming around there, many of them, maybe 15 or 20,\" Kokh says. \"We were super surprised because we never expected to meet polar bears so far to the south. At this time of the year, they should be on the sea ice already, and on Wrangel Island, normally.\"\u00a0\nThe weather station on Kolyuchin had been abandoned in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Stepping on the island to take pictures of the bears was too dangerous. Instead, Kokh used a drone, taking his time to get the bears used to it, then slowly flying it closer. As he was watching them, he noticed something else: there were bears inside some of the houses.\n\"I realised that it was a perfect setting for photography, because these houses are super photogenic, they are old and ruined, and animals looking out of these houses, is a perfect picture,\" he says. \"And the weather was terrible, [there was] wind and rain and fog, which is also very good for photography! So everything came together.\"\u00a0\nOne of the photos captures a bear in the entrance to the weather station, and another one looking out of the window. Titled\u00a0\"House of Bears\", it won Kokh the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, given out annually by the Natural History Museum in London. \"It's the best picture I've ever taken, and I think I won't be able to repeat it, ever,\" he says.\nTom Smith, a\u00a0professor\u00a0of wildlife sciences at Brigham Young University in Utah, has spent decades conducting field work among bears, including polar bears, and says it's not unusual to see polar bears in abandoned buildings. \"They're curious animals so we see them in structures often, or they will be climbing on top of cars or pipelines,\" he explains. There has, however, been a more worrying trend across the Arctic, he says: as the sea ice melts, polar bears are increasingly approaching or wandering into inhabited towns or villages, to feed on open rubbish dumps. \"They are fatefully drawn towards human settlements,\" says Smith, and this can result in conflict with humans.\nThe problem is two-fold, according to Smith. One is that isolated, northern communities often use open rubbish pits near the village. Securing garbage so it can't be accessed, for example in bear-proof bins and enclosed landfills, is expensive, he points out \u2013 and in the past, was not necessary. \"The overwhelming Western influence in the north has resulted in [throwaway] economies that never existed there,\" he says. \"Those cultures never had a throwaway society, so the notion of having to secure garbage \u2013 that's a new thing.\"\nSecondly, Smith notes that polar bears are spending more time on land due to the climate-change-driven loss of sea ice. They are also shifting their dens from the ice onto the land, to avoid the risk of denning on the increasingly unstable sea ice, research in northern Alaska shows. Without the sea ice, the bears can't hunt for their preferred, ideal diet of blubber-rich seals, and may resort to land-based food, be it prey or rubbish.\n\"So we have a prediction that more and more bears are coming onto the land, they are increasingly hungry and drawn to these pits,\" Smith says. The rubbish pits tend to be close to the villages. \"Because of that, we can expect more and more conflict with bears,\" he warns.\nHe emphasises that polar bear attacks on humans are very rare. According to one study, across more than a century, from 1870 to 2014, there were only 73 attacks by wild polar bears on humans, distributed among the five countries with polar bears: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States. Twenty of the attacks were deadly, and 63 caused injuries. (Because the attacks often involved more than one person, the total number of deaths and injuries is higher than the number of attacks.) Smith says that humans are not part of bears' natural diet \u2013 in contrast to big cats such as tigers and lions, who do see humans as potential food. \"That is a global myth, that [polar bears] are the only bear that stalks and kills humans,\" he says.\nNevertheless, there have been cases where polar bears have attacked people, with malnourished male bears most likely to pose a threat to humans. In some cases, starving polar bears who have become used to human-provided food\u00a0may then see humans as prey, research suggests. Smith says it's the increasing proximity to humans that's the problem, rather than the bears hunting humans as such: \"The [bears] are there for the garbage, and then they will spin off into the village and of course they're quite capable of ripping doors and windows off. So we've seen an uptick in these confrontations,\" he says.\u00a0\nA 2022 research paper warns that food from human sources \u2013 especially waste \u2013 is an emerging threat to polar bears. The supply of such human-provided food including from dumps is growing, according to the paper. As a consequence, some communities in the Arctic have seen startling incursions of dozens of polar bears. The study notes that when given the choice between sea ice, and rubbish dumps on land, polar bears still prefer the sea ice \u2013 suggesting that they are resorting to the dumps out of necessity.\u00a0\nFor example, in 2019, 60 polar bears gathered at a dump near the village of Ryrkaypiy in the Chukotka region of Russia, a few 100 metres from the village, according to the study. The bears also entered the village, causing alarm, and forcing the villagers to cancel public events and keep their children at home. However, once the sea ice formed and thickened, the polar bears left the land and returned to the sea.\u00a0\nIn Novaya Zemlya, a remote Russian archipelago, a similar invasion of 52 polar bears happened in 2019, according to the study. \"Although polar bears had visited the dump in previous years, this event was unprecedented,\" the researchers note, and was likely due to the loss of sea ice. In Arviat, an Inuit community in Nunavut, Canada, the number of polar bears using the local open dump has grown each year since record keeping began in the 1960s.\u00a0\nSpending more time on land could threaten the bears' long-term survival, Smith says, as the marine diet is more suited to them. In particular, the high fat content of their preferred prey, seals, is crucial for their health. Fat, in the form of seal blubber, makes up around 70% of polar bears' natural diet on the sea ice. It contains twice the energy per gramme as muscle. In fact, when catching a seal, the bears mostly eat the blubber and leave the meat behind. To capture seals, the bears need sea ice \u2013 they stalk the seals on the ice, or wait by breathing holes in the ice for seals to appear. Over the past 50 years, as the sea ice has shrunk, the number of polar bears has fallen, studies show.\u00a0\n\"They're using [the fat from the seal] for everything: growth, maintenance, reproduction, keeping their body warm,\" says Smith. \"They just need a seal and some water and they're fine. They're unusual animals,\" he adds. They can subsist on this high-fat, seal-based diet without suffering any nutritional deficits, he says: \"It's a metabolic marvel\".\nWhen they can't access seals and instead resort to less fatty prey on land, such as Arctic birds, bird eggs, or food from dumps, the bears' health and reproduction rates decline, and they risk starvation, studies suggest. Polar bears on land lose around one kilogramme of body mass a day, research shows.\u00a0\n\"Part of the problem we have with climate change is the scale of change is so rapid,\" says Smith. There's not enough time for the highly specialised polar bears, who evolved to thrive on a diet of marine mammals, to adapt to permanently being on land again, he warns: \"We're fearful this animal can't possibly adapt back to a land-based, herbivorous diet.\" If they had to be on land constantly, \"as a species, they would die\", he says.\u00a0\nSmith and other researchers are appealing to governments to provide funding to help secure rubbish dumps near coastal villages from bears. \"It's extremely expensive. They need help. It wouldn't be asking too much to secure the garbage and make it safer for people, and for bears,\" he says. Otherwise, people confronted with growing numbers of bears in their villages may kill them to stay safe, he warns: \"It is extremely unfortunate to see bears die from such a preventable cause [as unsecured garbage].\"\nIn the town of Churchill, Canada, closing an open dump, along with other measures, decreased damage and human injury. Smith and his colleagues are also studying a range of additional steps to help communities co-exist with polar bears, such as bear spray.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The huskies that revealed the rapid shrinking of Greenland's ice\n\u2022 Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\n\u2022 The deep ocean photographer that captured a 'living fossil'\nWhile the real-life human-bear conflict is playing out, humans around the world still love seeing polar bears in pictures, the reaction to Kokh's photos suggests. In a video call, he shows a wealth of artwork and even tattoos which people made as the photos went viral.\u00a0\n\"This was an absolutely crazy time, because I got so many emails and interview requests, and many people were talking to me about these images. And they were saying something like: 'this is a post-apocalyptic picture, this is how our planet will look like if we continue to do the same things with the planet and won't change our ways',\" he says.\nFor Kokh, the award-winning photos of the polar bears opened many doors, and he has been on other expeditions to take photos of many kinds of marine wildlife. But as he reflects on that storm-swept journey to Chukotka, he comes back to the relationship between people and polar bears. For a start, even in that incredibly remote, wild region, you come across human rubbish, he says: \"What you see in this area of Russian Arctic, it's abandoned barrels, fuel barrels. It's a commonly known problem because in the Soviet Union they brought thousands of fuel barrels and abandoned them, because it was expensive to bring them back. And they still lie there, and polar bears are roaming around them.\" In the photo series of the abandoned weather station, for example, there is a shot of the bears standing in a landscape of scattered barrels.\u00a0\nBut Kokh also points out that the images can be interpreted in different ways \u2013 as a warning about our impact on the planet, but also, as testimony to the power and resilience of nature.\u00a0\n\"When I was taking the picture, I was thinking about the striking contrast between the living animals, and these destroyed buildings,\" he says, and holds up a bottle, and a cup: \"You know, all the things we make \u2013 this bottle, this cup \u2013 all the things made by humans, will be destroyed one day and will cease to exist, if we don't continue to make them. If humanity will fail, nothing will remain of us. But life will still exist.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

        "article_text": "Fifty years after Monty Python and the Holy Grail redefined comedy, stars Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam look back on the freedoms \u2013 and limitations \u2013 that shaped the film.\nAn independent British comedy made on a shoestring by a television sketch troupe? It sounds like a film destined to be forgotten within weeks of leaving cinemas \u2013 assuming it reaches cinemas in the first place. But Monty Python and the Holy Grail is still revered as one of the greatest ever big-screen comedies, 50 years on from its release in April 1975. Terry Gilliam, who co-directed the film with Terry Jones, thinks he knows why. \"Every time I watch it I'm completely bowled over by how incredibly wonderful it is,\" Gilliam tells the BBC. \"It's still so funny, and I just love everything about it.\"\nThe Monty Python team first appeared on TV together in a BBC series, Monty Python's Flying Circus, in 1969. Five of the six members \u2013 Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin \u2013 had honed their craft in student comedy societies at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The sixth, Gilliam, had moved to the UK from the US, and provided animated segments which linked their surreal sketches. In 1971, some of these sketches were reshot and compiled into a film, And Now for Something Completely Different, but the Pythons had ambitions to make a bona fide feature film \u2013 or some of them did, at least.\n\"It was by no means unanimous that we should do a film after the television series,\" says Palin. \"John, to his credit, was doing Fawlty Towers, Eric was doing Rutland Weekend Television, but the two Terrys wanted to direct a film, and I loved cinema as well, so that was the only way forward \u2013 not to make it three Python shows tacked one after the other, but to make it a full cinematic experience. No other television series had, as far as I know, leapt into cinema, but we thought we'd have a go.\"\nChapman and Jones have both died (or ceased to be, to borrow a line from one of their most beloved sketches), and Cleese and Idle were unavailable to talk to the BBC, but Gilliam and Palin reminisce cheerfully about Holy Grail \u2013 Palin quietly affable, Gilliam cackling with enthusiasm.\nPalin mentions that he and Jones had made a pre-Python series of historical sketches, The Complete and Utter History of Britain, and Jones would go on to be an acclaimed medieval historian. However, that wasn't why the team chose to build their first proper feature film around King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.\n\"We had to do something that used all six of us,\" says Palin, \"and of course the Round Table was the perfect template for that because we could each play one of the knights. And also because the Holy Grail legend was something that everyone had heard of, but nobody really knew anything about it. You could create any sort of story based around the search for a Grail.\"\nMichael Palin's Five Culture Shifters\nThe Goon Show (1951 to 1960)\nThe Goon Shows had a profound effect on me, and I know they did on John Cleese and Terry Jones. For me, they represented a moving-on from my parents' preferences for television and radio. It was just the profusion of ideas \u2013 half an hour full of strange images, weird noises, amazing sound.\nHeartbreak Hotel by Elvis Presley (1956)\nThat was a culture shifter for me, because unlike most of the pop songs I was listening to at that time, it made me think that this was something for my generation, and not the generation before.\nLady Chatterley's Lover by DH Lawrence (1928, published in 1960)\nThese are rather personal choices reflecting on my relationship with my parents. When they got a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover, it made me feel better towards them. It was a great breakthrough for me to know that they were as interested in sex as I was!\nThe Rocky Horror Show by Richard O'Brien (1973)\nJohn Cleese invited me along to see the live show in a small theatre in the King's Road. I was quite gobsmacked by this funny and outrageous celebration of the gay world \u2013 and there wasn't much of it around at that time. I remember thinking, wow, I've grown up a bit, having seen this.\nThe London Olympics opening ceremony by Danny Boyle (2012)\nIt wasn't saying \"good old Britain\" or \"imperial Britain\" or anything like that. It was about our way of life in Britain today \u2013 and done in such a creative, inventive way. To have a whole sequence about the National Health Service, instead of fireworks and pompous costumes and flags and endless marching \u2013 here was something celebratory in a way I'd never expected.\nNot that Monty Python and the Holy Grail was ever going to be a straightforward Arthurian adventure. Just as mind-bogglingly absurdist as the sketches that made the group's name, the film boasted faux-Swedish subtitles, Gilliam's instantly recognisable animation, a Trojan Rabbit, the Knights Who Say \"Ni!\", a debate about whether swallows are strong enough to carry coconuts and a modern-day historian who pops up to comment on the action before being brutally slain by a passing knight. It was, in other words, a unique proposition, which could be why the BBC chose not to invest in it. With the help of theatrical impresario Michael White, the Pythons ended up securing funds from some unusual sources, including\u00a0Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and various record companies.\nPalin: \"I say to people, 'Led Zeppelin gave us \u00a350,000 \u2013 and look where they are now.'\"\nGilliam: \"Thank God for rock'n'roll is all I can say.\"\nThe upside to this unconventional set of backers, Gilliam adds, was that the team had complete creative freedom. \"Looking back, it always seemed to me very pure, what we were doing. We were just trying to make ourselves laugh, at the same time as saying interesting things, serious things. There were no outside forces. We, the six of us, made the decisions, end of conversation, and that's a rare thing. Musicians get away with that all the time. Not many film-makers do.\"\nThe downside was that even with the Pythons' celebrity fans chipping in \"a little bit of money\", in Palin's words, the film's budget was less than \u00a3300,000 ($393,000). This wasn't much for a sweeping fantasy set in medieval Britain, so the team had to be inventive.\nThey couldn't afford to have knights riding on horseback, for instance, so King Arthur (Chapman) and his men trot along on foot, with servants behind them tapping halved coconut shells together to make the clip-clop noise of horses' hooves. Another bit of crafty problem-solving came when the team's permission to shoot at several Scottish castles was rescinded at the last minute. Instead, they simply shot Doune Castle near Stirling, Scotland from numerous different angles so that it appeared to be a different castle each time.\n\"What I love is that Doune Castle has reaped the benefit,\" says Palin. \"It's now the centre of a sort of Python tourist industry, and it's the only castle gift shop to sell ready-cut coconut shells.\"\nDespite its limited budget, one key reason why the film has lasted is that it looks like an authentic period epic, complete with atmospheric footage shot on location in Scotland. \"We were frustrated by the television shows because they had rather bad sets and bad lighting and bad everything,\" says Gilliam of himself and Jones, \"and both of us were big fans of Bruegel as a painter and Pasolini as a film-maker. We wanted all of those textures, all of that reality. I think that's what is totally unique about the film: some of the film-makers were serious historians and real film directors.\"\nNot all of the Pythons saw the necessity of those Bruegel-and-Pasolini-like textures, though. \"One of the joys of the film was looking for locations, places that had history, and trying to make them beautiful,\" says Gilliam. \"But there were days when I got in fights with the rest of the team, who had no interest in creating the times and making it real.\"\nSome members of the group were \"constantly moaning\" about shooting outdoors, especially when the Scottish rain waterlogged their heavy woollen tunics, Gilliam says. \"Mike was fine, Terry was fine, but the others just hated wearing uncomfortable costumes. They just wanted to be funny. But I said, 'You're missing the point. To be funny you've got to be real first. All this has got to be genuine.' I just thought the humour would be much, much funnier if we could ground it in reality.\"\nUltimately, the two Terrys got their way, and, as Gilliam and Palin agree, Chapman's commitment to the reality of a proud but peeved King Arthur contrasted perfectly with the silliness around him. \"Everything about him was totally believable,\" says Gilliam.\nThe only trouble with this naturalistic approach to the Middle Ages was that it came to be associated in viewers\u2019 minds with Monty Python, Gilliam says. That meant that any other films with a similar aesthetic \u2013 mud, smoke, grey weather, crumbling castles \u2013 could seem Pythonesque, however earnest they were attempting to be. Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac was released in the UK in August 1975, remembers Gilliam. \"It was deadly serious. And people started laughing because it was such a serious attempt to do the real thing, and it wasn't as good as what we were doing.\"\nHoly Grail had profound effects on the Pythons themselves, too. The success of the film convinced Gilliam that he wasn't just an animator, but a director, \"because the credits said that\", and it boosted the team's international profile, \"expanding our control over humanity\".\nIt also prompted Monty Python to make a follow-up. \"There was a feeling even after we'd done The Holy Grail of 'OK, we've done this film, bit of an experiment, but even if it works, we've all got other things to do,'\" says Palin. \"But as we did the publicity around the world, we spent a lot of time in airports, and the idea that became The Life of Brian was born in one of these bored discussions while waiting for a flight to Dublin or somewhere. Eric came up with the title, Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory, and that steered us towards the Bible story, and it meant that we were all prepared to give time to writing another film \u2013 and that was very much on the borderline. It might just have been one film, and that was that.\"\nTerry Gilliam's Five Culture Shifters\nRosa Parks' protest (1955)\nWhat a lady. What's so interesting is that the right person in the right place does something, and suddenly normal people who don't normally pay attention to things say, \"Why is this woman not able to sit on the bus like a human being?\" These powerful images hopefully wake people up.\nHeartbreak Hotel by Elvis Presley (1956) and I Want to Hold Your Hand by The Beatles (1963)\nThe first time I heard I Want to Hold Your Hand was a huge shift. I was sitting in my car in a parking lot in university, and the sound just got to me. Before that it was Elvis, Heartbreak Hotel. In both cases, I was on my own, I turned on my radio, and the world changed. This was something new and special.\nThe Pill (1960)\nI was around when the pill popped up \u2013 and suddenly sex was rampant, ladies and gentlemen! But it was also wonderful how, as sex increased, love seemed to increase, too, and so we had the Summer of Love.\nContemporary politics (2025)\nI think we're now going through the biggest cultural shift I've experienced in my whole life. It has gotten very weird to see how quickly all these extreme right-wingers are blossoming.\nNot only did Holy Grail lead to two further films, Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979) and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (1983), it was adapted by Idle and John Du Prez into a long-running Broadway show, Spamalot, which won the Tony award for best musical in 2003. Both Palin and Gilliam sing the show's praises, Gilliam's one reservation being that \"it wasn't muddy enough\".\nEven more remarkably, many of the film's phrases have entered the British lexicon, and some of its characters have become archetypes: failing politicians are regularly compared to the Black Knight, who is determined to keep fighting even when his limbs have been lopped off, while Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot is brought up when someone is seen to be especially cowardly.\nThese characters are so resonant, Gilliam suggests, because even at its most ludicrous, Monty Python's humour is \"about real people with real attitudes\", adding: \"and Britain is becoming more and more like the characters in The Holy Grail!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Clueless revolutionised the high school comedy\n\u2022 Richard Linklater on his masterpiece, Boyhood\n\u2022 The 60s icon who changed style forever\nThe characters who are cited to Palin most often, he says, are the Knights Who Say \"Ni!\". \"Apparently Elvis Presley liked watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail near to the end of his life. I don't know if he was taking it in, but just the idea of Elvis Presley saying 'Ni' gives me happiness during dark times.\"\nThe film has, arguably, offered happiness to many others who watched it during dark times, too. The Pythons weren't on a quest for the secret of immortal comedy, but somehow they stumbled on that Grail. \"I just think Python was the perfect chemical balance, the six of us,\" says Gilliam. \"We're all very different, and to put those six people in the same room, and they all basically agree on what they're doing, it's an extraordinary thing. Without any one of us, it was not the same. When Graham died [in 1989], it was already changing. And with Terry [Jones] gone [in 2020]\u2026 people say, 'Wouldn't it be great for Python to get together again?' It would be pointless to get together again! It wouldn't work. It was a magical chemical balance. It was spectacular.\"\nCulture Shifters is an interview series in which high-profile creatives reflect on a work of theirs which made a big impact on the world.

        "article_text": "Chef Ruben Bond\u00ec knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church, in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving \u2013 and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bond\u00ec, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, the tradizione giudaico-romanesca (Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset of Roman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bond\u00ec, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Maurizio Fiorino)\nRuben Bond\u00ec is a Roman chef and food influencer whose cooking videos have earned him more than four million followers on social media. In 2023, he published a cookbook on Jewish Roman cuisine, Cucina con Ruben.\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes \u2013 expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy \u2013 from carciofi alla giudia (fried artichokes) to stracotto (braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing \u2013 typical [Jewish] dishes like concia di zucchine [marinated fried courgettes] and abbacchio [roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history \u2013 from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 \u2013 Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so] the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto \u2013 sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace \u2013 is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bond\u00ec's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae \u2013 the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol \u2013 Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\nDon't get your artichokes off-season\nWhile artichokes may be the undeniable star of the Roman Jewish kitchen, Bond\u00ec recommends visitors only consume the vegetable when it's in harvest. \"Avoid getting artichokes when they're off-season,\" he advises. \"You won't be served Italian artichokes, and they won't be as fresh. You should only get them when it's artichoke season, so from November-December to May.\"\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples is carciofi alla giudia \u2013 a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes like spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches in Venice, Florence and Milan. Its main restaurant \u2013 a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures \u2013 does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearby Ba'Ghetto Milky.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram: @baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institution Renato al Ghetto \u2013 where Bond\u00ec worked as a waiter in his younger days \u2013 realised it could replicate its success with street food, its\u00a0hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosette are a type of Roman bap,\" Bond\u00ec says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beef stracotto or Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chicken alla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under \u20ac12 (\u00a310).\n\"It's very good,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S. Maria del Pianto, 63, 00186\nPhone: +39 338 859 3395\nInstagram: @rosetteria_renato_al_ghetto\n\"Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,\" Ruben says. \"And for meat lovers, I recommend BellaCarne.\"\nLocated a mere block from the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, the restaurant's name itself is particularly promising \u2013 translating literally to \"Beautiful Meat\" \u2013 and its dishes definitely live up to expectations.\n\"I can especially vouch for their grilled meats,\" Bond\u00ec says, which include scottadito lamb and veal chops.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut while meat in all its forms \u2013 roast, fried, stewed and braised \u2013 is the undeniable star, it isn't the only thing worth ordering.\n\"They have an excellent vegan crostata [tart] for dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says, made with almond paste and sour cherries.\nRoman Jewish food may be humble by nature, but BellaCarne offers a decidedly refined dining experience, set in a chic, wood-panelled interior. As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.bellacarne.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 51, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 683 3104\nInstagram: \n@bellacarne/\nThe dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expressly casereccio \u2013 homestyle, homemade.\nCasalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.\n\"It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nThe restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successful Dolce Kosher bakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.\nAmong its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia. Bond\u00ec emphatically recommends Casalino's roasts, but notes that the Zarfati family tightly guards the recipe.\n\"It's a secret,\" he says.\nWebsite: https://casalinoosteriakosher.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 1e, 00186\nPhone number: +39 06 7978 1514\nInstagram: @casalino.osteriakosher/\nWhile most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together), Il Giardino Romano has adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate.\n\"It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nAs its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (\"The Roman Garden\") has a green thumb \u2013 its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which Bond\u00ec calls the restaurant's speciality.\nThe mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use \u2013 from fettuccine alle vongole (pasta with clams) to cacio e pepe to even more idiosyncratic pairings.\n\"[Il Giardino Romano] has a particularly unique dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"A ricotta crostata with artichoke.\"\nAnd if the menu does not succeed in evoking the bucolic delights of the Roman orchard, its setting certainly will \u2013 the restaurant has a small brick courtyard covered in trees and hanging ivy.\nWebsite:https://www.ilgiardinoromano.com\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia 18, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 6880 9661\nInstagram: @ristorante_il_giardino_romano/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Best for a quintessential Jewish Roman experience: Ba'GhettoLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae \u2013 the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol \u2013 Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.Don't get your artichokes off-seasonWhile artichokes may be the undeniable star of the Roman Jewish kitchen, Bond\u00ec recommends visitors only consume the vegetable when it's in harvest. \"It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,\" Bond\u00ec says.As its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (\"The Roman Garden\") has a green thumb \u2013 its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which Bond\u00ec calls the restaurant's speciality.The mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use \u2013 from fettuccine alle vongole (pasta with clams) to cacio e pepe to even more idiosyncratic pairings. Best for non-kosher, plant-forward dishes: Il Giardino RomanoWhile most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together), Il Giardino Romano has adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate. Best for meat dishes: BellaCarne\"Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,\" Ruben says.",

They were accused of trying to stir up a rebellion.\n\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, deputy leader of SPLM-IO, said at the time.\nWhile Machar's inclusion in the unity government was a key part of the agreement, other parts of it have not been implemented.\nThe key issue for many South Sudanese is the security arrangement.\nThe deal outlined how former rebel forces and government soldiers would be brought together into a unified national army made up of 83,000 troops. The remainder were supposed to be disarmed and demobilised.\nBut this has not happened and there are still lots of militias aligned to different political groups.\nThe deal also outlined the establishment, with the help of the African Union, of a court meant to try the perpetrators of the violence. But this has not been created, in part because those holding some of the top positions in government are reluctant to set up something that could see them put on trial.\nElections that were supposed to happen in 2022 have still not taken place and neither has a new constitution been drawn up.\nWhile Kiir and Machar, both in their 70s, were part of the SPLM that fought for independence, long-standing tensions exist.\nThese have been fuelled by ethnic divisions \u2013 Kiir is Dinka, while Machar is Nuer \u2013 and competing political ambitions.\nWhen Kiir sacked Machar in 2013, triggering the civil war, Machar denounced him as a \"dictator\".\nCreating further problems between the two are the repeated postponements of elections. Polls have been delayed four times, leaving Machar unable to fulfil his presidential ambitions.\nBorn in 1952, the 72-year-old was the 27th son of the chief of Ayod and Leer and was brought up in the Presbyterian Church.\nAs an undergraduate, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Khartoum and in 1984 earned a PhD in philosophy and strategic planning at the UK's Bradford University.\nHe switched sides on several occasions during the battle to secede from Sudan, as he sought to strengthen his position and that of his Nuer ethnic group. \nHe became vice-president of South Sudan at independence in 2011. Machar was sacked in 2013 and then reinstated as part of a deal in 2016, but then fled as fighting resumed.\nBorn in 1951, the 73-year-old devout Roman Catholic was the son of a cattle herder and the eighth of nine children.\nAt 17, he joined the Anyanya, one of the rebel groups that was fighting for southern independence during the First Sudanese Civil War in 1967. Sixteen years later - in the Second Sudanese Civil War - he was one of the five founding members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement.\nThe former rebel commander, who specialised in military intelligence, was seen as a moderate within the SPLM and became its leader in 2005 after the death of John Garang in a helicopter crash\nHe became president of South Sudan on independence and has remained in that position for 14 years as no elections have taken place.\nNicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, has warned the country is \"teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war\", which would devastate the nation that is still dealing with the aftermath of the last conflict.\nThere are concerns that a return to fighting could lead to \"proxy warfare in the region\", according to Daniel Akech, an analyst at the Crisis Group think-tank.\n\"South Sudan is filled with so many armed groups, they're all seeming to be gearing up for military engagement.\"\nThe war in neighbouring Sudan adds another element of instability.\nThe leaders of the members of the regional grouping Igad \u2013 including Uganda - are supposed to be the guarantors of the 2018 deal.\nUganda's President Yoweri Museveni was in Juba recently and met Kiir, but the outcome of their discussions is not known.\nUgandan troops were also deployed to the country last month. South Sudan's government said the deployment was part of a long-standing agreement with its neighbour and the soldiers are there to support the army. \nAn African Union delegation was also in the capital and, as well as talking to the president, diplomats hoped to sit down with Machar \u2013 but that did not happen. There has been not a statement from the AU in the wake of the visit.\nWestern embassies \u2013 including the US and the UK \u2013 have released statements calling for the de-escalation of tensions, but it is not clear what impact these have had.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.Read more:Is India's cheetah reintroduction effort in crisis?Cheetahs born in India 70 years after extinctionInside India's plan to bring back extinct cheetahsSeventh cheetah dies in India since reintroductionWildlifeIndia Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.Twenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.Eight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.Villages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Officials say it's not uncommon for certain staff members to offer water to big cats if they get close to the boundary of the national park to lure them back into the forest.The mum and her cubs were in the fields close to the boundary, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.",

        "article_text": "It was a typical Friday lunchtime in Beirut's southern suburb. Then, a single warning, posted in Arabic on X by a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), triggered panic and chaos in the densely populated area known as Dahieh.\n\"Urgent warning to those in the southern suburb of Beirut,\" it read. The post included a map of a residential area, marking a building in red and two nearby schools. The IDF identified the building as a Hezbollah facility, and ordered the immediate evacuation of the schools. \nAn air strike was imminent.\nWhat followed were scenes of sheer panic. Parents rushed towards the threatened area to collect their children from the schools, while residents fled in the opposite direction, visibly shaken and fearful.\n\"It was total chaos,\" recalls Ahmad Alama, the director of St Georges School, one of those highlighted on the map. \"We tried to contain the situation as much as we could, but it was crazy.\"\nThe area was soon cleared, and Israeli forces destroyed the marked building, which they said was a warehouse storing Hezbollah drones.\nThe strike, carried out two weeks ago, was the first on Dahieh \u2013 an area with a strong Hezbollah presence \u2013 since a ceasefire ending the war between Israel and Hezbollah took effect last November.\nIt came hours after two rockets were launched from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel. Israel said it intercepted one rocket, while the other fell short of the border.\nHezbollah, the Iran-backed militant and political group, denied involvement. Israel described the rocket fire as a ceasefire \"violation\", while the office of Lebanon's president, Joseph Aoun, condemned the Israeli strike as a \"violation of the agreement\".\n\"We thought the war had ended with the ceasefire,\" says Mr Alama, \"But unfortunately, we're still living it every day.\"\nDespite the ceasefire, Israel has continued near-daily strikes on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, saying it is acting to stop Hezbollah from rearming. The strikes have mainly occurred in southern Lebanon, but the recent bombings in Dahieh have sparked particular alarm.\nOn 1 April, a second Israeli strike hit the area \u2013 this time without warning \u2013 killing a Hezbollah commander and three other people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.\nMr Alama has been running St Georges School for 30 years. It serves around 1,000 children of all ages, boys and girls. Although religion is part of the curriculum for older pupils, he describes the school as secular.\nIt is also well-known in the community for its association with the Lebanese pop star and talent show judge, Ragheb Alama \u2013 Ahmad Alama's brother and the school's owner.\nThe recently destroyed building lies just metres from the school. It isn't the only nearby scene of devastation. Another building, opposite one of St Georges' gates, remains a massive pile of rubble \u2013 brought down by Israeli air strikes before the ceasefire.\nDuring the war, the schools were closed. They didn't have to deal with situations such as the one they faced. Now reopened, they are braced for the possibility of more bombing.\nThe school has devised evacuation plans, designating emergency meeting points in the basement and routes for pupils and staff to follow in case of any danger.\nThere are also new communication plans with parents to prevent a repeat of the chaos of last month's strike. Children are now routinely reminded of these procedures, with regular evacuation drills.\nStudents, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what happened, Mr Alama says.\nInitially, the school considered cutting back on extracurricular activities to make up for lost learning, but they changed their minds.\n\"We decided otherwise,\" Mr Alama says. \"Pupils shouldn't pay the price for something they aren't responsible for. We've actually ended up increasing these activities \u2013 these kids need to release some of the pressure on them.\"\nNearly five months into the ceasefire, the return of Israeli air strikes to Beirut has intensified fears of a return to all-out war.\nThe ceasefire was meant to end more than 13 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which began when Hezbollah launched attacks on Israeli military positions the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe conflict escalated in September 2024, when Israel launched a devastating air campaign across Lebanon and invaded the south of the country.\nDahieh, deserted during the war, is bustling again. Shops have reopened, hookah smokers are back at crowded cafes, and the suburb seems as busy as before, with its persistently paralysing traffic.\nBut amid these signs of normality, scenes of destruction serve as a reminder of the pounding this area endured just months ago.\nSome 346 buildings in the area were destroyed and another were 145 partly damaged by Israeli air strikes, according to a municipal official. Israel said it targeted Hezbollah facilities and weapons caches.\nIn many neighbourhoods, the rubble is still being cleared. The roar of bulldozers and jackhammers drilling into piles of debris is almost constant.\nSome of the mounds of debris have Hezbollah flags planted on top of them, while large and small portraits of Hassan Nasrallah, the former Hezbollah leader killed by Israel during the war, line the roads.\nHowever, amid the customary signs of defiance, many are now expressing a deep concern not always voiced \u2013 at least in front of cameras \u2013 by residents of Dahieh.\n\"The destruction is terrifying. I see the destroyed buildings and I cry,\" says Sawsan Hariri, the headteacher of Burj High School, also in Dahieh. \nThe school, which also sits opposite a flattened building, sustained damage from nearby strikes.\n\"It's depressing. Walking on the street, driving your car - it's all just depressing.\"\nMs Hariri used to live on the top floor of the school building with her husband and daughter, but their home has been destroyed. They now rent a flat nearby.\nBefore the war, Burj High School had around 600 pupils. Now, it has barely 100.\nMany parents are reluctant to send their children back amid the scenes of destruction and the constant buzz of machinery. Others were concerned about the health risks, with thick dust still filling the air.\nAfter the ceasefire, owners of the private school made some basic repairs at their own expense.\nHezbollah, which is banned as a terrorist organisation in many countries but in Lebanon is a political and social movement as well as a paramilitary force, has given those who lost their homes $12,000 for a year's rent and has offered to cover the costs of repairs to apartments. However, schools and other institutions have not received any aid.\nThe Lebanese government has pledged to set up a reconstruction fund, which the World Bank estimates will cost $11bn nationwide. But international donors are believed to be insisting on the disarmament of Hezbollah and political reform \u2013 conditions that appear a distant prospect.\nThough the clearing of rubble is expected to be over by the end of the year, few expect large-scale rebuilding to follow anytime soon.",

        "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.\nBut now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.\nThe White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \n\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.\nThat framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. \nSo was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?\nIt didn't take long for Trump's aides \u2013 many of the same people who said he would never back down \u2013 to fan out and celebrate the president's move.\nTrade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\".\n\"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\"\nThey were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?\nUltimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.\nEarlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. \nIn the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.\nHe insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".\n\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.\nIn the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. \nThe reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. \nIt is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.\nThat will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions.\nThe big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week \u2013 setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order \u2013 will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. \nAnd in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

Some can't say the same,\" said Onana.\nThe 29-year-old has played 93 matches since his \u00a343.8m move from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023.\nIn all club competitions, he has conceded 137 goals and kept 23 clean sheets, conceding an average of 1.47 goals per game.\nNine of those 23 clean sheets have come in the Premier League this season, the fourth highest in the league, despite United sitting 13th in the Premier League table.\nSince the start of 2023-24, only Jordan Pickford (8.7) has prevented more goals based on Opta's expected goals model in the Premier League than Manchester United's Andre Onana (7.5).\nSince moving to the Premier League, Onana has ranked second on Opta's goals prevented metric, only behind Jordan Pickford in the Premier League over the past two campaigns.\nOpta calculate that Onana has actually conceded 7.5 goals fewer than expected from the quality of shots faced; with Pickford on 8.7.\nHowever, Onana has made high profile errors, especially in last season's awful Champions League group stage exit.\nAnd in the Premier League since 2023-24, only three goalkeepers have made more errors leading to goals than Onana has (4) - Arijanet Muric with seven and Robert Sanchez and Bart Verbruggen, both with six.\nSince the 2003-04 season, Onana tops the charts for the amount of saves made per game. Onana makes 3.4 saves per 90 minutes. In comparison, De Gea made 2.8 saves per 90 minutes and Van der Sar 2.5. \nOnana does not rank as well for save percentage. Andres Lindegaard is the only goalkeeper with a lower save percentage. De Gea, Van der Sar, Tim Howard, Dean Henderson, Ben Foster, Roy Carroll and Tomasz Kuszack all rank higher.\nIn the Premier League, Onana has the lowest number of minutes per goal conceded of all Manchester United goalkeepers - conceding every 63 minutes, on average. \nLindegaard was next on the list, every 81 minutes; De Gea every 84 minutes, Peter Schmeichel every 106 minutes, Van der Sar every 117 minutes and top of the list was Carroll, who conceded every 152 minutes.\nHe is playing in a Manchester United team in the bottom half of the Premier League table. The lowest the club has ever finished is eighth, in Onana's first season.\nRed Devils head coach Ruben Amorim described the team as \"maybe the worst\" in the club's 147-year history in January.\nOnly Raimond van der Gouw ranks lower than Onana for clean sheet percentage in the Premier League for United. Ben Foster has the highest percentage at 50% - but from just 12 appearances. \nVan der Sar, Schmeichel and De Gea - the only three goalkeepers with over 100 Premier League appearances - had clean sheet percentages of 48.4%, 44.4% and 35.4%, respectively.\nHow much are Premier League referees paid?\nHow does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?\nWho decides the Match of the Day running order?\nWhy do different football competitions have different balls?\nDo you have questions for the Ask Me Anything team?

        "article_text": "From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.\nWhile much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.\nThis is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't find Rome or London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finally found its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's caused tourism upheaval \u2013 and rows with locals \u2013 in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.\nThese are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.\nPuglia saw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays \u2013 still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.\n\"The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authentic masserie\u00a0(farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,\" says California-based travel advisor and photographer Coco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. \"The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites like Alberobello make it exceptional,\" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience the Jubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events in Rome.\nTran recommends booking a table at cliff-side Osteria Sant'Anna in Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter through Lecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran says Masseria Torre Coccaro remains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves \u2013 plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.\u00a0\nBest time to visit: Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.\nPortugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation than Porto and Lisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is the Alentejo coast, which experienced its best tourism year on record in 2024.\n\"Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,\" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey \u2013 especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.\nWho picked the list?\nStacey Leasca is an award-winning travel journalist living in Lisbon, Portugal, with two decades of experience covering destinations across Europe and beyond. She served as adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Southern California and is a PhD candidate specialising in building resiliency to disinformation in journalism.\u00a0\nThe area's \"mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe\" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price of\u00a0ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.\n\u00c9vora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famed\u00a0Festas dos Santos Populares\u00a0(Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself at\u00a0Craveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm \u2013 including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.\nBest time to visit:\u00a0Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through the\u00a0Fisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.\u00a0\nAbout five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier \u2013 both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks \u2013 specifically, Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (\u00a389.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.\nHowever, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride the Glacier Express train through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel \u2013 including a seemingly endless supply of fondue \u2013 and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxurious Chedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for the Post Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.\nBest time to visit: Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.\nCap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the C\u00f4ted'Azur \u2013 an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy \u2013 and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.\nThe iconic Belles Rives hotel \u2013 Fitzgerald's home for part of the 1920s \u2013 is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. \"The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,\" says Andria Mitsakos, founder of AMPR, which represents the property.\nBeyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts the Juan-les-Pins International Jazz Festival in July, when Bastille Day celebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend the Festival International d'Art Sacr\u00e9, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as the Picasso Museum and the Chapelle Matisse.\nBest time to visit: The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.\nWhile Italy continues to grapple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery, cultural depth and fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named a European Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.\nAt just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a \"small but mighty country\", says James Montie, branch manager at Fox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, \"from Lake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave\", are a primary draw, he adds.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n\u2022 Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n\u2022 Here's how to safely visit glacier sites around the world\nIndependent travel advisor Kimberly Denison agrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds \"Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,\" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that 60% of the country's surface area is forest and it was certified as the world's first green destination in 2016.\nTo explore its glorious landscapes, hike Triglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting at Vila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.\nBest time to visit: The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.\nThe Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine \u2013 specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.\nOf the Peloponnese's three peninsulas, Mani \u2013 the rugged middle finger \u2013 stands out. \"Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani is Greece's best-kept secret,\" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. \"This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance.\" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with \"a deep-rooted history\", she adds. Stay at Pirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century tower\u00a0turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.\nElsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.\nBest time to visit: Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.\nParis had quite the 2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever; since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for the banlieues (suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.\nWhat parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel at Goway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. \"Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,\" he explains, \"but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture \u2013 there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too.\" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks to Notre Dame reopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classic H\u00f4tel du Savoir, formerly called the H\u00f4tel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and is, let's just say, tr\u00e9s chic.\nBest time to visit: Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.\nTourism to Sweden has surged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the \"coolcation\" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.\nWhile many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think granite islands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light \u2013 minus the crowds and queues of the capital.\nIt's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, with Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded the EU's Mission Label for its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in at Hotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, the Bohusl\u00e4n archipelago beckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.\nBest time to visit: June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.\nAlbania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record 11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest in lesser-known Mediterranean escapes \u2013 which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.\n\"Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,\" says Denison. \"The Unesco-listed town of Gjirokast\u00ebr, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.\"\nNew infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including the Green Coast Hotel near the Unesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. \"Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,\" Denison adds.\nWhile hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, the Accursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays like La Brisa Boutique Hotel in Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the new Marriott in the Vlora Marina (expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.\nBest time to visit: The summer months are prime time in Albania \u2013 and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.\nWant to explore even further?

        "article_text": "Jonathan Haidt's book, The Anxious Generation, sparked a global reckoning about mobile phone usage among children when it came out last year. So, I checked in with him to find out if he still thinks childhood is at risk from too much screen time.\nParents need help. I know from experience. It's really hard to get kids off their screens when all their friends are stuck on theirs. This addiction demands collective action.\nIn the days since I spoke with Haidt, there's been one thing that he said that I haven't been able to get off my mind.\u00a0\n\"I have not met one member of Gen Z who's in denial, who says, 'No, we love the phones, the phones are good for us,'\" Haidt told me. \"They all see what's happening, but they feel trapped.\"\u00a0\nSo, has anything actually changed in the year since Haidt's book? Was all the hype around mobile phones just a flash-in-the-pan moment of collective parental anxiety or did it produce the kind of action many parents are longing for?\nWatch our full conversation, here:\nBelow is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nKatty Kay: It's been a year since your book came out and caused a huge conversation. I wanted to start by getting a kind of report card of where we are on the various aspects of what you're trying to do: phones in school, age gating, social media, getting kids to have more free playtime. Who's doing well and who isn't in America on all of those issues?\u00a0\nJonathan Haidt: I knew that the book was going to be popular. What I wasn't prepared for is that this issue would spread like wildfire around the world, not just in the US. Because around the world, family life has turned into a fight over screen time. Everyone hates it. Everyone sees it.\nWhere it took off most quickly was phone-free schools, because that is something that is very easily done. It's so hard to teach to a classroom when half of them are watching short videos and playing video games. So, the teachers have hated the phones from the beginning but they were afraid, especially in America \u2013 maybe it's the same in the UK \u2013 but in America, there are a lot of parents who want to be able to communicate all the time with their child, and they think they have a right to check in on their child. And, 'What if something goes wrong? I need to be there.' So, the overparenting \u2014\nKK: That's a paradox, then, because you've got the parents who are super worried about the phones; they see what phones are doing to their kids. But they also don't want their kids to relinquish their phones when they go into school.\nJH: Hey, look, people are complicated! They contain multitudes. And I shouldn't say that everyone saw the problem, because there were a lot of parents who saw the phone as a lifeline. They see the world as very threatening and dangerous. And so, early on in this process, I thought there would be this uniquely American thing about overprotection, because we do have a lot more crime than you do in Europe or Canada.\u00a0\nBut the surprising thing, to me, as I've been studying this for a while now, is that the vast overprotection swept through all of the English-speaking countries in the '90s. So, all the English-speaking countries went through this at the same time. And now, all of them are taking action really quickly. UK and Australia, I'd say, are in the lead in terms of actually passing legislation.\nKK: Here in the United States, we've seen some battles go through Congress, but this has not happened at a national level. What I am seeing is individual states enact laws to stop kids having phones in school.\u00a0\nJH: That's right, because we don't have a functioning legislature in the United States. We have Congress. And Congress can't really do anything if anybody objects. So, from the beginning, I have not assumed we're going to get a damn bit of help from Congress. I've been focusing on the 50 US states and on the UK, Australia and the EU. If we get legislative change in those domains, we win.\nKK: Is it too early to see what the impact is in schools that ban phones? Do we have any data on that yet or is this just a supposition that they're going to do better?\u00a0\nJH: We have reports from schools that go phone-free. And I challenge people to look around for a school that went truly phone-free, not just during class time. If it's just a restriction during class time, that's not phone-free. That causes all kinds of problems. All the kids are on their phones in between classes. But truly phone-free, where you turn in phones in the morning and you get back in the evening, the reports are raves.\u00a0\nThe most common things they say are that discipline problems are down. There's just a lot less fighting, a lot less drama. Truancy is down. School is a lot more fun when you can actually talk with your friends and play with them and laugh with them. So, truancy goes down, tardiness goes down, kids arrive on time. And the most thrilling thing for me, and the most universal thing they say is we hear laughter in the hallways again. So, the reports are uniformly raves. There's often some resistance in the first week or two, but what they mostly say is \u2014\nKK: Who's the resistance from?\u00a0\nJH: Some of the kids don't like it and some of the parents don't like it. But I've spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school superintendents. What they're telling me is they expected a huge pushback from parents, but they actually didn't get it. Because this year is different. The zeitgeist has changed.\nActually, it started in the UK even before my book came out. You had smartphone-free schools; they went viral in February of last year and my book didn't come out until March. So, it's a different environment now, and schools are ready to act. Now, there are some studies, there are some academic studies that have been equivocal, but when you look at them \u2013 there was one that came out in the UK, it was published in the Lancet.\nIt said phone-free schools don't help. No, it didn't. It looked at like eight schools that had a backpack policy, which is not very good, and then like 11 or 15 schools that had a classroom-ban policy. It was like there was a slight difference in policies. These are very different schools. So, we have a Substack post showing this Lancet study doesn't show anything of the sort. There was a study in the UK done by Policy Exchange, where they looked at several hundred UK schools, and only about 10% are truly phone-free. If you look at the schools in the UK that are truly phone-free, and you compare them to the others, then you do find academic benefits and behavioural benefits.\nKK: I want to go back to something you said at the beginning about the 1990s and how that became a time of fear. I've been a working mother my whole life. I have four children: two of whom were born in the 90s, one was born in 2000, one was born in 2006. So, they've all had different experiences with screens. But from the research that I've done, something else happened in the kind of 80s and 90s, which was a sort of expansion of what we deem to be a good parent, and more specifically than that, a good mother, right? So, women were taking on full-time jobs and still doing the overwhelming share of household chores.\nBut it's not just that. In my research, women today are doing as much in the way of household chores as their great-grandmothers were in the early part of the 1900s. It's that society somehow deemed us not to be good parents if we weren't spending an enormous amount of time with our kids, spending our weekends running ragged taking them to events. And somehow you got, particularly perhaps if you were a working mother, the kind of guilt exploded. I feel like screens \u2013 and I've seen it with my own kids \u2013 screens just became a kind of form of relief for parents, and mothers in particular, from whom society was just asking impossible things.\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0Every word you said is true. I'll just try to add on to it. It is a puzzle. And I've got a really bizarre graph in the book showing that the amount of time that mothers and fathers spent parenting was fairly flat in the 80s and even into the 90s. And then all of a sudden in the mid 1990s, at least in the US, it jumped up. Something changed in the 90s. And it's the norm that you're talking about.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Great, I moved here in '96, so I just hit right at the right moment! [Laughter]\nJH:\u00a0You just hit it! That's right. So, that really did happen. Women today have fewer children than their grandmothers did, and they're working outside the home, which their grandmothers didn't, and they're spending more time with the kids. So, a lot of this has fallen on women.\u00a0\nNow, why did this happen? The best answer comes from this really wonderful book called Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi. He's a British sociologist and he's focusing on what happened in the UK, not the US, although he points out that the same things happened in the US and Canada. And what happened, he says, is we lost trust in other people. And when that happens, then we don't trust our neighbourhood. We don't trust people to send our kids out.\u00a0\nIt's always been the case that raising kids was kind of a joint project. When you lose that, now every family is on their own. And that means it's mostly the mothers who are on their own.\nKK:\u00a0In your sort of meta analysis of screens and kids and schools, and whether we can have phones in schools, is it actually the case that we have to address those issues before we can really wean our kids off this screen addiction?\nJH:\u00a0We have to understand those issues first if we want to fully understand what happened historically. But I would not say that we have to address those issues first, because, frankly, we're not going to address them. I mean reversing the decline of community, you know, I go to all kinds of meetings about that. There are all kinds of foundations. But look, technology changes society \u2014\nKK:\u00a0Can you just fix it all, Jon? [Laughter] I mean, I know you've done phones in schools, but really, step it up!\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0[Laughter] Yeah. Let's fix community next! So, no, we're not going to restore trust in our neighbours such that we can let our kids out. That's not going to happen. In fact, it's likely to get a lot worse as we go into the\u00a0era of AI, when we have no idea what's true. We're never going to know what's true again for a very long time, if ever. So, rather, we have to adapt to this. And I think the way we adapt to this onslaught of technology is by saying, \"Okay, you know what? Kids are not adults.\"\nWe have to focus on what it will take to allow kids to have healthy brain development through puberty. That's my mission. We've got to give kids a lot less screen time. A lot less fragmenting time. No TikTok. No short videos. That's the worst, and give them a lot more experience interacting with people.\nKK:\u00a0What do you say to poorer families where both parents have to work multiple jobs and for whom the invention of screen content that occupies their small children is just literally a lifesaver for them? Is there a different argument there or not?\nJH:\u00a0Yes, there is. So, the way to understand this is that in the 90s, when we were all techno-optimists, the internet was amazing. The early internet was amazing. And rich kids had computers and internet access and poor kids didn't. And so in the 1990s, we had a big thing, you know, it was educational equity.\u00a0Bill Gates, all kinds of philanthropists donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Let's get every kid a computer.\nSo, in the early 2000s, we're all techno-optimists and we think, 'Well, okay, I don't trust my kid to walk three blocks to a store, but he's on a computer. What could happen? He's learning! That's great!' We think it's good that our kids are upstairs on a computer. And, of course, this is one of the central ideas in the\u00a0Netflix show Adolescence\u00a0is, you know, parents think their kids are safe when they're on a computer. And in the 90s, they mostly were. There was some bad stuff, too, but they mostly were.\u00a0\nBut once the internet gets taken over, or at least once childhood gets\u00a0owned by three or four big companies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0TikTok, Snap, Meta and Google \u2013 once childhood is owned by these companies that are using algorithms to send them content, to keep them hooked, this is when things get much darker. Kids on computers now, they're not learning to program. They're not learning any useful skills. They're just basically lying there consuming content. And this is when it gets really sick and really dark.\nEditorial Note:\nTikTok told the BBC's Marianna Spring it has \"industry-leading\" safety settings for teens, and Meta cites its own tools for \"positive and age-appropriate experiences\". Read more about how social media companies address concerns of children's safety online, here.\nBut we don't quite realise that. And so what's happened now is the educational equity issue has reversed. It used to be \"get poor kids computers\". But by the 2000s, what was clear was that the rich people, and especially the people in Silicon Valley, don't let their kids have this stuff. So, now the great educational equity imperative is we've got to give the poor kids the same protections that the rich kids have. We've got to get them less time on screens. You said it's literally a lifesaver. I would say no, it's not literally a lifesaver. It literally is a brain-scrambler.\nKK: A lot of what you write about and the way you write is targeted at adults. If you were to go into schools and talk to middle school children, what would be the most effective argument you could make to them?\nJH: I'm glad you asked that, because just before our conversation, I was in an hour-long conversation with my team. We're creating a version of The Anxious Generation for 8-to-12 year olds, for kids who don't yet have a smartphone. And the main thing that we want to convey to them is that there are these companies that are going to try to hook you. And they've hooked most kids. If you look at the kids older than you, they're not having fun. They're lonely, they're sad. Because they all got sucked into just being content consumers, that's all they do. But do you want to have an amazing, exciting life? Do you want to do things? Do you want to have fun with your friends?\nDon't go down that route. Don't let these companies trick you and suck you in. One of the key ideas in The Anxious Generation is this is not a book about screens; this is a book about childhood. What kind of childhood do we want for our kids?\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.\nHVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.\nBut industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.\nAnd data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.\nEurope used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.\nIn response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".\nHVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.\nUK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.\nIts green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.\nBut industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.\nThat would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.\nThis palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.\nThey said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.\nAnother whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.\n\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.\n\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"\nAs well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce. \nThe figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.\nEU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.\nBut the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.\nThis mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.\n\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".\n\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.\n\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"\nUnderpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.\nIt is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.\nBut in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.\n\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.\n\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"\nThis concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.\nConstruction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.\n\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.\nThe European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.\nIn a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".\nIn the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.\nThe BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.\nIt would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.\nIn response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".\n\"The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,\" it said.\nSign up for our

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.\nExperts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.\nPassengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.\nThe digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.\nLying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.\nThis would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.\nAll died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.\n\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"\nA new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.\nIt takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.\n\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.\nThe simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.\nTitanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. \nBut the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.\n\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.\n\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"\nUnfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.\nThe human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.\nPersonal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.\nThe scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.\n\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\"",

The next batter on the list is South African Heinrich Klaasen on 124.\nPooran, 29, broke former West Indies team-mate Chris Gayle's record for the most sixes in a calendar year last year - he hit 139 to Gayle's 135 in 2015 - and after scores of 70, 75, 44, 12 and 87 not out in this year's IPL is averaging 4.8 sixes per match this season.\nNo-one can better that in the IPL's history with Gayle's average of 3.9 per match during his peak years in 2012 the next best record.\n\"I don't plan to hit sixes,\" Pooran said earlier in the season.\n\"I just try my best to get in good positions and if it's there, just time the ball nicely.\"\nPunjab's Arya races to second century of 2025 IPL\nIPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers\nPooran is regarded as one of the world's best hitters of spin. \nOver the past two IPL seasons, playing for Lucknow Super Giants, he has scored 448 runs at an average of 89.6 and strike-rate of 184.4 against slow bowlers - again suggesting he can bat with severe aggression while not getting out.\nHe stands with a classical-looking, slightly-open stance, taps the ground once as the spinner enters his delivery stride and then thrashes the ball with his fast hands.\n\"I've never worked on my bat speed, I'm just blessed with incredible talent,\" Pooran said.\nThe Trinidadian is not afraid to dispatch pace either. His strike-rate is 173.5 against left-arm quicks and 163.5 against right-armers.\nAccording to analysts CricViz, there is not one line of pace bowling Pooran does not strike at more than 200 against at the death. \nHe strikes at more than 200 against every length except for yorkers, against which he takes down bowlers at a still-remarkable 166.\n\"He is a hard worker. No one ever sees that,\" former England all-rounder Samit Patel, who has played with Pooran at Trinbago Knight Riders and MI Emirates, told the BBC.\n\"The amount of training he does to try and hit sixes is phenomenal.\n\"His mindset is absolutely second to none and he is fully committed. There are no half-hearted swings.\n\"Having seen him train, if the ball lands in a certain area, he has trained and trained so it is natural to him [to hit sixes].\"\nSince the start of 2023, Pooran strikes at 344.7 runs per hundred balls when playing the slog sweep, 266.7 when playing a hook shot and 234.7 on the pull.\nHaving previously batted in the middle order, Lucknow Super Giants and West Indies now use Pooran as a number three.\nThe result has been him succeeding in each phase of the game - the powerplay, middle overs and the death. \nAnalysts CricViz measure a batter's performance with their 'batting impact' model and Pooran is the only player the world to have an average impact above four in all three phases since 2023.\nThe only obvious chink in Pooran's armour is against left-arm wrist-spin, against which he averages 31.5 and strikes at 108.6.\nHe does have a weakness against bouncers, but only when they are bowled in the channel just outside off stump.\nStray too wide and he averages 55.5. Get too straight with a line above the stumps and that number jumps to 126.\n\"Because he hits 360 degrees he is very difficult to bowl at,\" Patel says.\n\"From a spinners point of view, we try and make him cut the ball. We try and make him hit behind the wicket. \n\"If he hits fours it's OK. When he hits sixes we know he is dangerous.\"",

The next batter on the list is South African Heinrich Klaasen on 124.\nPooran, 29, broke former West Indies team-mate Chris Gayle's record for the most sixes in a calendar year last year - he hit 139 to Gayle's 135 in 2015 - and after scores of 70, 75, 44, 12 and 87 not out in this year's IPL is averaging 4.8 sixes per match this season.\nNo-one can better that in the IPL's history with Gayle's average of 3.9 per match during his peak years in 2012 the next best record.\n\"I don't plan to hit sixes,\" Pooran said earlier in the season.\n\"I just try my best to get in good positions and if it's there, just time the ball nicely.\"\nPunjab's Arya races to second century of 2025 IPL\nIPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers\nPooran is regarded as one of the world's best hitters of spin. \nOver the past two IPL seasons, playing for Lucknow Super Giants, he has scored 448 runs at an average of 89.6 and strike-rate of 184.4 against slow bowlers - again suggesting he can bat with severe aggression while not getting out.\nHe stands with a classical-looking, slightly-open stance, taps the ground once as the spinner enters his delivery stride and then thrashes the ball with his fast hands.\n\"I've never worked on my bat speed, I'm just blessed with incredible talent,\" Pooran said.\nThe Trinidadian is not afraid to dispatch pace either. His strike-rate is 173.5 against left-arm quicks and 163.5 against right-armers.\nAccording to analysts CricViz, there is not one line of pace bowling Pooran does not strike at more than 200 against at the death. \nHe strikes at more than 200 against every length except for yorkers, against which he takes down bowlers at a still-remarkable 166.\n\"He is a hard worker. No one ever sees that,\" former England all-rounder Samit Patel, who has played with Pooran at Trinbago Knight Riders and MI Emirates, told the BBC.\n\"The amount of training he does to try and hit sixes is phenomenal.\n\"His mindset is absolutely second to none and he is fully committed. There are no half-hearted swings.\n\"Having seen him train, if the ball lands in a certain area, he has trained and trained so it is natural to him [to hit sixes].\"\nSince the start of 2023, Pooran strikes at 344.7 runs per hundred balls when playing the slog sweep, 266.7 when playing a hook shot and 234.7 on the pull.\nHaving previously batted in the middle order, Lucknow Super Giants and West Indies now use Pooran as a number three.\nThe result has been him succeeding in each phase of the game - the powerplay, middle overs and the death. \nAnalysts CricViz measure a batter's performance with their 'batting impact' model and Pooran is the only player the world to have an average impact above four in all three phases since 2023.\nThe only obvious chink in Pooran's armour is against left-arm wrist-spin, against which he averages 31.5 and strikes at 108.6.\nHe does have a weakness against bouncers, but only when they are bowled in the channel just outside off stump.\nStray too wide and he averages 55.5. Get too straight with a line above the stumps and that number jumps to 126.\n\"Because he hits 360 degrees he is very difficult to bowl at,\" Patel says.\n\"From a spinners point of view, we try and make him cut the ball. We try and make him hit behind the wicket. \n\"If he hits fours it's OK. When he hits sixes we know he is dangerous.\"",

        "article_text": "It's having a moment with celebrities, fashionistas and Gen Z. But wearing any kind of fur, from vintage to synthetic, poses some difficult questions. Could a new plant-based faux fur be the way forward?\nFrom Tory Burch in New York and Simone Rocha in London, to Fendi in Milan and Miu Miu in Paris, fur dominated the autumn/winter 2025-26 catwalks. And celebrities matched the runways, with Hailey Bieber, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift and Rihanna all spending the start of the year wrapped up in faux and vintage fur coats.\nThe last time fur hit the headlines was in 2017, when Gucci pledged to go fur-free, influencing a host of designer brands to follow suit. The move was welcomed by animal rights campaigners, but what followed was the scaling of a new problem: much of the real fur has been replaced by synthetic alternatives that are derived from fossil fuels. Given the tensions around animal welfare and the environment, why is fur now firmly back in fashion?\nIt began in early 2024 with the arrival of the mob wife aesthetic, an ostentatious, glamorous response to the understated, minimalist trend that preceded it: stealth wealth. \"Reviving historical looks for contemporary wear is a natural part of the fashion cycle. It's escapism, and who doesn't want some of that?\" says Natascha Radclyffe-Thomas, associate professor, MBA fashion business and entrepreneurship, at Ravensbourne University, London. \"I was in the room when [former CEO] Marco Bizzarri announced Gucci would no longer use animal fur in its collections, and remember what an amazing shift this was for an Italian luxury brand where fur was such a prevalent material. But the topic of faux fur is such a tricky one, too.\"\nRadclyffe-Thomas adds that, since designer labels' decision to ban real fur from their collections, the faux-fur market has evolved from the early days of \"fun\" fur \u2013 low cost, often in bright colours that didn't attempt to imitate the real thing \u2013 to a new level of quality where most consumers wouldn't know the difference between real and fake.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe production of fossil fuel-based fabrics continues to rise globally, with polyester the most common, accounting for 57% of all fibre production. Even clothing made from recycled polyester is problematic because the model isn't circular. The vast majority is made using plastic bottles \u2013\u00a0 not old textiles \u2013 which means that it can't be recycled again, and will most likely end up in landfill at some point.\nOne way to keep faux fur out of landfill \u2013\u00a0 or delay its final destination \u2013 is to keep it in circulation. At fashion rental company By Rotation, the rental of faux fur and wool coats has been increasing since even before the recent catwalk shows. London label Charlotte Simone \u2013\u00a0 whose faux fur coats have been worn by Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa and Madonna \u2013 is the third most rented brand across coats and jackets. \"Higher quality, well-made faux fur, especially from designer brands, tends to last longer, meaning it's more likely to be passed down, resold or rented rather than discarded,\" By Rotation founder and CEO, Eshita Kabra-Davies, tells the BBC.\nThe global second hand clothing market is expected to reach $367bn by 2029, with a record number of shoppers having bought pre-loved clothes in 2024. This year, since the autumn/winter 2025-26 collections were shown, searches for both real and faux fur have spiked at rental platforms and online retailers.\u00a0\nHolly Watkins, owner of vintage boutique One Scoop Store in north London, says that in the past few years she has seen a considerable shift away from selling real fur to fake alternatives, in response to changing tastes and demands from her customers. \"I only sell real fur if it's a super-special vintage piece which I can't say no to, or has a detachable collar or trim,\" she tells the BBC. \"Personally, I don't have a problem with old [real] fur \u2013 it's better to prolong its life than send it to landfill. I have more of a problem with polyester, in that it will never biodegrade.\"\nBut from conversations with vintage dealers in west London\u00a0\u2013 home to the likes of Portobello market \u2013 Watkins says that many stores have never stopped selling real fur, both old and new, with younger shoppers helping to drive the trend.\u00a0\n\"Fashion turned on fur. Young customers want more\" was the headline of a recent Wall Street Journal article \u2013 and the consensus does seem to be that Gen Z is leading the revival of vintage fur. Madison Avenue Furs, the largest buyer of pre-owned fur in the US, reports a significant uplift in sales, particularly of pre-owned pieces. \"We saw college students coming in to buy fur, which we haven't seen in years,\" Larry Cowit, owner of Madison Avenue Furs, tells the BBC. \"The vintage furs against the new furs was a concern for many of the younger buyers and \u2013 ethically \u2013 they were comfortable with vintage.\"\nCustomers are buying vintage furs across the board, says Cowit, including mink, fox and beaver in oversized silhouettes \u2013 from the likes of Christian Dior, Fendi, Oscar de la Renta, Prada and YSL. \"Once these brands come in, they go rather quickly.\"\nOn the catwalks at the recent fashion weeks, much of the fur was faux, although among the headlines at Paris Fashion Week was a mink coat made from real vintage fur at Gabriela Hearst, a designer label that positions itself as \"luxury with a conscience\".\nAnimal rights campaigners don't accept the vintage argument. \"Regardless of when the damage was done, vintage fur remains clothing made from the skin of a needlessly killed and caged animal,\" says Emma H\u00e5kansson, founder of Collective Fashion Justice. \"It is an ongoing symbol of human supremacy over other animals, and we should not accept that in the 21st Century when we have myriad other options without animal exploitation, wildlife killing or factory farming.\"\nAmong the new-generation alternatives to fossil-fuel-made fur and real animal skin is Savian, a 100% plant-based fur made from nettle, flax and hemp sourced from Europe and produced in Italy. Developed by material science company BioFluff, Savian launched in the form of a longline coat by Stella McCartney during COP28 in November 2023, and was later used in 2024 by Danish fashion brand Ganni to create a collection of bags for Copenhagen Fashion Week.\n\"We are working with several fashion brands across the luxury, contemporary and accessible markets to develop materials that are suited to their needs,\" BioFluff co-founder Roni Gamzon tells the BBC, adding that cost remains a challenge to scaling up the adoption of new-gen materials. \"So many brands have built a reliance on low-cost synthetic materials manufactured at mass in the Far East, making it impossible for us to compete purely on pricing.\"\nBioFluff is part of La Maison des Startups, a programme from LVMH to help accelerate the implementation of new solutions within its portfolio of brands, which includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and C\u00e9line. Conversely, LVMH also helps to fund The International Fur Federation, paying \u20ac300,000 ($318,000) for Furmark membership, a global certification and traceability system for real fur.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Ten items in your wardrobe is enough \u2013 here's why\n\u2022 The Indigenous-American supermodel bringing change\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\nThe argument that synthetic fur has a higher environmental impact than real fur is questioned by a 2013 scientific study, which compared the impact of natural mink fur coats against that of faux fur coats, and found that the production of natural mink fur had the highest climate impact. When this study is considered alongside two other facts \u2013 approximately 100 million animals are killed for their fur and more than 100 billion items of clothing are produced globally each year (with 65% ending up in landfill within 12 months) \u2013 is the production of new fur clothing ever justified?\nCowit, who continues to sell both new and vintage furs, believes it's up to customers to make the choice, while Radclyffe-Thomas says her anti-real-fur views were challenged when she worked in the US and met people for whom hunting and trapping were part of their traditions.\n\"For many Indigenous cultures, fur and animal skins are part of a cultural heritage used for ceremonial and everyday dress, and I do think that there is an argument for respecting this,\" she says, before recalling her early student days where she learnt sewing techniques from a furrier. \"Those classes brought home to me the reality of the number of animals killed for clothing, and pretty much cemented my personal view: I have never considered buying real fur.\"\nThree Things to Help Heal the Planet by Ana Santi is published by Welbeck Balance.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Suddenly, Donald Trump's trade war is in much sharper focus.\nRather than a fight on all fronts against the world, this now looks far more like a fight on familiar Trumpian territory: America v China.\nThe 90-day pause on the higher \"retaliatory\" tariffs levied on dozens of countries still leaves a universal across-the-board tariff of 10% in place.\nBut China \u2013 which ships everything from iPhones to children's toys and accounts for around 14% of all US imports \u2013 has been singled out for much harsher treatment with an eye-watering rate of 125%.\nTrump said the increase was due to Beijing's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods, a move the president described as showing a \"lack of respect\".\nBut for a politician who first fought his way to the White House on the back of an anti-China message, there is much more to this than simple retaliation.\nFor Trump, this is about the unfinished business of that first term in office.\n\"We didn't have the time to do the right thing, which we're doing now,\" he told reporters.\nThe aim is nothing less than the upending of an established system of global trade centred on China as the factory of the world, as well as the once widely held view that underpinned it \u2013 the idea that more of this trade was, in and of itself, a good thing.\nTo understand just how central this is to the US president's thinking, you need to go back to the time before anyone ever thought of him as a possible candidate for office, let alone a likely winner.\nIn 2012, when I first reported from Shanghai - China's business capital - increased trade with the country was seen by almost everyone \u2013 global business leaders, Chinese officials, visiting foreign governments and trade delegations, foreign correspondents and learned economists \u2013 as a no brainer.\nIt was boosting global growth, providing an endless supply of cheap goods, enriching China's army of new factory workers increasingly embedded in global supply chains, and providing lucrative opportunities to multinational corporations selling their wares to its newly minted middle classes.\nWithin a few of years of my arrival, China had surpassed the US to become the world's biggest market for Rolls Royce, General Motors and Volkswagen.\nThere was a deeper justification, too.\nAs China got richer, so the theory went, Chinese people would begin to demand political reform.\nTheir spending habits would also help China transition to a consumer society.\nBut the first of those aspirations never happened, with China's ruling Communist Party only tightening its grip on power.\nAnd the second one didn't happen fast enough, with China not only still dependent on exports, but openly planning to become ever more dominant.\nIts infamous policy blueprint - published in 2015 and entitled Made in China 2025 - set out a huge state-backed vision of becoming a global leader in a number of key manufacturing sectors, from aerospace to ship building to electric vehicles.\nAnd so it was that same year, a political outsider launched his run for US president, making the case repeatedly on the campaign trail that China's rise had hollowed out the American economy, driven Rust Belt decline and cost blue-collar workers their livelihoods and dignity.\nTrump's first-term trade war broke the mould and shattered the consensus. His successor, President Joe Biden, kept much of his tariffs on China in place.\nAnd yet, even though they have undoubtedly caused China some pain, they have not done much to change the economic model.\nChina now produces 60% of the world's electric cars \u2013 a large proportion of them made by its own homegrown brands - and 80% of the batteries that power them.\nSo, now Trump is back, with this tit-for-tat escalation on levies.\nIt would, arguably, be the biggest shock ever delivered to the established global trading system, were it not for all the other on-again off-again tariff measures the US president has rolled out in recent days.\nWhat happens next depends on two key questions.\nFirstly, whether China takes up that offer to negotiate.\nAnd secondly, assuming it eventually does, whether China is willing to make the kind of major concessions that America is looking for, including a complete overhaul of its export driven economic model.\nIn answering them, the first thing to say is that we are in completely uncharted territory, so we should be wary of anyone who says they know how Beijing is likely to react.\nBut there are certainly reasons to be cautious.\nChina's vision of its economic strength - one based on strong exports and a tightly protected domestic market - is now closely bound up with its idea of national rejuvenation and the supremacy of its one-party system.\nIts tight control over the information sphere means it will be unlikely to drop its barriers to American technology companies, for example.\nBut there is a third question, and it is one for America to answer.\nDoes the US still believe in free trade?

        "summary": "Why Trump is hitting China on trade - and what might happen next1 day agoShareSaveJohn SudworthSenior North America correspondentShareSaveWatch: Trump says he would consider meeting with China\u2019s Xi Jinping on tariffsSuddenly, Donald Trump's trade war is in much sharper focus.Rather than a fight on all fronts against the world, this now looks far more like a fight on familiar Trumpian territory: America v China.The 90-day pause on the higher \"retaliatory\" tariffs levied on dozens of countries still leaves a universal across-the-board tariff of 10% in place.But China \u2013 which ships everything from iPhones to children's toys and accounts for around 14% of all US imports \u2013 has been singled out for much harsher treatment with an eye-watering rate of 125%.Trump said the increase was due to Beijing's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods, a move the president described as showing a \"lack of respect\".But for a politician who first fought his way to the White House on the back of an anti-China message, there is much more to this than simple retaliation.For Trump, this is about the unfinished business of that first term in office.\"We didn't have the time to do the right thing, which we're doing now,\" he told reporters.The aim is nothing less than the upending of an established system of global trade centred on China as the factory of the world, as well as the once widely held view that underpinned it \u2013 the idea that more of this trade was, in and of itself, a good thing.ReutersChina now produces 60% of the world's electric cars \u2013 a large proportion of them made by its own homegrown brandsTo understand just how central this is to the US president's thinking, you need to go back to the time before anyone ever thought of him as a possible candidate for office, let alone a likely winner.In 2012, when I first reported from Shanghai - China's business capital - increased trade with the country was seen by almost everyone \u2013 global business leaders, Chinese officials, visiting foreign governments and trade delegations, foreign correspondents and learned economists \u2013 as a no brainer.It was boosting global growth, providing an endless supply of cheap goods, enriching China's army of new factory workers increasingly embedded in global supply chains, and providing lucrative opportunities to multinational corporations selling their wares to its newly minted middle classes.Within a few of years of my arrival, China had surpassed the US to become the world's biggest market for Rolls Royce, General Motors and Volkswagen.What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?US pauses higher tariffs for most countries but hits China harderTrump steps back from cliff edge of all-out global trade war There was a deeper justification, too.As China got richer, so the theory went, Chinese people would begin to demand political reform.Their spending habits would also help China transition to a consumer society.But the first of those aspirations never happened, with China's ruling Communist Party only tightening its grip on power.And the second one didn't happen fast enough, with China not only still dependent on exports, but openly planning to become ever more dominant.Its infamous policy blueprint - published in 2015 and entitled Made in China 2025 - set out a huge state-backed vision of becoming a global leader in a number of key manufacturing sectors, from aerospace to ship building to electric vehicles.And so it was that same year, a political outsider launched his run for US president, making the case repeatedly on the campaign trail that China's rise had hollowed out the American economy, driven Rust Belt decline and cost blue-collar workers their livelihoods and dignity.Trump's first-term trade war broke the mould and shattered the consensus. His successor, President Joe Biden, kept much of his tariffs on China in place.And yet, even though they have undoubtedly caused China some pain, they have not done much to change the economic model.China now produces 60% of the world's electric cars \u2013 a large proportion of them made by its own homegrown brands - and 80% of the batteries that power them.So, now Trump is back, with this tit-for-tat escalation on levies.It would, arguably, be the biggest shock ever delivered to the established global trading system, were it not for all the other on-again off-again tariff measures the US president has rolled out in recent days.Watch: Why US markets skyrocketed after Trump tariffs pauseWhat happens next depends on two key questions.Firstly, whether China takes up that offer to negotiate.And secondly, assuming it eventually does, whether China is willing to make the kind of major concessions that America is looking for, including a complete overhaul of its export driven economic model.In answering them, the first thing to say is that we are in completely uncharted territory, so we should be wary of anyone who says they know how Beijing is likely to react.But there are certainly reasons to be cautious.China's vision of its economic strength - one based on strong exports and a tightly protected domestic market - is now closely bound up with its idea of national rejuvenation and the supremacy of its one-party system.Its tight control over the information sphere means it will be unlikely to drop its barriers to American technology companies, for example.But there is a third question, and it is one for America to answer.Does the US still believe in free trade? Donald Trump often suggests that tariffs are a good thing, not merely as a means to an end, but as an end in themselves.He talks about the benefit of a protectionist barrier for America, in order to stimulate domestic investment, encourage American companies to bring those foreign supply chains back home, and raise tax revenues.And if Beijing believes that is indeed the primary purpose of the tariffs, it may decide there is nothing to negotiate anyway.Rather than championing the idea of economic co-operation, the world's two biggest superpowers may find themselves locked in a fight for winner-takes-all economic supremacy.If so, that really would mark a shattering of the old consensus, and a very different, possibly very dangerous, future.Watch: China tariffs 'not good' for the economy - US shoppersXi JinpingTrump tariffsChinaDonald TrumpUnited States",

There is so much talent over here. The joy and passion in the way of expressing ourselves on the field shouldn't be limited.\n\"I really wonder what the board of the CBF looks like.

That is when there is expectation to win. That is when the fans are on you. There are 20 minutes to go, it's 0-0 or you are getting beaten. The pressure is heaped on you. Have you got it in you to stand up and be counted?\nThat is what makes or breaks a Rangers player. And, in this squad, there are not enough players with the mentality to get through those periods. That for me is where this squad is at - and that is the aspect that has let them down.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\nThis video can not be played\nSaturday's loss to Hibernian set an unwanted Rangers record of five straight home defeats\nThat is separate to the technical attributes of these players, though. They are good footballers. They have shown that in European games. They have shown that against Celtic. \nIt was only last month they knocked Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce out of the Europa League and went to Celtic Park and won for the first time in years.\nBut those games bring a different pressure. They bring a different expectation. Going into big European games, especially in the knockout rounds, rarely is there expectancy on Rangers to win.\nMeanwhile, domestically, they simply need to win, win, win. Their tempo needs to be high. They need to commit more bodies forward. \nHow many times have you watched a Rangers game where their two centre-halves are in the attacking half against one striker? That is because, in basic terms, they have to commit more in an attacking sense.\nBut you are at risk if you lose the ball. Just look at Hibernian's second goal on Saturday. It comes from a point where Rangers' defensive-minded players are in Hibs' half.\nIn Europe, you will rarely see that situation with a Rangers team, because they have more focus on the defensive side of their game.\nThe easier thing to do in football is be a defensive team. That is what I think this Rangers team are more comfortable doing. They feel more at ease playing in a defensively organised team that can then counter-attack. \nWhy is it easier? Well, in those moments, you are not coaching a set pattern to break a team down. When that is your gameplan, inevitably when you get possession, the opposition are not set up to be broken down. \nThese Rangers players are intelligent footballers. They get the gameplan of stopping the opposition and being clinical on the counter. They have shown that under Barry Ferguson away to Fenerbahce and Celtic playing in a 3-4-3 set-up.\nIn those games, when Rangers have won the ball, they have been in positions to score goals because even when they are sitting deep in a defensive formation, they always have three attackers forward.\nDefensively, they have more players deeper in the pitch and enough bodies to defend. And, in the attacking sense, having one striker and two number 10s means it is not just Cyriel Dessers or Vaclav Cerny running forward themselves.\nRangers' average player positions in last month's 3-1 win at Fenerbahce (left) and Saturday's defeat at home to Hibs (right) show a stark contrast between where their defensive line typically sits in European and domestic games\nThat approach did not work so well in the home leg against Fenerbahce, or the first half of their league game at Dundee, when they were perhaps expected to take the game to the opposition.\nBut for Thursday's encounter with Athletic Bilbao, I feel the first leg being at home should suit Rangers.\nMost European games that are two-legged affairs, particular in the latter stages of competitions, the first leg is always more cagey. It will probably be accepted a bit more by the Ibrox crowd if Rangers are a bit more solid. \nRangers would bite your hand off to go into that second leg in Bilbao at 0-0. But, make no mistake about it, this will be their toughest European game to date this season. \nThey are going to face a seriously technical team who are fourth in Spain's top flight. They have a top, top coach like Ernesto Valverde - a two-time La Liga winner as Barcelona boss - and they play with good tempo in their approach. \nThat is their model and how they play, so expect their set-up behind the ball to be really good if counter-attack opportunities arise for Rangers.\nThere is no getting away from how big a task this is for Ferguson and his unpredictable players, but that is not to say they cannot hurt them - they can.\nFormer Rangers striker Steven Naismith was speaking to BBC Sport Scotland's Nick McPheat",

        "article_text": "Born in The Gambia to a Gambian father and Senegalese mother, Nicolas Jackson has risen from humble beginnings to become Chelsea's main striker\nNicolas Jackson's return from injury has been well timed for Chelsea, as the Blues look to land the Europa Conference League trophy and book a return to the Champions League for the first time since 2022-23.\nThe Senegalese has bagged nine goals in 26 games this season, turning himself into Enzo Maresca's first-choice striker following an up and down beginning to his Stamford Bridge career.\nNot that early starts have always been a problem.\n\"Sometimes we trained very early in the morning, especially when the sun was very hot,\" Pere Badara Sarr, the Casa Sports coach who discovered Jackson in Senegal, told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"He would say that once the rooster crowed, he'd be up and on his way to training.\"\nBorn in The Gambia, Jackson moved to Senegal aged 12, relocating to Ziguinchor, a village some 273 miles (440km) and a nine-hour car journey from the capital Dakar.\nWhile honing his skills playing with friends behind his house - sometimes barefoot - for more than two hours a day after school, Jackson would keep an ear out for visiting scouts or indications of organised trials.\n\"It was easy to pick him for a number of reasons, but mainly because of his style of play,\" Sarr added, having spotted Jackson at a national competition involving 8,000 young hopefuls.\n\"He had this unique pull on his team-mates that really made him stand out. They called him Neymar.\"\nZiguinchor is situated on the Casamance River in southern Senegal\nThe comparisons to Brazil's all-time top scorer may not have stuck, but Jackson has shown dedication worthy of top professionals.\n\"He lived with his mother, cousins and uncles, which kept him grounded,\" Sarr said.\n\"I can't remember him ever being late for training.\"\nFrom Casa Sports, Jackson's application earned him a move to La Liga club Villarreal aged 18.\n\"He told [his family] he wouldn't come back until he made it,\" Birane Hady Cisse, the sports editor at Senegalese news agency 373/500, told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"He's undoubtedly one of the top players we have now.\"\nDiomansy Kamara, who won a half-century of caps for Senegal, was instrumental in that transfer to Spain, with Cisse claiming the former Fulham and West Brom forward's guidance has been crucial.\n\"He understood how things worked in Europe and picked the best place for Jackson to develop, without focusing too much on where he could make money right away.\"\nJackson failed to find the net in his first 10 games for Villarreal's first team\nYet Jackson's European dream looked on shaky ground, as he alternated between Villarreal's youth and B teams while adapting to his new surroundings.\n\"When he came he was shy and looked raw,\" Javier Sidro, who covers the Yellow Submarine as the head of sports at Radio Castellon Cadena SER, told the BBC.\n\"But he paid attention and was always willing to improve.\"\nSecond-tier outfit Mirandes turned down the chance to sign Jackson permanently after just one goal in 17 outings on loan.\nBut such things can be a blessing in disguise, and Jackson returned to Villarreal knowing it was make or break.\nHe was eventually handed his first-team debut by Unai Emery as a late substitute against Real Betis in October 2021.\n\"In the weeks leading up to that, Emery had been preparing him as he liked his movement and saw the potential for greatness,\" Sidro revealed.\n\"It was interesting to keep an eye on him. He was capable of generating chances and looked really strong, but there was work to be done on his finishing.\"\nJackson was consigned to fleeting appearances from the bench for the rest of the season, with injuries also restricting his progress.\nJackson won his first cap for Senegal at the 2022 Fifa World Cup when he appeared against the Netherlands\nHe began the next campaign strongly, netting on his first La Liga start, but Emery's work to fully integrate him into the side ended when he left for Aston Villa in October 2022.\n\"Quique Setien replaced Emery and he saw something in Jackson too - a player who was clearly talented but hadn't yet reached his potential,\" Sidro said.\nJackson made his senior debut for Senegal at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Premier League clubs were starting to take notice.\nBournemouth agreed a fee of more than \u00a320m ($25.9m) to sign him in January 2023 but injury meant the deal fell through - with the Cherries snapping up Ghana forward Antoine Semenyo from Bristol City instead.\nOnce again, a failed transfer brought the best out of the Senegalese in the second half of that season.\n\"Jackson exploded, not instantly, but gradually,\" Sidro explained. \"Once he started, he was really unstoppable.\"\nNine goals in the final eight games of the La Liga campaign helped Villarreal finish fifth and qualify for the Europa League.\nChelsea, who at the time were changing their model to target young players, secured his services in June 2023, handing Jackson an eight-year contract.\nJackson's undulating career at Chelsea has seen him look like a world-beater in some games while showing naivety in others.\nHowever, he netted 14 league goals in his debut campaign and former Senegal striker Demba Ba, who spent 18 months with the Blues, thinks there is no doubt that Jackson will be a long-term success in west London.\n\"At Villarreal he was really good at making that final turn, and he'll be great at Chelsea,\" Ba said.\n\"He just needs to keep working hard and remember that he has to score goals.\"\nCould this season's run-in provide Jackson with the stage to prove that he is the real deal?\nShould he lead the Blues to a top-four finish, or score the goals that clinch a first trophy since 2021, then the boy from Ziguinchor may finally silence his doubters.",

        "article_text": "Chef Ruben Bond\u00ec knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church, in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving \u2013 and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bond\u00ec, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, the tradizione giudaico-romanesca (Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset of Roman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bond\u00ec, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Maurizio Fiorino)\nRuben Bond\u00ec is a Roman chef and food influencer whose cooking videos have earned him more than four million followers on social media. In 2023, he published a cookbook on Jewish Roman cuisine, Cucina con Ruben.\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes \u2013 expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy \u2013 from carciofi alla giudia (fried artichokes) to stracotto (braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing \u2013 typical [Jewish] dishes like concia di zucchine [marinated fried courgettes] and abbacchio [roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history \u2013 from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 \u2013 Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so] the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto \u2013 sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace \u2013 is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bond\u00ec's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae \u2013 the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol \u2013 Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\nDon't get your artichokes off-season\nWhile artichokes may be the undeniable star of the Roman Jewish kitchen, Bond\u00ec recommends visitors only consume the vegetable when it's in harvest. \"Avoid getting artichokes when they're off-season,\" he advises. \"You won't be served Italian artichokes, and they won't be as fresh. You should only get them when it's artichoke season, so from November-December to May.\"\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples is carciofi alla giudia \u2013 a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes like spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches in Venice, Florence and Milan. Its main restaurant \u2013 a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures \u2013 does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearby Ba'Ghetto Milky.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram: @baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institution Renato al Ghetto \u2013 where Bond\u00ec worked as a waiter in his younger days \u2013 realised it could replicate its success with street food, its\u00a0hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosette are a type of Roman bap,\" Bond\u00ec says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beef stracotto or Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chicken alla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under \u20ac12 (\u00a310).\n\"It's very good,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S.
