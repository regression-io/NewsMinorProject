Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added.\nSome of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.\nAnd the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face.\n\"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said.\nThe BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications.\nPeople have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons.\nKirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve.\nShe said her \"breasts were basically down to my bellybutton\" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said.\n\"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now,\" she said. \n\"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy.\"\nMen underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset.\nNose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023.\nFace and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated.\nBeauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol. \nThe pandemic also caused a shift, when the move towards video calls \"heightened our awareness of our appearance\" because people saw their own faces on their computer screens.\nDr Daniels said that society places value on youthful looks, which could push some women to get cosmetic procedures.\n\"As women age, they're often discounted in a number of ways\" and are \"made to feel invisible in society\", she said.\nBAAPS vice president Anthony Macquillan suggested the overall increase in facelifts could be linked to societal changes, such as the rising pension age.\nHe said: \"For many, this type of surgery is not just aesthetic but also functional, helping to maintain confidence, secure employment, and reduce anxiety associated with age-related bias.\"\nThe BAAPS data is based on statistics from 233 of its members. Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox.\nThe data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits. \nCosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\". \nIt advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure.\n\"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.",

        "article_text": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Wardrobe Ministry)\nBangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui. \u00a0\nHome to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\u00a0\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night \u2013 daytime, office hours \u2013 we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nTip:\nIf you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes\u00a0Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui \u2013 and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns \u2013 you name it \u2013 Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.\nTip:\nNightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach \u2013 that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui \u2013 eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds \u2013 the parties attract thousands of attendants \u2013 Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,\u00a0 Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\u00a0\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\u00a0\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach \u2013 Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional \u2013 truly local \u2013 food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\u00a0\nAs a sports enthusiast \u2013 he practices Muay Thai \u2013 Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand \u2013 \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says \u2013 the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring \u2013 the only one of its kind in the world.\u00a0\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite: \nhttps://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram: \n@rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\u00a0\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\n*This article, originally published on 26 February 2025, provides a companion to fans tuning into the Season 3 finale on 6 April.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Pope Francis has made a surprise appearance at St Peter's Square in the Vatican following his discharge from hospital after five weeks of treatment.\nThe Pope briefly appeared on stage in a wheelchair, with an oxygen tube under his nose.\n\"Hello to everybody,\" he said, waving to cheering crowds. \"Happy Sunday to all of you, thank you very much.\"\nThe Pope, 88, was discharged from hospital in Rome on 23 March and appeared at his window then to offer a blessing. \nDoctors said at the time he would need at least two months of rest at his residence. On Friday, the Vatican said his health was improving and he was \"in good spirits\" as he continued his work activities.\nThe Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February for an infection that resulted in double pneumonia.

        "article_text": "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.\nBut these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.\nThese are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.\nA new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.\nBoth these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nResearchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins. \nThe origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists. \nWhen the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.\nExperts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.\nConservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.\nIn 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.\nHowever, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.\nDolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.\nNachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble. \nUnder Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines. \nRiver cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\n\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.\nMr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.\nRiver dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.\nTheir poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.\nBut Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says.",

Jennifer said: \"She's really good with him and understands because she's been on the same journey.\"\nAlthough Sharpe is eager to progress to major competitions as soon as possible, he will have to wait until he is 15 for World Cup events, and 16 for the Winter Olympics, which would mean being eligible for the 2034 Games.\nThere is no minimum age for the X Games, however, which is by invitation.\n\"Nothing scares me,\" Sharpe said. \"I can't wait for next season already.

I basically use awards for doorstops.\n\"I have exactly six doors, for example, on the second floor of my Los Angeles home and I've also won six Emmys. So I will have to look for another door!\"\nPorter is the king of Broadway who is currently starring as the Emcee in the critically acclaimed Cabaret in the West End. \nHe tells us he loves UK audiences and says even though they are \"a little more reserved\" than US crowds, they have really \"loosened up\". \nPorter, who hosted the Olivier Awards with West End star Beverly Knight, does have a few words of advice for British cooks though. \nThe actor says \"while the food better than it used to be\", it still needs more \"salt and pepper, before you cook it, not after\".\nWe have offered to have him round for dinner at the BBC canteen, let's see if he accepts. \nGarai beat off stiff competition - including from herself - to take home the Olivier for best supporting actress for her role in The Years. \nShe was also nominated in the same category for Giant. \nIt is Garai's first Olivier win and she already has an idea where the prized trophy will be displayed. \n\"My little boy did ask that if I won, could he keep it in his room and I was like, 'I guess you can!' So it will be with all his action figures.\n\"I feel that I'm accepting this on behalf of my kids, my husband. Everybody wanted me to do something I felt so passionately about.\"\nTitanique is one of those shows where seeing really is believing. \nIt is a jukebox musical of Celine Dion hits, where Celine herself hijacks a museum tour about the Titanic in order to narrate her version of what happened the night the vessel sank. \nGot it? \nThe show won two Oliviers - best supporting actor in a musical for Layton Williams for his portrayal of the infamous iceberg, and best entertainment or comedy play. \nTitanique is a tribute to Celine's powerhouse vocals, so has the Canadian diva seen it yet? \nThe answer is not yet, but creators Tye Blue, Marla Mindelle and Constantine Rousouli say her set designer, backing singer and even Celine's sister have watched it. \nRousouli says he \"would explode into a million pieces of dust\" if Celine was in the audience. \nBut Mindelle, who originated the role of Celine in Titanique, says she \"would faint... then (the real) Celine Dion would walk on stage and somehow take over the part and it would be exactly the same. \n\"The show would go on without a hitch.\" \nMeera Syal's performance in A Tupperware of Ashes was greeted with rave reviews, so it is no surprise she was nominated for best actress at this year's awards. \nSyal played a mother diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease.  \nThe actress says she found out she had been nominated for the prestigious acting prize after leaving a Zumba class. \n\"I saw about 10 missed calls from my agent and quite a few from my daughter and thought, what is going on?\n\"So, sweaty and in my leggings, I rang up and got the news, and it was such a lovely surprise for a Tuesday morning!\"",

        "article_text": "England Women's captain Leah Williamson suffered an ACL injury when Arsenal faced Manchester United, which ruled her out of the 2023 World Cup\nA number of high-profile injuries have occurred in women's football in recent years - but could the type of pitches they play on be a contributing factor?\nThat is a question Brighton chief executive officer Paul Barber asked last week and he welcomed research into his theory. \nThe Seagulls hope to build a new purpose-built stadium for the women's team by 2027-28 and are exploring all scientific research to make facilities the best.\nThat includes finding out whether pitch surfaces designed for male athletes are adequate for females. If not, what is the best solution?\nFemale footballers might need 'different pitch type' to cut injury risk\nMost top-tier football pitches are now hybrid, which means they are essentially a synthetic mat through which real grass can grow. \nThese pitches feel like natural grass but can be regrown each year. They are also hard-wearing, which means they can be drained and recovered to play football on. \nHowever, most of these pitches - which are used predominantly in the men's Premier League - are made up of 95% sand and 4-5% polyethylene fibres to help reduce waterlogging. \nWomen's Super League teams use a variety of grounds across the season but all pitches meet the minimum elite standards required by the league licence. \nBrighton's Broadfield Stadium is one of the only natural grass surfaces in the WSL, with most clubs playing on a hybrid pitch. \nArsenal, Aston Villa and Leicester City use their male counterparts' stadiums as their main home pitch, as well as occasionally playing at secondary grounds.\nWest Ham were the only WSL club not to play a match at their men's team stadium last season. \nThe Bescot Stadium - home of League Two Walsall FC - is used for Villa's matches in the Women's League Cup and FA Cup and was recently renovated.\nCrystal Palace, who earned promotion from the Women's Championship, play the majority of their matches on the VBS Community Stadium and the pitch was replaced with a new hybrid surface this season. \nAnd Leicester City's second pitch - Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium - is an artificial grass pitch and is only used when there are scheduling clashes.\nBrighton Women play some WSL matches at the Amex Stadium\nWhile little research has been carried out regarding pitches for female athletes specifically, plenty of data has been gathered in football generally. \nEverything from traction, the hardness of the surface, how high the ball bounces, how far the ball rolls and shock absorption have been looked into. \nNeil Rodger, the principal consultant at STRI Group - a company working in the development of sports surfaces - admitted more research was needed to see if there was any link to increased injury risk in female footballers and certain pitches.\n\"It's never been broken down into men's football and women's football. We've always just designed football pitches,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"When you think about injuries in the men's or women's game, there are so many factors that contribute - the training load, sleep, physiology, hormones...\n\"The pitch is a factor, it's in the mix. Historically, in the women's and men's game, there have been unsafe pitches. In the modern game, that's not really the case. \n\"Particularly in the Premier League, the pitch quality is exceptional and the grounds teams are very good. There's more research needed to see if there is any link.\"\nRodger said it was unknown if there was \"a very subtle difference between what is optimal for the men's game and what is for the women's game\", but the volume of matches played in shared stadiums was no doubt a contributing factor in reducing the quality of surfaces.\n\"Arsenal Women play a lot of matches at the Emirates and the grounds team will prepare the pitch to the exact same high standard as they would for the men,\" he added. \n\"But whether it's men's or women's, the more games you play on a pitch, the more wear and tear it takes and the more the quality of the pitch is going to be impacted. \n\"More usage means more maintenance needed. That is a factor.\"\nHaving coached in the Women's Super League and on the international stage, West Ham boss Rehanne Skinner has experienced a number of pitch surfaces.\nBut she believed it was not the type of surface, but how you manage the quality of the pitches which was the most important factor to consider. \n\"It's got to be about investment into the quality of the pitch or how you manage stadiums independently to reduce the volume of games on them,\" added Skinner. \n\"We groundshare in a lot of instances and that means the pitches take a lot - TV masks some of it. When you're actually standing on them, they look very different. \n\"I think the bottom line is, it is down to the volume of games on the pitch. That definitely needs to be something that's addressed.\"\nFormer Chelsea and England defender Claire Rafferty suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in her career - and believed the pitch was a contributing factor.\nWhile the 36-year-old admitted it was not something she thought about while playing, Rafferty said the idea that the pitches male players currently play on may not be optimal for women was an \"interesting concept\". \n\"The only limitation is we're trying to improve the standard of the game in general, so do we increase barriers to entry if we have women-only pitches?\" Rafferty told BBC Sport. \n\"When we're looking at grassroots, are we limiting access? Yes, there needs to be research, but there is that argument too.\n\"My ideal pitch would be a grass pitch. If we get into the details of the grass length, that can have an impact as well. \n\"If the grass is too long, then you're at risk of the boots getting stuck and non-contact injuries. But if it's too short and dry then you don't have that balance there.\"\nFormer Scotland international Jen Beattie played at the Emirates Stadium regularly with Arsenal\nFormer Scotland and Arsenal defender Jen Beattie said there were \"so many different factors\" that could contribute to injury, but playing surfaces should not be the primary focus.\nThree major names, Vivianne Miedema, Beth Mead and Leah Williamson, suffered ACL injuries while playing for the Gunners, and Chelsea striker Sam Kerr is not expected back until April 2025 after being sidelined since January 2024.\n\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing and I think separating men and women and playing on different pitches just makes the games go even further apart rather than looking at other things that I think are more important,\" Beattie told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"If we're talking about ACLs, that comes from more conditioning and physicality. There needs to be more research into women's health because we are just different.\n\"That's a proven fact. The priority needs to be looking at that rather than playing on different pitches. I've no idea how logistically that would work.\"\nA number of clubs now track players' menstrual cycles following recent studies linking periods to ACL injuries. \nThere has also been research carried out by organisations such as the European Club Association (ECA) on how varying footwear can contribute to injury risk.\n\"I think there needs to be more research specifically for women,\" said ex-England striker Ellen White, who suffered an ACL injury during her career.\n\"Women are built slightly differently with childbearing hips, or you are on your period, so your ligaments are slightly looser.\n\"But I feel there needs to be more research into exactly why certain movements happen or more strength and conditioning to help with the muscles in and around the knee.\n\"I was unlucky, I went for a couple of challenges and my knee just gave out. I don't think there was an overarching reason why. It was just luck of the draw.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.\nHong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.\nSo when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note. \nHong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operation, sometime in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.\nThe project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains. \n\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.\nThe Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.\nTo spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India. \nUnder those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.\n\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert. \nBut many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands. \nServing them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector. \nTheir affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market. \nAshok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra. \n\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.\n\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"\nSo how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?\n\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma. \n\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.\n\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"\nMaking the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands. \nWhile popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.\nMeanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.\nSabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.\nMr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative. \n\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.\n\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"\nComet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.\nIt claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.\n\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.\nHe says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.\n\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.\nChange is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"\n\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds. \nBack in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.\n\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"\nBut Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.\n\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.\n\"But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.\"",

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

He is looking for a third victory in four years, while McIlroy is seeking to win the title for the first time.\nScheffler had a standout year in 2024, winning nine events including the Masters, and while he has not enjoyed the same stellar start to 2025, he is yet to finish outside the top 20 in five previous appearances in the first men's major of the year.\nMcIlroy, ranked second, needs this title to become just the sixth player to win the career Grand Slam of all four majors. It will be his 11th attempt to join a pantheon of greats including Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen and Gary Player.\nFor the first time, the Northern Irishman has won twice on the PGA Tour before arriving at Augusta, including last month's prestigious Players Championship, which has only intensified the hype.\nBut there are potential winners everywhere in the 96-man field.\nSwedish sensation Ludvig Aberg finished runner-up to Scheffler last year in a debut major to remember. Could he go on to emulate Jordan Spieth, who finished second in his debut year, before winning the title 12 months later in 2015?\nEngland's Tommy Fleetwood will be encouraged by his joint third last year, while his compatriot Matt Fitzpatrick is a proven major winner and Wolverhampton's Aaron Rai is making his Masters debut after rising through the rankings.\nScotland's Bob MacIntyre is making his first start in three years but made the cut in his first two attempts, with a best finish of joint 12th. He arrives in Augusta with five top-15 returns in 2025.\nXander Schauffele has had four top-10 finishes in his previous six Masters and is coming off the back of a breakthrough 2024 in the majors where he won his first and second titles.\nCollin Morikawa, ranked one place below Schauffele at fourth in the world, also enjoys Augusta and has had three top-10s in his past three starts, finishing joint third in 2024.\nUS Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is enjoying something of a renaissance in his career and is 14th in the world rankings.\nThe 38-year-old has never finished inside the top 20 at Augusta but won his seventh PGA Tour title at last year's BMW Championship and has had two top-10s this season, making the cut in all seven events he has played.\nLIV Golf is well represented, with a dozen players from the Saudi-backed circuit heading to Georgia.\nJon Rahm won this title in 2023 and perhaps has a better chance of adding to his tally than Dustin Johnson (2020), Patrick Reed (2018) and Sergio Garcia (2017) who are all recent champions.\nChile's Joaquin Niemann has won twice on the LIV circuit this year and is once again being touted as a potential winner, while Bryson DeChambeau showed playing the 54-hole LIV tournaments had not harmed his major aspirations as he won his second US Open title last year\nAnd finally... although he is not a favourite to win, many eyes will be on Germany's Bernhard Langer this week as the 67-year-old makes his 41st and final start on the 40th anniversary of the first of his two wins.\nFive-time Masters champion Tiger Woods will not be playing at Augusta National this year because he is still recovering after rupturing an Achilles tendon in March.\nOn 1 April the 15-time major champion wrote on X: \"I can't believe I am saying this, but a few weeks after rupturing my left Achilles, the sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber plus the explosive lifts, my doctors and trainers have me ready to play the Masters next week!

April Fools my Achilles is still a mess :)\"\nWoods had surgery on the injury, which also kept him out of the PGA Tour's flagship Players Championship, on 11 March.\nHe had been hoping to make his comeback at Augusta, having not competed in a PGA Tour event since last July's Open at Royal Troon.\nThe 49-year-old then had his sixth back procedure in 10 years in September 2024.\nWoods planned to return at the Genesis Invitational in February but withdrew following the death of his mother, Kultida.\n\nThe BBC weather forecast for Augusta, Georgia is predicting drizzle and light rain on the Monday and Wednesday practice days of Masters week, with a sunnier day on Tuesday and maximum temperatures of 15C.\nThere is little to no rain and light winds forecast for the Championship days. The temperature is set to warm up throughout the week with a maximum of 18C for the final round on Sunday.\nMasters tradition dictates that the new champion is helped into his Green Jacket by the previous year's winner\nIt is arguably the most sought-after jacket in sport.\nThe great Bobby Jones, founder of the Augusta National Golf Club in 1933 and co-founder of the Masters which began in 1934, came up with the idea of a members' jacket.\nThe American amateur, who won seven majors, took his lead from Royal Liverpool, after winning The Open in 1927. He liked the red hunting jacket worn by the club's former captains.\nRed, yellow and 'Georgia peach' colours were all floated between Jones and his business partner Clifford Roberts before the latter, inspired by the colour of the leaves on the azalea bushes that dominate Augusta National, suggested green.\nThe idea was that members wore the jacket and were therefore easily recognisable by spectators visiting the course.\nSam Snead was the first Masters winner to be awarded a Green Jacket, in 1949.\nIt is made of an inexpensive wool-polyester mix and costs about \u00a3195 to make each one. The colour is known as 'Pantone 342'.\nEach jacket is kept permanently in the Champions Locker Room and only worn during Masters Week, strictly within the confines of Augusta National's clubhouse.\nInitially, only first-time winners were allowed to remove the jacket from the property and then just for the first 12 months. Recently, winners have been given a replica jacket they can take away.\nThe Par 3 Contest is a relaxing Wednesday-afternoon event with families and friends heavily involved\nFirst played in 1960, the Par 3 Contest has become the traditional fun curtain-raiser to the Masters.\nIt will start around 17:00 BST on Wednesday, 10 April. Most players have their wives, girlfriends, children, or even grandchildren as caddies and dressed in the traditional white boiler suits.\nNon-competing past champions such as Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson still play in the nine-hole event that criss-crosses DeSoto Springs Pond and Ike's Pond.\nFamously, no player has won the Par 3 Contest and then gone on to win the Green Jacket in the same year.\nBBC Sport will have live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra across all four days.\nThere will also be live text commentary, in-play clips, video highlights, reaction and analysis on the BBC Sport website and app. \nMonday, 7 April\n21:00-22:00 BST - BBC Radio 5 Live preview show, also on BBC Sounds and via BBC Sport website\nThursday, 10 April\n12:30-01:00 - live text commentary on round one on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds\nFriday, 11 April\n12:30-01:00 - live text commentary on round two on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:30-22:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\n22:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds\nSaturday, 12 April\n17:00-01:00 - live text commentary on round three on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n21:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\nSunday, 13 April\n17:00-01:00 - live text commentary on round four on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\n",

Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.\nOnce an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.\nSince he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.\nIt has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.\nIsraeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.\nEarlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.\nAnother four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.\nSince then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.\nCharles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".\nSince the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria, the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".\nMany Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.\nSome say that view is now changing.\n\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"\nSyria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.\nAhmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.\nAt least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.\nThose former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.\nSyrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.\nBut outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil.",

Amazon declined to comment.Trump has said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk, although the latter said he had no intention of buying.Other potential buyers include billionaire Frank McCourt, together with Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragons' Den.Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X last month that he had joined Mr McCourt's bid.The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also said he's looking to buy TikTok as part of a group of investors.Tim Stokely, the British founder of OnlyFans, has also to offered to buy TikTok under his recently re-launched company, Zoop.Computing giant Microsoft, private equity giant Blackstone, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and search engine Perplexity AI are also reportedly in the running for a stake. His order did not overturn the ban on the app passed into law by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court.Trump could allow the law to stand, but ask the Department of Justice to continue to ignore it.The government would effectively be telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok on to their devices.",

That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.\nBy comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.\nThe UK FTSE index has fallen sharply though not by as much.\nThis is partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning. \nFollow live updates\nNevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.\nA decline of 20% from a peak is considered a \"bear market\" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.\nWhile many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types \u2013 defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.\nThat may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off \u2013 but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a \"safe haven\" along with other assets such as gold. \nThat is exactly what has happened here. \nGovernment bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.\nThe closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.\nThere have been many falls like this in the decades since the Wall Street Crash but in the long term, shares have turned out to be a good investment \u2013 and pension savings is a long term game.\nIt does matter. A company's share value is a measure of how profitable those companies are expected to be in the future. A plummeting market is an indication that most people think that most companies are likely to see their profits fall.\nThe markets believe that US President Donald Trump's tariff bombshell is expected to raise prices, lower demand and reduce profits, making companies less valuable and more inclined to cut investment and jobs.\nSo the real warning sign here is not about the value of your pension but about the health of the economy in which we live and work.\nFalls like this sometimes, often even, herald an economic downturn. That is more of a worry than the value of your pension, which has seen and will see volatility like this over the years.\nBut that's not to say this is not a very big moment for the world economy.",

We already have people there. We'll have more people there. We'll help as much as we can [but] it's not the easiest place to work\u2026 they have a military junta that doesn't like us,\" Rubio said.\nOn Tuesday, a former USAID official told the BBC the shuttering of the agency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, meant the White House could not send teams from the US to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the 28 March magnitude 7.7 earthquake. \nThe confirmed death toll rose to 3,354 on 4 April, Myanmar's ruling military said. The number of injured stood at 4,508, while 220 were still missing.\nRoutinely in such earthquakes, the US can deploy up to 200 rescue workers and sniffer dogs along with specialist equipment, and is often the biggest and best equipment foreign response team on the ground. \nLast week, the state department said a US team of three advisers based in the region was being sent to disaster zone.\nSpeaking to reporters at a Nato meeting in Brussels,  Rubio blamed the military regime in Myanmar for the lack of access, even though the state department said earlier this week the country had made a formal request for assistance. \nFormer USAID officials say their work is seen as non-political, and they have previously accessed countries regarded as politically hostile.\n\"That would have impeded our response, no matter what,\" said Rubio.\n\"That said, we are willing to continue to help in the humanitarian crisis. Other countries need to do so as well. China is a very rich country. India is a rich country. There are a lot of other countries in the world, and everyone should pitch in.\"\nChina and India were among the first to have teams on the ground in Myanmar, according to former American humanitarian officials.\nRubio dismissed the accounts of humanitarian aid experts who said the inability to deploy a large US rescue team was due to the USAID cuts.\n\"These are people that make millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in these NGOs [non-governmental organisations] all over the world that stand up and they get flooded with the US taxpayer money, and then we have to spend 10 [or] 100 million dollars to get 10 million to people. We're not doing that anymore. Okay? We have stopped. We are no longer going to spend 10 million, 100 million dollars to get 10 million to recipients.\n\"We're not going to fund these global NGOs all over the world that are living off of this. We're not doing it.\n\"We are prepared to help and work with governments and appropriate NGOs on the ground that are delivering assistance. We will be there, and we will be helpful [but] there are a lot of other rich countries, they should also pitch in and help\u2026 we are going to do our part,\" Rubio added.\nAs news of the Myanmar earthquake emerged, the White House had reportedly tried to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) from the US - but could not do so because the Trump administration's cuts had cancelled logistics contracts and fired officials who oversaw such deployments, according to the former officials. \nThe cuts to USAID had been led by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after President Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".",

That's the first time that's happened and that's only a few weeks ago,\" he said.\n\"A bad feeling came over me,\" he added, describing Lady Stewart's mind as being in \"a new world\".\nSir Jackie, who lives in Buckinghamshire but is from Scotland, described how his wife of more than 60 years had been diagnosed with dementia after she lost control of her small car and it landed on its roof.\nNo-one had been hurt, he said, but the incident had led to an \"awareness that something wasn't right\".\nA decade later, Sir Jackie said the progression of the disease was such that Lady Stewart could no longer walk.\n\"I know that Helen doesn't mean it when she suddenly goes round and hits me, or the [specialist dementia] nurses,\" he said.\n\"She can hit somebody quite often, she uses language that she's never ever said in her life and it comes like that [clicks his fingers] and I say 'darling, darling, don't say that'.\n\"She says 'Why?' And she'll give me a row for doing that. That's usually after 17:00.\"\n'\"Sundowning\" is a common feature of dementia, where the brain tires and a person becomes more agitated later in the day.\nSir Jackie created an accessible home in Switzerland for Lady Stewart without steps or obstacles - and they employ nurses and specialist neurosurgeons.\nHe said he was aware of the privilege his F1 career had afforded him, and that for many families the only option was residential care.\n\"I visit homes for people with dementia and I leave in tears because people are completely lost,\" he said.\nOne in three people will develop dementia in their lifetime, which Sir Jackie describes as a \"disaster\". \nHe said friends and a former secretary had also been diagnosed and understanding the brain was \"bigger than going to the moon\". \nResearch progress had been \"very slow\", with the medical profession \"failing so far\" and diseases like cancer being prioritised, he said.\nHis charity is now funding the development of a new blood test trial to detect signs of frontotemporal dementia 10 to 20 years before it is diagnosed.\nDr Maura Malpetti, senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said the ON-FIRE study was looking at the type of frontotemporal dementia that was not genetic - where diagnoses could not necessarily be predicted.\nDr Malpetti said people with frontotemporal dementia were often misdiagnosed.\n\"It is confused with psychiatric conditions because of the behavioural changes or the language problems,\" she said.\nHer team is looking at how the presence of certain proteins in the blood could indicate the likelihood of future inflammation in the brain.\nChanges in the blood could be present decades before the onset of physical symptoms and they were usually only picked up by scans, which took longer to carry out and required specialist equipment.\nA major problem facing trials for new dementia drugs is that they often involve patients who have already received a diagnosis.\nIt means they are already showing symptoms - but by this time, it may be too late for the drugs to make a difference. \nIdentifying individuals decades before they show symptoms allows researchers to trial drugs to see if they reduce the risk of dementia.\nThree hundred patients were being recruited at 20 centres across England and Dr Malpetti said the trial would eventually be rolled out to 1,000 participants.\nThe study is one of a number of dementia blood tests being developed in the UK, including one at the University of Oxford.\nDr Malpetti said they hoped to see \"tremendous\" developments in the next five years because of the number of inflammation studies.\n\"I think there's been a revelation in the field of blood tests because this allows us to use more accessible and scalable tests,\" she said.\nDr Malpetti said they would freeze the samples so that if a new inflammation marker was discovered, they could go back and test that in the blood.\nShe added an earlier diagnosis would empower families, allowing them to contribute to research to find a cure.\n\"The earlier we understand the changes in the brain, maybe we can stop or slow down the symptoms while the person is still well,\" she said.\nSir Jackie said Formula One brought funding and business acumen to health research.\nThe most recent fundraiser was the One Lap Challenge ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.\n\"When you have a problem in Formula One [clicks his fingers] it's fixed... they're also changing it [technology] all the time, because they have enthusiasm, and they see the results,\" he said.\nDr Malpetti said she hoped charities like Race against Dementia could transform research, helping it to progress faster.\nSir Jackie said he hoped a cure could be found in his lifetime.\n\"I want this to happen just as much as I wanted to be world champion,\" he said. \"It's terribly important.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

Research progress had been \"very slow\", with the medical profession \"failing so far\" and diseases like cancer being prioritised, he said.His charity is now funding the development of a new blood test trial to detect signs of frontotemporal dementia 10 to 20 years before it is diagnosed.Dr Maura Malpetti, senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said the ON-FIRE study was looking at the type of frontotemporal dementia that was not genetic - where diagnoses could not necessarily be predicted.Nikki Fox/BBCDr Maura Malpetti says 20,000 people in the UK have frontotemporal dementia Dr Malpetti said people with frontotemporal dementia were often misdiagnosed. \"When you have a problem in Formula One [clicks his fingers] it's fixed... they're also changing it [technology] all the time, because they have enthusiasm, and they see the results,\" he said.Dr Malpetti said she hoped charities like Race against Dementia could transform research, helping it to progress faster.Sir Jackie said he hoped a cure could be found in his lifetime.",

They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.\nThese are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.\nA new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.\nBoth these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nResearchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins. \nThe origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists. \nWhen the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.\nExperts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.\nConservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.\nIn 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.\nHowever, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.\nDolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.\nNachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble. \nUnder Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines. \nRiver cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\n\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.\nMr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.\nRiver dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.\nTheir poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.\nBut Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says.",

Need a differential for the rest of the season? Confused about chip strategy?\nGet your questions in for Gianni on X using #bbcfootball.\nIn the meantime, here's our week 31 team of the week for some short-term inspiration.\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\nManchester City held the team together with captain Omar Marmoush (18 points) and clean sheets for Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.\nAside from that it was a lot of one and two-pointers for 43 points.

He has not finished a season with just one goal since 2020-21, so the law of averages means he is due.\nDjed Spence, Spurs, \u00a34.4m - Southampton (h)\nWhile Tottenham's form is nose-diving again, they face a Saints side with just 22 goals in 30 games - the league's lowest total.\nSpence seems to be holding down that right-back spot and, if they do keep a clean sheet, has a great chance of bonus.\nIn Tottenham's recent back-to-back clean sheets, against Brentford and Manchester United, Spence earned the maximum three bonus points.\nKieran Trippier, Newcastle, \u00a35.6m - Leicester (a)\nAm I getting suckered in with memories of prime Trippier from the past two seasons, when he had nine and 10 assists?

His final appearance was at the 2023 Rugby World Cup. \nHe won three Six Nations titles and a Grand Slam with Wales and was captain during the Wayne Pivac era.\nBiggar went on two British and Irish Lions tours, making three Test appearances in South Africa in 2021.\n\"There comes a point where you just know, not because of anything in particular, but someone once said to me 'when you know, you'll know',\" Biggar said as he announced his decision on social media.\n\"Rugby has given me everything. I threw myself into this game at 17 and it's given me a life that I could never have imagined.\n\"I've lived out my childhood dreams for the best part of two decades and I'm so, so grateful for that.\"\nBiggar started his youth career at Gorseinon RFC and Gowerton Comprehensive in Swansea before playing a season for Swansea RFC in the Welsh Premiership.\nHe made his senior Ospreys debut in 2008 and during an 11-year spell made 221 appearances and scored 2,203 points, making him the region's record points scorer.\nBiggar was also instrumental in securing two Pro12 titles in 2010 and 2012 and paid tribute to a former Ospreys coach in his retirement address.\n\"A special mention has to go to Sean Holley, who took a chance on a young, cocky 17-year-old when public opinion told him to do otherwise. Who knows if things would have turned out if you hadn't, so thank you Sean,\" he said.\nNorthampton came calling in 2018 and Biggar made 69 appearances for Saints, helping them to lift the Premiership Rugby Cup and reach the league knock-out stages in his first season.\nBefore his contract at Franklin's Gardens expired, Biggar took an opportunity to sign for French giants Toulon, where he will see out the remainder of the 2024-2025 season.\nToulon's Dan Biggar and Charles Ollivon celebrate winning the European Challenge Cup in 2023 \nReflecting on his career, Biggar said there had been moments in rugby he would never forget, including winning his first cap for Wales in 2008, becoming a Test centurion in 2022 and a Lion the previous year.\nBut he says those are not been his greatest achievements.\n\"The thing I'm most proud about is being able to give my family opportunities in life, that's what means the most to me and what I'm most proud of,\" Biggar said.\n\"To my amazing wife Alex and my two beautiful boys I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me. You were always there to pick me up when things were low and have been by my side through everything when I've needed it. I'm very lucky.\"\nBiggar also remembered his late mother, who he described as his \"biggest fan\".\n\"The one person who isn't here to say thank you to is my mum, who sadly passed away four years ago,\" he said.\n\"Everything I've done over the last 18 years is because of her.\"\nDan Biggar welcomes his son to the Principality Stadium in 2022\nBiggar admitted wearing the prestigious 10 shirt for Wales \"hasn't always been plain sailing and easy\", but it helped to make him a stronger person and player. \nHe also reflected on a difficult past year at Toulon.\n\"I also know that the last 12 months haven't quite gone as I'd hoped with Toulon, it's been tough and setbacks teach you a lot more about yourself and over the last 12 months I've learned a huge amount,\" he said.\n\"There's no real perfect moment to walk away, but this does feel like the right one. \n\"I'm choosing to retire, which a lot of sportspeople don't get to do when they're healthy and I feel very grateful and excited about what's coming next.\n\"Rugby will always be a part of me, but now it's time to give a little bit of time back to my family in this beautiful part of the world and see what challenges come next.\"\nBiggar finished by thanking the game of rugby itself, the people, the memories and  lessons.\n\"I can honestly say I gave it everything I had and now it's time for something new,\" he said.\n\"Thank you, diolch, merci.\"",

It is also lower than the new US tariffs levied on other countries, such as the 20% tax on the European Union.\n\"Ironically it could be a good thing,\" he says. \"These retailers who would have sourced from Europe might now say 'actually we'll buy more from the UK.\"\nFor something not visible to the naked eye, organic chemicals are a huge US export for the UK, totalling close to \u00a33bn last year.\nThey are used across a massive range of industries from food to make-up to engines and into agriculture.\nRather than feeling fearful about the US tariff, Robinsons Brothers reckons it may help the West Bromwich-based organic chemicals firm wrestle back American customers from cheaper overseas rivals.\nChief executive Adrian Hanrahan says: \"We supplied a lot more to the US but China and India knocked us out of that because of very low pricing.\"\nUnder Trump's new regime, China's imports face a 34% tariff while India's products will be taxed at 27%. Robinsons Brothers chemicals are already taxed at 6% when they reach the US \nMr Hanrahan says he is still trying to nail down whether the new 10% US tariff on UK goods means Robinsons Brothers' American customers will be paying an additional 4% or a total 16%.\n\"Either way, it is a lot less than China or India will see going into the US,\" he says. \"So I am really hoping and seeing an opportunity for us here in one area.\" \nHe says that since January, the company has been receiving more enquiries from the US, including two customers Robinsons Brothers lost five years ago \"at great expense\".\nAt the moment, Robinsons Brothers derives between 1.5% and 2% of total sales - which reached \u00a324m last year - from America. \nThis \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.\nThere are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.\nMr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.\"\nUK exports to the US linked to aircraft totalled \u00a32.2bn in 2024, official figures show.\nDPS Designs contributes a small - but important part - to that industry. The Forest of Dean-based firm makes metal moulds that are used to create plastic sections of airplane seats.\nThe US is DPS's biggest growth market. Around \u00a3150,000 worth of sales come directly from the US out of a total \u00a33m.  \nThe company's managing director of engineering, Sebastian Down, says the firm will negotiate with its customers \"to see if we can share in the pain\" of the new 10% tariffs - once he deciphers what they apply to.\n\"The amount of detail is paper-thin,\" he said.\nDPS Designs has already had to grapple with the ambiguous language used by the White House around tariffs, after Trump announced 25% trade tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US. The company uses aluminium to make its moulds.\n\"There was no-one you could speak to so it relied on me going onto the US department of whatever website, trying to look at lots of detail that basically didn't exist,\" he says.\nUltimately, the aluminium tariff does not apply to his business. But the new 10% tariff criteria isn't clear either. Does it, for example, apply to parts that make up a product or only to the finished article itself? \n\"It is as clear as mud,\" says Mr Down. \nThe US market for British-made cars is of enormous consequence for the UK economy. Last year, the UK exported \u00a39bn worth to America. \nThe sector was already reeling from Trump's previously announced 25% US tariff on cars and light vehicles.  \nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, says: \"These tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting US consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic British brands.\"\nWith Trump's announcement on Wednesday of 10% US taxes on nearly all UK imports, the net will now widen to include the likes of electric motorcycle-maker Maeving.\nSeb Inglis-Jones, co-founder and co-chief executive of the Coventry company, says that sales from the US are \"ever evolving\". Last month, for example, 68% of sales came from America though typically, the US makes up about 40% of its \u00a36m annual turnover.\nMr Inglis-Jones says that the US has helped counterbalance a less-than-optimistic economic outlook in Maeving's other key markets such as the UK, France and Germany.\n\"In the US, there's just more disposable income and so with a slightly more discretionary purchase like ours, a slightly more expensive British built electric motorcycle, Americans are just way more able to spend that money.\"\nHe says that Maeving recently raised prices in the US, not as a pre-emptive move before tariffs but because the cost of doing business in the States had increased.\nWill the company now lift prices again?\n\"We haven't got that far,\" says Mr Inglis-Jones. \"I think we care more about, as a young EV [electric vehicle] company, about the growth and making sure the price is right for the US customer.\n\"If we can't stomach it, we will have to put the prices up again.\"",

        "article_text": "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.\nBut these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.\nThese are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.\nA new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.\nBoth these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nResearchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins. \nThe origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists. \nWhen the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.\nExperts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.\nConservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.\nIn 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.\nHowever, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.\nDolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.\nNachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble. \nUnder Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines. \nRiver cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\n\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.\nMr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.\nRiver dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.\nTheir poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.\nBut Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins.

        "article_text": "Nasa says there is a small chance a recently spotted asteroid could collide with the Moon. Studying it can inform our understanding of the Earth's past and our future.\nEach year, according to Nasa, a chunk of rock the size of a car hurtles through space on a collision course with our planet. Fortunately, thanks to the Earth's atmosphere acting as a natural shield, instead of crash landing on the ground, the asteroid burns up and produces an impressive light show, streaking across the sky as a meteor or fireball.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, other, much larger asteroids have the potential to be far more threatening than entertaining. \"Asteroids come in all sizes,\" says Michael K\u00fcppers, a planetary scientist for the European Space Agency (ESA). \"The really big ones, like the 10km (6.21 mile) [wide] or so asteroid that we think led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, happen maybe once every 100 million years.\"\nThe asteroid 2024 YR4, which was discovered in December 2024, has been making headlines around the world recently. It was initially estimated to be around 40-90m (131-295ft) wide, arger than a 12-storey building. In January this year, the ESA calculated the rock's trajectory and initially predicted that there was a 1.2% chance of impact with Earth on 22 December 2032.\nThis officially crossed the comfortable threshold of risk for a near-Earth object \u2013 1% \u2013 and triggered the need for investigation by several planetary defence organisations, as well as the US President and US Congress.\u00a0\nLuckily YR4 is not large enough to be capable of making our species extinct but it could still be a \"city killer\", according to some experts, if it is at the upper end of the estimated size range and landed in a heavily populated area.\u00a0\nIn February 2025, the risk of the asteroid hitting the Earth briefly climbed to 3.1% or one in 32. Luckily, humanity managed to avoid mass panic and the risk has since reduced to a more reassuring 0.001%. Then in April 2025, Nasa released details of new observations of YR4 from the James Webb Space Telescope, estimating it to be slightly smaller than first thought \u2013 around 53-67m (174-220ft), or about the size of a 10 story building.\u00a0\nBut Nasa's Centre for Near Earth Object Studies also updated the chance of YR4 hitting the Moon \u2013 on 22 December 2032 \u2013 to 3.8% from 1.7% that was predicted at the end of February 2025. Even with this small increase in the chance of a collision with the Moon, it is not big enough to alter the Moon's orbit, they said.\u00a0\nSo, where did this asteroid come from in the first place? And how concerned should we be about a similar scenario emerging in the future?\u00a0\nWhen it comes to understanding asteroids, astronomers and scientists are still being dealt the cards in order to understand the rules of this potentially risky celestial game.\n\"Scientifically there's a huge amount we can learn from asteroids,\" says Alan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer at Queens University Belfast and a member of one of Nasa's sky surveys that searches and tracks Near Earth Objects (NEOs). These are asteroids whose orbit brings them within 195 million km (121 million miles) of the Sun.\n\"Any asteroid we detect is generally a fragment of a much larger body that was formed at the birth of our Solar System\" says Fitzsimmons. \"So by studying their chemical make-up we get some idea of the conditions in the initial Solar System as since then, over 4.6 billion years, it has evolved dynamically.\"\u00a0\nThese ancient rocky remnants are sometimes referred to as minor planets. Often irregular and cratered, they can also be spherical. They can spin slow, fast or tumble. Usually solitary, they can sometimes be found in pairs (binary or double asteroids) and some even have their own moon. Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's website keeps tabs on their numbers and at the last count there are over 1.4 million in our Solar System. The majority are located within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter but millions more are too small to be detected.\u00a0\nMost of the time these asteroids remain restrained within that interplanetary belt by Jupiter's gravitational field, unable to coalesce into a larger body. But occasionally another asteroid or the influence of Jupiter's gravity can nudge some into another orbit around the Sun, towards the inner Solar System.\nOnce an asteroid has been ejected from its usual path and is potentially heading our way, the first challenge is to detect it.\u00a0\n\"All an asteroid looks like in a telescope is a point of light against other points of lights that are stars, except it's moving,\" says Kelly Fast, Nasa's acting planetary defence officer, \"and it's reflecting sunlight.\"\nThe brighter the asteroid, the bigger it will be. But its colour also affects the brightness as a small white asteroid might reflect more light than a much larger dark one. It's not an exact science, which is why YR4's size was initially estimated at 40-90m (131-295ft) wide. The more information we have, however, the more precise that number will becomes.\n\"A team at Nasa and an ESA team will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to take infrared observations of YR4,\" says Fast. These measurements of an asteroid's thermal emissions \"may be helpful for constraining that size range\", she adds.\nYR4, in common with most asteroids,\u00a0is from the asteroid belt. \"Which part of the belt is hard to tell,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"One clue that we have is a spectrum of its surface.\" By examining the intensity of light emitted over a range of wavelengths, specific materials on the surface of the asteroid can be identified. \"YR4 is a rocky asteroid that's deficient in lighter elements such as carbon, which tells us that it probably came from the inner asteroid belt,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"But exactly where we don't know \u2013 and we may never know.\"\nAsteroids are not all the same either. \"There are different populations,\" says Fast. \"Some are stony, some are carbonaceous and some have metallic content depending on the parent bodies they came from.\"\nWhile there are rare types of asteroids, more than three out of four are carbonaceous, or C-type, and contain carbon, appearing black as coal. The rest are mostly S-type or silicaceous \u2013 a mix of metal and silicate crystals \u2013 or metallic or M-type asteroids, which contain predominantly iron and nickel.\u00a0\nOne asteroid scientists are particularly interested in is\u00a0 \u2013 a large, metal-rich rock the shape of a potato, which inhabits the Solar System's main asteroid belt. It's thought this asteroid could be up to 95% nickel and iron, which is similar to the Earth's core. Studying it will therefore increase our understanding of how our own planet formed. Nasa's Psyche mission is currently on its way there and is due to arrive in August 2029.\nIn terms of metal content, asteroids like Psyche 16 are also potentially extremely valuable \u2013 it's thought to contain resources worth approximately US$10 quadrillion (\u00a37.8 quadrillion). In the future, if asteroid mining ever became necessary as well as economically and technically feasible, it's thought they could provide an abundance of resources.\nKnowing an asteroid's composition is key for defence reasons too. An iron-rich asteroid, for example would do more damage on impact than carbonaceous ones as it is more dense, has more mass and would have more energy if it smashed into a moon or planet. The Earth's Moon, as can be seen, is littered by asteroid impact craters since it only has a thin atmosphere, or exosphere, which cannot protective it. Although the Earth is unlikely to receive an impact by YR4, there remains a 1.7% chance it could hit our Moon.\nThe level of damage also depends on the asteroid's structure. \"If you know more about the structure of these objects,\" says Fitzsimmons, \"then you can calculate more accurately what happens when it hits the Earth's atmosphere.Most asteroids below 10km [6.2 miles] across are almost all either heavily fractured solid objects or rock piles \u2013 smaller fragments of asteroids grouped together mostly by gravity.\"\nDoes this mean a rubble pile asteroid would be more likely to burn up in the atmosphere and therefore be less dangerous? \"Unfortunately not,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"If an asteroid is hitting the Earth at 17km per second (over 38,000 mph), it's in the atmosphere for less than 10 seconds before it reaches impact.\"\nWhile the Earth's atmosphere acts as a protective barrier, that still doesn't prevent all damage. \"Something the size of YR4 would probably only make it to a few kilometres above the Earth's surface. It will lose its energy and explode at altitude. Although we wouldn't get a crater, we would have an air blast and that could be just as devastating as if it hit the ground,\" says Fitzsimmons.\u00a0\nAt the moment we don't know if YR4 is one solid object or whether it's a rock pile, but an air blast could have been significant considering what happened in 2013. A fireball \u2013 which is what an asteroid is called once it enters Earth's atmosphere \u2013 exploded about 14 miles (22.5km) above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia. Eyewitnesses described the light as brighter than the Sun, and the blast's shockwave damaged over 4,000 buildings and injured 1,200 people.\n\"The asteroid was around 20m (66ft) in size,\" says K\u00fcppers. \"This is maybe about the limit size where you would start worrying if it hits populated areas.\"\nCoincidentally, on the day of the Chelyabinsk event, a United Nations committee was underway in Vienna about defending Earth from future asteroid impacts. The meeting resulted in the International Asteroid Warning Network, chaired by Nasa, and a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group for space agencies around the world to collaborate.\nFortunately, there have already been a number of missions which have studied asteroids, starting with Galileo when it flew past two asteroids in the early 1990s. In 2000, Nasa's Near Shoemaker became the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid, Eros, and \u2013 a year later \u2013 to land on one too. The Japanese Huyabusa 2 mission visited the C-type asteroid 162173\u00a0Ryugu in 2018 and 2019 and even sent back a sample to Earth in a hermetically sealed container in 2005.\nThe US OSIRIS-REx mission (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security\u2013Regolith Explorer) collected dust and rocks from asteroid Bennu and returned them to Earth in 2023. Earlier this year, the first in-depth analysis of the samples' minerals and molecules were published. It included finding 14 of the 20 amino acids used by life to make proteins on Earth. The spacecraft, renamed OSIRIS-APEX, is now on its way to explore asteroid Apophis.\u00a0\nAll these missions, and more, have allowed scientists to study the composition and particle size of several asteroids, as well as the magnetic properties of samples to inform our understanding of the Solar System's early magnetic field. But there is another reason for studying asteroids, brought home by the concerns over YR4: to protect our planet.\nIn 2022, Nasa's Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission deliberately aimed itself at a harmless \u2013 from the Earth's point of view \u2013 binary asteroid system consisting of asteroid Didymos (780m, or 2,559 ft) and its smaller orbiting asteroid or moonlet, Dimorphos (160m, or 525ft). The spacecraft used itself as a kinetic impactor, targeting Dimorphos at around 22,530km (14,000 miles) per hour. This was Nasa's first test to see if it could deflect an asteroid's path and it was a success. After impact, Dimorphos' orbit was altered. Does this mean, in future, that Nasa asteroid missions will focus on planetary defence rather than understanding more about the science?\u00a0\n\"We're very much interested in both,\" says Fast, \"and it's a really good partnership. The planetary defence coordination office at Nasa sits inside of the planetary science division because there is so much asteroid science involved in it. We want to protect the planet but we also want to study these amazing leftovers from the formation of the Solar System, both to understand the history of the Solar System and to see what the effects might be should they impact, or should we need to deflect one in space.\"\n* This article was first published on 14 March 2025.

They are also hard-wearing, which means they can be drained and recovered to play football on. \nHowever, most of these pitches - which are used predominantly in the men's Premier League - are made up of 95% sand and 4-5% polyethylene fibres to help reduce waterlogging. \nWomen's Super League teams use a variety of grounds across the season but all pitches meet the minimum elite standards required by the league licence. \nBrighton's Broadfield Stadium is one of the only natural grass surfaces in the WSL, with most clubs playing on a hybrid pitch. \nArsenal, Aston Villa and Leicester City use their male counterparts' stadiums as their main home pitch, as well as occasionally playing at secondary grounds.\nWest Ham were the only WSL club not to play a match at their men's team stadium last season. \nThe Bescot Stadium - home of League Two Walsall FC - is used for Villa's matches in the Women's League Cup and FA Cup and was recently renovated.\nCrystal Palace, who earned promotion from the Women's Championship, play the majority of their matches on the VBS Community Stadium and the pitch was replaced with a new hybrid surface this season. \nAnd Leicester City's second pitch - Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium - is an artificial grass pitch and is only used when there are scheduling clashes.\nBrighton Women play some WSL matches at the Amex Stadium\nWhile little research has been carried out regarding pitches for female athletes specifically, plenty of data has been gathered in football generally. \nEverything from traction, the hardness of the surface, how high the ball bounces, how far the ball rolls and shock absorption have been looked into. \nNeil Rodger, the principal consultant at STRI Group - a company working in the development of sports surfaces - admitted more research was needed to see if there was any link to increased injury risk in female footballers and certain pitches.\n\"It's never been broken down into men's football and women's football. We've always just designed football pitches,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"When you think about injuries in the men's or women's game, there are so many factors that contribute - the training load, sleep, physiology, hormones...\n\"The pitch is a factor, it's in the mix. Historically, in the women's and men's game, there have been unsafe pitches. In the modern game, that's not really the case. \n\"Particularly in the Premier League, the pitch quality is exceptional and the grounds teams are very good. There's more research needed to see if there is any link.\"\nRodger said it was unknown if there was \"a very subtle difference between what is optimal for the men's game and what is for the women's game\", but the volume of matches played in shared stadiums was no doubt a contributing factor in reducing the quality of surfaces.\n\"Arsenal Women play a lot of matches at the Emirates and the grounds team will prepare the pitch to the exact same high standard as they would for the men,\" he added. \n\"But whether it's men's or women's, the more games you play on a pitch, the more wear and tear it takes and the more the quality of the pitch is going to be impacted. \n\"More usage means more maintenance needed. That is a factor.\"\nHaving coached in the Women's Super League and on the international stage, West Ham boss Rehanne Skinner has experienced a number of pitch surfaces.\nBut she believed it was not the type of surface, but how you manage the quality of the pitches which was the most important factor to consider. \n\"It's got to be about investment into the quality of the pitch or how you manage stadiums independently to reduce the volume of games on them,\" added Skinner. \n\"We groundshare in a lot of instances and that means the pitches take a lot - TV masks some of it. When you're actually standing on them, they look very different. \n\"I think the bottom line is, it is down to the volume of games on the pitch. That definitely needs to be something that's addressed.\"\nFormer Chelsea and England defender Claire Rafferty suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in her career - and believed the pitch was a contributing factor.\nWhile the 36-year-old admitted it was not something she thought about while playing, Rafferty said the idea that the pitches male players currently play on may not be optimal for women was an \"interesting concept\". \n\"The only limitation is we're trying to improve the standard of the game in general, so do we increase barriers to entry if we have women-only pitches?\" Rafferty told BBC Sport. \n\"When we're looking at grassroots, are we limiting access? Yes, there needs to be research, but there is that argument too.\n\"My ideal pitch would be a grass pitch. If we get into the details of the grass length, that can have an impact as well. \n\"If the grass is too long, then you're at risk of the boots getting stuck and non-contact injuries. But if it's too short and dry then you don't have that balance there.\"\nFormer Scotland international Jen Beattie played at the Emirates Stadium regularly with Arsenal\nFormer Scotland and Arsenal defender Jen Beattie said there were \"so many different factors\" that could contribute to injury, but playing surfaces should not be the primary focus.\nThree major names, Vivianne Miedema, Beth Mead and Leah Williamson, suffered ACL injuries while playing for the Gunners, and Chelsea striker Sam Kerr is not expected back until April 2025 after being sidelined since January 2024.\n\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing and I think separating men and women and playing on different pitches just makes the games go even further apart rather than looking at other things that I think are more important,\" Beattie told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"If we're talking about ACLs, that comes from more conditioning and physicality. There needs to be more research into women's health because we are just different.\n\"That's a proven fact. The priority needs to be looking at that rather than playing on different pitches. I've no idea how logistically that would work.\"\nA number of clubs now track players' menstrual cycles following recent studies linking periods to ACL injuries. \nThere has also been research carried out by organisations such as the European Club Association (ECA) on how varying footwear can contribute to injury risk.\n\"I think there needs to be more research specifically for women,\" said ex-England striker Ellen White, who suffered an ACL injury during her career.\n\"Women are built slightly differently with childbearing hips, or you are on your period, so your ligaments are slightly looser.\n\"But I feel there needs to be more research into exactly why certain movements happen or more strength and conditioning to help with the muscles in and around the knee.\n\"I was unlucky, I went for a couple of challenges and my knee just gave out. I don't think there was an overarching reason why. It was just luck of the draw.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "Which hobbies are best for meeting new people? Molly Gorman tested four of them \u2013 and discovered surprising facts about how and why we bond as a species.\nWalking into a busy climbing gym in London on a Friday night, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Desperately gazing past the staff at the reception desk, my eyes lock onto the sea of chalk-covered hands and limbs swinging between multi-coloured holds \u2013 all around five metres (16ft) above crash mats.\u00a0\nI am here as part of an experiment for our ongoing BBC series exploring the science \u2013 and art \u2013 of friendship. Cultivating friendships is key to our wellbeing, and to living a long life. As we mature and become more agreeable, it can actually get easier to form and maintain friendships. But where do you start?\nLondon is a city of nearly nine million people, but like anywhere, it can still be lonely. And without opportunities to mingle, it can be hard to try out and develop different friendship skills and strategies.\nFinding a hobby may seem an obvious way to foster social connection \u2013 in fact, research suggests that bonding through hobbies is a uniquely human trait. However, given the huge range of potential clubs, classes and activities, which one is actually best for making friends? And is there scientific evidence that some activities have more social potential than others?\nTo find out, I tested three new activities, and one existing hobby for comparison, and also explored the evidence-backed benefits they might offer. I chose a range of activities, from sports to art, across different budgets. For full transparency, I decided to mention the cost of each activity \u2013 since choosing a hobby can also be a matter of affordability. Here's what I found:\nIn late 2020, I moved to London from the countryside. Seeking to make friends in my local area as well as shape some kind of exercise routine, I decided to join a recreational netball league, which is perfect for those who may be more interested in the social aspect of a team sport, as opposed to the competitiveness.\nI soon found a wonderful team and we have now played together for four years. Every Monday evening, rain or shine, we take to the court, but we also meet up outside of the sport \u2013 whether that's for a drink after a match or dinner on the weekend.\nIf you are not naturally into ball games, this activity may not feel worth trying out \u2013 but research suggests that team sports can have huge benefits for people of all ages and all abilities. Inclusive sports can for example improve the wellbeing of children with disabilities by providing them with the opportunity to \"form friendships, express creativity, develop a self-identity and foster a meaning and purpose in life\".\nAccording to Arran Davis, an expert on social connection and health at the University of Oxford, in the UK, collaborative activities like team sports can not only make exercise feel easier, but can help us build social relationships. \u00a0\n\"There's a couple of ways that could happen: the first is just doing stuff together. So what psychologists call 'sharing intention',\" he says. This term refers to the phenomenon of connecting over or talking about a common goal or action. As Davis puts it, it's the sense of: \"'I think about what you're thinking about, you think about what I'm thinking about'.\"\nShared intention \"makes us feel a bit closer to one another and that can lead us to view one another as good cooperative partners or people that we feel more similar to\", he says. \"And these are the things that build friendships\u2026 through coordinating or collaborating, we're able to signal to each other that we're friends,\" he explains.\nDavis goes on to explain how endorphins and other natural chemicals released in the body when we do aerobic exercise, for example the feeling of \"runner's high\", can be enhanced when we're working in a team. \"Interestingly, these chemicals are also involved in primate bonding. When primates groom each other, they release endorphins, or when we laugh together, we release endorphins,\" he says. \"So this gives us a positive feeling that we then start to associate with the people around us. It can be a way to build connection through sharing a positive psychological state.\"\nA 2023 study compared social bonding between humans, and between other primates. It concluded that there may be something unique about the way we as humans bond through shared experiences, whether it's taking a walk together, dancing together, making music together, playing team sports or even just having a conversation. While positive social bonds are generally important for all primates, our special ability as humans to connect through shared, interactive experiences may help us learn more about each other, and ultimately coordinate and maintain larger social networks than other primates, according to the study.\nFor adults, team sport participation typically\u00a0declines\u00a0in older age, but research suggests it's never too late.\u00a0One study\u00a0examined the reasons why a group of adults over the age of 55 engage in team sports and found that community and togetherness were an important motivation, as well as the potential health benefits.\nFrom my experience, team sports are fantastic for making friends because not only do you see the same people on a weekly basis, but playing a sport together provides a topic of conversation to discuss and bond over. I have made lifelong friends through netball, and it always brings a burst of joy to my week (even when we lose).\nStill, I was curious about whether adding other activities could help me widen my social circle further \u2013 and reveal insights into our relationship with ourselves, as well as with others. That's how I ended up in the chalk-dusted bouldering gym...\nBouldering is a type of climbing where the route is\u00a0\"short but tricky\"\u00a0and is performed without a harness or ropes. Studies on bouldering and mental health suggest that the sport may have a positive effect on\u00a0symptoms of depression, more so than\u00a0home-based exercise, for example.\u00a0In one study, 133 patients with depression were assigned bouldering psychotherapy for ten weeks \u2013\u00a0the results showed that bouldering alleviated their symptoms. (Of course, depression is a complex condition, and if you are worried about your mental health, you should consult your healthcare provider for advice and support.)\nAs with team sports, the benefits of climbing and bouldering extend across different ages and abilities. Researchers surveying US Veterans and non-Veterans with disabilities found a range of potential therapeutic benefits to adaptive rock and rope climbing, for example, including\u00a0community connection, confidence-building, and muscle strengthening.\nI certainly found that bouldering had a positive effect on my mind. When I was climbing, my sole focus was concentrated on my next move: where my feet needed to go, how to swing my hips to reach the next hold and ensuring I kept a steady grip. Essentially, it felt like problem-solving combined with a physical challenge.\nWhen I was taking a rest and observing groups of climbers in the middle of the mats, both chatting and looking out for fellow climbers on the wall, it also became clear that bouldering is a very social sport \u2013 they were offering support, encouragement and guidance to each other. Climbing gyms host a range of routes at varying difficulty levels, marked by colour, meaning that people with different fitness levels can boulder together.\nI had booked a beginner's bouldering class, where five of us quickly became united in a camaraderie as an instructor guided us through technique, climbing etiquette and safety. After an hour of learning and testing out the routes to see what we could manage with support from our instructor, we were left to our own devices. Our group largely stuck together but it was easy to chat to other climbers.\nThe next day, I woke to achy forearms \u2013 but it was a satisfying pain, as was the satisfying feeling of trying something brand new.\nUnfortunately, the price tag attached to climbing and bouldering is on the higher side \u2013 and some may not be comfortable with the level of risk and potential for injury. That's why I also tested two gentler and cheaper activities: a book club with a creative writing class, and a life-drawing class (which, while physically safe, felt daunting in a different way \u2013 more on this later).\nFriendship series\nAmid the loneliness epidemic blighting many parts of the world following the pandemic, the BBC looks at how friendships can enrich our lives \u2013 and the science-backed ways to boost our social connections:\n\u2022 Why we become better friends as we age \n\u2022 What we can learn from friendship break-ups \n\u2022 How not to be a 'toxic' friend\nWhen you're looking for social connection, does it help to choose an activity that is openly designed to encourage bonding? I tested this out by taking part in a creative writing session in East London. Facilitated by the London Girls Book Club who host a range of events alongside their monthly book club meeting, the session was designed to help people meet other writers, get inspired and have an opportunity to focus on a piece of creative writing.\n\"I've seen so many of the women create best friends through our club,\" says Caitlin Curry, who founded the London Girls Book Club four years ago after she moved to London from north-east England. In her experience, the shared foundation of loving books has enabled women to form strong friendships. \"At the start you might be seeing new faces, or you might see someone every so often, but the more that you come, you start to see similar faces and build those connections,\" she says.\nPsychologists have a name for this kind of bonding by engaging in, and talking about, a shared activity: \"triadic interactions\". In triadic interactions, we pay attention both to each other, and to an object or activity of mutual interest (on the other hand, a dyadic interaction is one where we only focus on each other). Both dyadic and triadic interactions are key to our early development \u2013 and continue to have bonding benefits for adults, research suggests.\nMost of the women attending the session had shown up alone, and everyone was approachable and open. After an introduction and opportunity to meet everyone, we had 30 minutes of quiet time, a break to discuss what we were working on and then a further 30 minutes to write. I did find that our shared interest in reading and writing, along with our shared goals as writers, made it easy to bond, despite being total strangers just an hour before.\nThere are psychological benefits to creative writing, too, research suggests. One study by Plymouth University and Nottingham Trent University in the UK found that writing and discussing poetry as a means to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic helped people to cope with feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as help to reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. A similar study published in 2021 found that creative writing may encourage personal growth and a sense of inner peace.\nBook clubs can also be an affordable way to socialise, especially if you borrow the book from a library. Reading may even have health benefits, such as cognitive benefits, potentially making it another hobby that provides a social as well as physical boost.\nFor anyone who is nervous about joining a book club, Curry offers the reminder that you always have the book in common if you're feeling shy: \"A lot of the women that come are very open, very friendly and they'll do things like follow up with each other\u2026 I provide friendship tips, we have name labels and we swap [around] so that you get to chat to lots of new people.\"\nHaving a class that was structured meant that people felt braver and more open to chatting with others. It can be hard to muster up the courage to start a conversation, so knowing that everyone would get a chance to speak provided a bit of light relief.\u00a0\n\"I can't think of a better place to be an artist than London,\" says Ann Mackowski, artist and founder of Soho Life Drawing, a drawing group that runs weekly drop-in sessions in the heart of central London. Oh, and there's tea and biscuits.\nBefore I attended one of her relaxed life drawing workshops (also known as figure drawing), I would have told you that I am awful at sketching or drawing. Really awful.\nUnfortunately, I'd say the same thing now. But my skill level didn't matter.\nDrawing, especially when done in a way that makes us focus on the world around us, can improve mood and wellbeing, research suggests. As I quietly focused on sketching, it felt incredibly calming. I left the session feeling relaxed and proud that I was able to even sketch the outline of a body.\nAs with the other activities I tried out, I discovered that life drawing offered a surprising additional benefit beyond the promise of social connection: it can have a positive impact on body image. One study showed how it just took six weeks of classes to notice feelings of body pride and elevation. Another study showed that for women in particular, greater attendance of life drawing classes was associated with higher body appreciation, as well as and a lower drive for thinness and social physique anxiety.\nThe workshop consisted of sketching a naked person in different poses, accompanied by guidance from Mackowski through the first hour. After a break where we chatted amongst us (with aforementioned tea and biscuits), the session resumed with longer poses for the second hour. Mackowski created a friendly, safe and tranquil space for all, regardless of skill level. Some people were gently reintroducing themselves to life-drawing, others trying something brand new, others had been honing their skills for years.\n\"You get people coming in, they make friends, they come back,\" says Mackowski, adding that the connections people form through her classes has been one of the reasons why she's continued running them for many years. \"It becomes like a little family for some people. Then they might go to other classes together and venture out.\"\nIn fact, in a 2021 survey in the UK on the arts and social connectedness, 82% of participants responded that engagement in the arts was linked with feelings of social connection, belonging and collective understanding.\nMackowski adds that having an artistic community can help people both socially and from a technical standpoint: \"People develop their skills a lot quicker if they can see other people's work\u2026 and identify styles. So if you're in a room with 30 people and you can view their work, beginners get a good idea of where to go. And it's known to increase levels of creativity.\" At the end of our session, there was an opportunity to share your finished work with peers or Mackowski for feedback.\nIn terms of my original quest \u2013 to find out which activity would be best for making friends \u2013 all the ones I tried were a success. Each formed a gateway to a community and new friends, while offering other benefits I hadn't even thought about when starting this mission.\nEmbarking on a new hobby is, of course, just a first step \u2013 it may not be an instant solution to the widespread problem of social isolation and loneliness and the search for social connection. Still, my experience alongside the research on how we as a species bond through shared activities, suggests that it's worth trying out a new activity where you might meet people with similar interests to you. In fact, at the start of this year, 19% of Americans made a New Year's resolution related to a hobby or a skill, according to a poll by the American Psychiatric Association.\nIf you're not sure how to break the ice, here's an opening line I used several times when talking to my fellow boulderers, writers and aspiring artists: \"Have you ever done this before?\" Admittedly, it may not be the world's greatest or most eloquent \u2013 but it did the job of getting us chatting. And for me at least, that awkward small talk quickly led to genuinely enjoyable conversations \u2013 and shared moments of connection.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Of course, part of us is leaving. When Vincent or Sergio or David left, these players have contributions.\n\"He's one of the greatest in this country. Always I have to be careful for the respect for the players that have played incredible roles, but there's no doubt he's one of the greatest for sure.\n\"The doors are open here for the rest of his life.

        "article_text": "Susan was no more than puzzled when she saw the first results from her home DNA testing kit.\nNow a woman in her mid 70s, she had never known much about her grandfather, and paid for the private test to see if it threw up anything unusual.\n\"I did notice there was a lot of Irish heritage, which as far as I knew was wrong,\" she says.\n\"But I just pushed it aside and didn't think any more of it. I stopped paying for my subscription and that was that.\"\nExcept it very much wasn't.\nIt took another six years for Susan - not her real name - to realise everything she knew about her family history was wrong.\nShe later found out that back in the 1950s, she had been swapped at birth for another baby girl in a busy NHS maternity ward.\nHer case is now the second of its type uncovered by the BBC. Lawyers say they expect more to come forward driven by the boom in cheap genetic testing and ancestry websites.\nA sharp, funny woman with shoulder-length white hair, Susan tells me her story from her sunny front room somewhere in southern England.\nHer husband is sitting next to her, jogging her memory and chipping in from time to time.\nAfter taking that DNA test almost a decade ago, the genealogy company entered her data into its vast family tree, allowing other users to make contact with their genetic relatives \u2013 close or distant.\nSix years later she received a message out of the blue.\nThe stranger said that his data matched hers in a way that could only mean one thing: he must be her genetic sibling.\n\"That was just panic. It was every emotion I could think of, my brain was all over the place,\" she says.\nSusan's first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother.\nHe was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant.\nSusan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family.\nHer eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born.\nThe next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website.\nIt couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago.\nUntil recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries.\nThe standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay.\nIn the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives.\n\"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan.\n\"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\"\nFrom the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS.\nThis, of course, meant nothing to Susan for decades.\nShe grew up as part of a \"normal, working class\" household, met her husband and ended up working for the NHS herself in a \"hands-on\" clinical role.\nOther than \"a bit of the usual trauma\" in her teenage years, she remembers her parents as a \"very good, loving\" couple who \"did everything they could and always encouraged me\".\n\"In a way, I'm so glad they are not here anymore to see this,\" says Susan. \"If they are up there watching me, I really hope they don't know what's gone on.\"\nIf home DNA tests had been available earlier, she doesn't think she could have told them the truth \"because it would have been so awful\".\n\"But I really don't think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,\" she says.\nOn the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she's gone through.\n\"It's actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to 'my dear sister',\" she says.\n\"Both he and his wife have been absolutely fantastic, honestly I cannot praise them enough.\"\nShe remembers receiving another \"lovely letter\" from a cousin at the time who told her, \"Oh don't worry, you're still part of the family\".\nAs for her new blood relations, she says the situation has been more difficult.\nShe has met up with the man who contacted her, her biological sibling, and laughs as she remembers how similar they both looked.\n\"If you'd put a wig on him and a bit of makeup, it could honestly have been me,\" she jokes.\nShe has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons.\nBut building a relationship with that new side of her family has not been easy.\n\"I know they are my biological relatives but I didn't grow up with them so there's not that emotional connection there,\" she says.\n\"They closed ranks, basically, through loyalty to their sister which is admirable and I understand.\"\nSusan's genetic parents died some years ago but she's been told she looks like her biological mother.\n\"I'd still like to know a bit more about her \u2013 what she was like and all that \u2013 but I never will, so there you go,\" she says.\n\"But if I take the emotion out of it, and just think logically and clearly, I was better off how I grew up.\"\nSusan is one of the first to ever receive compensation - the amount is not being disclosed - in a case like this.\nShe needed to take a second DNA test before the NHS trust involved accepted its historic mistake and made a \"very lovely\" apology.\nLast year, the BBC reported on another decades-old case of babies swapped at birth, which again came to light after someone was given a DNA testing kit for Christmas.\nSusan says the settlement was never about money but the recognition a mistake had been made all those years ago.\n\"I suppose you always want someone to blame, don't you?\" she asks.\n\"But I know this will be with me for the rest of my life. I just wanted a conclusion.\"",

        "article_text": "Rural North Yorkshire is having its Hollywood moment. \nThe latest production to be filmed in the region is a new adaptation of the classic novel Wuthering Heights, which has just finished shooting in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\nIt stars Australian actress Margot Robbie, who recently took the lead role in Barbie, and will play Cathy alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff.\nEmily Bronte's novel was written in 1847 and set in the rugged Yorkshire moors.\nThe locations chosen for the new film included Arkengarthdale, Swaledale and the village of Low Row. Robbie, 35, stayed at the hotel Simonstone Hall, near Hawes, with other cast members.\nShe was also photographed in a white wedding gown surrounded by film crew for a scene believed to be her marriage to Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton.\nFashion bible Vogue has criticised her dress as being historically inaccurate, as the style was only popularised by Queen Victoria 40 years after the story is set.\nThe hotel is a \"historic country lodge\" where presenter Jeremy Clarkson famously got into a fight with a Top Gear producer in 2015. \nA staff member said Robbie was \"very lovely\" and even enjoyed a Sunday roast and afternoon tea there with her husband and new baby. \nThe employee told the BBC: \"The weekend was great fun, where she met lots of other guests and visitors and she introduced her baby to the resident pigs and peacocks here.\" \nThe film crew's base camp was near Holiday Home Yorkshire in Reeth, whose owner said it was \"very exciting\" seeing the trailers in the tiny village. \nOne local holiday let owner said he saw Robbie driving a tractor with her co-star - although the agricultural vehicles were not invented until the late 19th Century.\nHe said: \"There were four tractors, old-fashioned open-to-the-elements style and they were being escorted by two Range Rovers.\"\nAnother Dales resident said he had seen filming at Surrender Bridge, which is close to an old lead smelting mill. The landmark also featured in the opening scene of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small in the 1980s and is on the Coast to Coast path route.\nCrew members also stayed at the Charles Bathurst Inn, in Arkengarthdale, and were described as \"very friendly\". \nThe film, directed by Emerald Fennell, is due for release in February 2026. \nThere are hopes that it will lead to an upsurge in interest in the Bronte sisters and their work.\nThe director of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, a literary museum located at the former Bronte family home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, said: \"Every screen or theatre adaptation brings something fresh for contemporary audiences to think about. \n\"It is a testimony of Emily's legacy that her writing continues to inspire creatives today and we look forward to seeing what Emerald Fennell's adaptation adds to the mix.\" \nHaworth Parsonage is where Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights and lived with her sisters Charlotte and Anne, and it was gifted to the Bronte Society in 1928. \nIt has the largest collection of Bront\u00eb items in the world. \nDirector Rebecca Yorke added: \"We're also delighted that some filming has taken place at nearby locations and hope that this will attract new visitors to the area and to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum.\" \nThere have been at least 10 film and television adaptations of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel. \nOne of the most well-known was the 1939 version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nOther high-profile actors who have played Heathcliff over the years include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Richard Burton. \nMeanwhile, North Yorkshire was also the filming location for a Christmas film starring Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland. \nTinsel Town will be released in December 2025 and was shot in Knaresborough.\nWilson, 45, said at the time she \"loved\" the area and had been practising her Yorkshire accent. \nIn 2021, Tom Cruise surprised locals of Pickering when he touched down in a helicopter to shoot scenes for Mission: Impossible at a heritage railway. \nThe owner of a local B&B said in a Facebook post they had been walking the dog when they \"bumped into\" the Hollywood megastar.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

        "article_text": "Mountain gorilla conservation in Rwanda is a global success story, partly due to the significance and value placed on gorillas as part of the nation's culture and heritage, with annual celebrations of baby gorillas being born.\nIn a sunlit spot of mist-cloaked rainforest, a black, hairy mass of muscle descends surprisingly gracefully down a thick mossy vine. The huge silverback stretches out and settles in for a thorough grooming session from a female, totally unfazed by his human admirers. Two teenagers tumble into view, beating their chests and grimacing at each other, a tangle of limbs in mock combat, while an adorable baby gorilla peers shyly from her mother's arms at the unfolding family drama.\nSeeing mountain gorillas in the wild is a magical bucket list experience, but it wasn't always this way. Poachers decimated gorilla numbers in the 1960s and 70s, leaving them at risk of extinction. Then came the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Volcanoes National Park, home to most of Rwanda's mountain gorillas, became a battlefield as the civil war raged across the country, with population numbers struggling to rise above 300.\u00a0\nIt's hard to fathom how Rwanda has managed to tackle the challenges of its traumatic past in such a short space of time, let alone become a beacon of conservation success. Yet today, mountain gorillas are the only great ape whose numbers are not rapidly descending. WWF estimates that mountain gorilla numbers have risen 3% every year since 2010, moving them in the right direction from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species \u2013 and this success largely comes down to Rwanda's sustained conservation efforts, which include anti-poaching patrols, community engagement and regulated gorilla tourism, all of which have helped to protect habitats and ensure that local people benefit from the survival of these great apes.\nThree hundred and ninety-five baby gorillas have been born since 2005 in Rwanda, and each year since then these new arrivals have been celebrated in a uniquely Rwandan way. Kwita Izina, or \"to give a name\" in the country's national Kinyarwanda language, is Rwanda's huge annual gorilla naming ceremony that honours each gorgeous fuzzy baby born in Volcanoes National Park with a meaningful moniker. The ceremony, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is inspired by the centuries-old Rwandan tradition where families and communities would gather together to name their newborns. Since Kwita Izina began, it has played a major role in raising awareness of gorilla conservation.\n\"It's a great story of success to mark this progress of a species that was in decline and on the edge,\" says Praveen Moman, founder of Volcanoes Safaris and the first international tour operator to kickstart gorilla tourism in Rwanda after the genocide. \"First it was small and local and symbolic, just for the rangers and those involved in conservation. Now the government has made this an international and recognisable event to highlight conservation success.\"\nRwandans place great significance on a person's name, and so the button-cute babies are given names based on their personality or events surrounding them at the time of their birth. Last year actor Idris Elba named a baby gorilla \"Narame\", meaning \"long life\", because its mother had previously lost two children; and primary school student Elvine Ineza named a female baby \"Nibagwire\", meaning \"multiply\" and chosen to wish the newly formed Sigasirie family continued growth.\nTens of thousands of people, including celebrities, conservationists and local communities, now come together at the foothills of the ancient volcanoes for the annual spectacle held every autumn (the confirmed date for 2025 has yet to be announced by the Rwanda Development Board). As well as the official ceremony, dominated by a house-high bamboo gorilla sculpture, there are hours of music, dances and performances from the warrior-like Intore dancers pounding the ground in time to drums to cultural villages showcasing Rwandan daily life.\nAs well as raising global awareness, Kwita Izina is also a cultural celebration of the country's collective efforts to protect the great apes and a way of saying thank you to the communities and conservationists who protect them. Irene Murerwa, chief tourism officer of the Rwanda Development Board tells the BBC that Kwita Izina serves the purpose of thanking the local community before everything else. \"It's because of the community and it's for them as well,\" she says.\nTiming a visit to Volcanoes National Park during Kwita Izina is highly worthwhile, but the meaning behind it is really what's key, according to Murerwa. \"It's not just the baby gorilla naming ceremony. It's the whole aspect of visiting. Guests can take advantage to understand how communities, tourism and conservation come together here,\" she says.\nA dramatic blend of striking volcanic mountains, ethereal montane forests and neat, terraced hills that roll endlessly across the countryside, Rwanda is tiny but one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Space is limited, so people living near the gorillas must have incentives to protect them. \"If you want to save the gorillas you need to focus on the people, because these are tiny, fragile habitats, surrounded by some of the most densely populated areas of the world,\" says Moman.\nPlan your trip\nHow to get here:\n Fly into Rwanda's capital Kigali. From Kigali, it takes between two to three hours to drive to Volcanoes National Park's headquarters in Kinigi, Musanze, where the naming ceremony is also held. Lodges usually provide transfers or car hire and taxi services are available.\nWhen to go:\n The long dry season between May and October. Kwita Izina is usually held every autumn.\nWhere to stay\n: \nVirunga Lodge\n, \nWilderness Sabyinyo\n and \nRed Rocks Rwanda.    \nWhat to do:\n Gorillas are the star attraction but golden monkeys are also endemic here (permits are needed for both). If visiting during the week-long Kwita Izina festivities, organise tickets through your lodge or tour operator.\n\"Unless local people see some specific benefit from tourism and conservation, there's no reason why they should support the future of the gorillas, and equally importantly, the future of the habitat. What they need is farmland and bread on the table. From the small number of visitors, you need to make enough of an impact through the income and make sure that some of it is shared with the community.\"\nMore than 1.4 million travellers visited Rwanda in 2023, generating a record US$620m. At $1,500 per permit, watching gorillas is an eye-wateringly expensive experience. Yet, income from gorilla tourism provides vital funding for the continued protection of the park and animals within and, crucially, 10% of the park fee revenue goes to the people who live around the park margins to help build schools and houses, improve infrastructure and sanitation, provide clean water and support health centres. This impactful funding has transformed villages and encourages stewardship of the forests.\nTourism now also provides thousands of people with livelihoods. Greg Bakunzi, founder of Red Rocks Rwanda, a social enterprise integrating tourism, conservation and sustainable community development in and around the Volcanoes National Park, says, \"Kwita Izina helped to mobilise communities and people who were interested in conservation and tourism to be a part of the growing tourism industry.\"\nRed Rocks Rwanda offers safari tent accommodation, gorilla trekking and many immersive activities throughout the year for visitors, and Bakunzi now also hosts the annual Red Rocks Cultural Festival that aligns with the dates of Kwita Izina and features music, poetry, comedy, art, exhibitions and talks about conservation and community empowerment.\n\"I wanted to create a week-long event that could also integrate community conservation when travellers come for the naming ceremony,\" he says. \"The culture of the communities are intricately tied to the natural world surrounding them. They preserve not only the Virungu Mountain environment but also the historical cultures and traditional arts of the region, gaining access to sustainable sources of income from tourism.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Where people go to bars to drink milk\n\u2022 Is there such a thing as guilt-free safari?\n\u2022 The West African nation welcoming the world\nOver at the Gorilla Guardians Village in the small town of Kinigi, which is also home to the park headquarters, former poachers have swapped snares for stories. Visitors can immerse themselves in Rwandan dance, craft and food, make Rwanda's potent banana beer, learn traditional skills like fire-making and archery and hear the tales of the people who used to hunt in the forest. Also in Kinigi, upscale Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge is Rwanda's first community-owned lodge. The pretty stone cottages and access to gorilla trekking provide an income for many local people and also support healthcare, infrastructure and education projects, such as building homes for widows of the Rwandan genocide and new classrooms for children.\nEunice Umumararungu, assistant manager at Sabyinyo, told me, \"Everyone's job is vital to successful conservation. From the porters, trackers and guides to research partners, rangers and those who are involved in the tree planting initiatives \u2013 they are all ensuring future naming ceremonies as the gorilla population grows thanks to conservation efforts. Kwita Izina has helped all Rwandans from various communities to understand the value of gorillas and their contribution to the country's economic prosperity.\"\nCementing the region as a conservation hub is the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, which opened in 2022 just outside the park. As well as being an education and research centre for the next generation of conservation leaders, visitors can take quizzes to find out which gorilla matches their personality, leaf through Fossey's field notes in a highly realistic version of the acclaimed primatologist's research camp and explore 12 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds.\nGorilla families are doing so well now that Volcanoes National Park is being expanded to give them more space. In addition, a Conservation Master Plan, published later this year, will set out guidance for the protection and management of all Rwandan biodiversity. As people are seen as important stewards of conservation in this nation, those who will have to relocate out of the expanded national park will be supported with new livelihood opportunities and improved living conditions.\n\"Kwita Izina has really put our name on the map,\" says Bakunzi. \"It has brought us more global visibility and has shown people why conservation matters.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Authorities in India's Kuno National Park have started disciplinary action against a forest worker who is seen offering water to a cheetah and her cubs in a video that has gone viral online.\nThe man, a driver at the sanctuary, violated instructions which say only authorised personnel can go near the big cats, park officials told PTI news agency.\nCheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952, the only large mammal to become extinct since the country's independence. \nThey were reintroduced in Kuno in 2022 as part of an ambitious plan to repopulate the species.\nThe incident came to light on Sunday, when a video of the man feeding water to the big cats began circulating online. \nThe footage shows him pouring water into a metal pan after being urged to do so by some people who aren't seen in the video.\nMoments later, a cheetah named Jwala and her four cubs walk up to the pan and start drinking from it. \nOfficials say it's not uncommon for certain staff members to offer water to big cats if they get close to the boundary of the national park to lure them back into the forest.\nThe mum and her cubs were in the fields close to the boundary, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI. \n\"The monitoring team, in general, has been instructed to try to deviate or lure the cheetahs back inside whenever such a situation arises so as not to create human-cheetah conflict,\" he said\nHowever, only trained personnel are allowed to do so and the man's actions went against established protocol, he added.\n\"There are clear instructions to move away from cheetahs. Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa.

Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.Villages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Officials say it's not uncommon for certain staff members to offer water to big cats if they get close to the boundary of the national park to lure them back into the forest.The mum and her cubs were in the fields close to the boundary, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.",

        "article_text": "Asia-Pacific stocks from Shanghai to Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong plunged on Monday by levels not seen in decades, as global markets continue to reel from US President Donald Trump's tariffs.  \nThe Shanghai Composite was down more than 8% at one point, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped more than 13% and Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down by 7.8% - moves that one analyst described to the BBC as a \"bloodbath\".\nEuropean markets too fell in early trading, with banks and defence firms seeing the biggest drops. This follows global slumps last week after Trump announced new tariffs between 10% and 46% on most countries. \nThis is a blow for Asia's manufacturing hubs that count the US as a key market for exports ranging from clothes to cars. \nThese include wealthy allies like Japan and South Korea, which face 26% tariffs, as well as developing countries like Vietnam that are bracing for a 46% levy - Trump called the fast-growing economy one of the \"worst offenders\". \nAlso on that unenviable list are Cambodia (49%), Thailand (36%) and China, which will face 54% tariffs in total. \nOthers like Singapore, New Zealand and Australia have already had a so-called baseline 10% tariff go into effect. \n\"Asia is bearing the brunt of the US tariff hike. While there could be some room for negotiation, a new regime of higher tariffs is here to stay,\" Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist at investment firm Vanguard.\nAsian economies are also particularly sensitive to fears that a global trade war could trigger a slowdown or even a recession in the US, the world's biggest economy. That, in turn, would further hurt Asian exports. \nSlumps in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were exacerbated as investors caught up with the big falls seen in other markets on Friday as they were closed for public holidays.\nThe Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7% - its biggest drop on record.\nThe ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2% and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower.\nThe Hang Seng closed at 13.22%, its biggest drop since 2008. \n\"Tariffs are feeding into expectations around inflation and a recession,\" said Julia Lee, head of client coverage at FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.\nGoldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the US will fall into recession in the next 12 months - up from a previous estimate of 35% - as the investment banking giant lowered its economic growth forecast for the country.\nOther Wall Street firms have also revised their recession forecasts in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a US and global economic downturn.\n\"This is negative to the global and Asia economy, especially those small open economies, both in the short term and long-term.\"\nCountries from Vietnam to Bangladesh have become highly reliant on the US as an export market.\nSeveral major US brands produce goods in Vietnam, including Nike and Gap.\nBangladesh exports $8.4bn (\u00a36.5bn) of garments a year to the US, according to the trade body, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. \nSo Trump's announcement last week of a 37% tariff on Bangladesh is bad news for the South Asian nation.\n\"Asia is likely to feel a disproportionate brunt of this turmoil because Asia sends more exports to the US than to other markets,\" said Frank Lavin,  former undersecretary for international trade at the US Department of Commerce.\nAsia's biggest economy, China, has also hit back with its own tariffs, deepening the global stock market turmoil on Friday.\nAll three major US stock indexes in fell by more than 5%, with the S&P 500 dropping almost 6%, capping the worst week for the US stock market since 2020.\nIn the UK, the FTSE 100 plunged almost 5% - its steepest fall in five years, while exchanges in Germany and France faced similar declines.\nMs Lee also highlighted that the global stock market rout looks set to continue: \"US futures trading lower point to another hard session on Wall Street tonight.\"\nGlobal stock markets have lost trillions in value since Trump announced sweeping new 10% import taxes on goods from every country, with products from dozens of countries, including key trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam, facing far higher rates.\nAdditional reporting by Annabelle Liang",

        "article_text": "Sam was lying in bed one morning when her tenant in a house she owned in Margate sent her a photo of a piece of graffiti that had appeared on the wall outside.\nAstonishingly, it looked like a Banksy. It would turn out to be perhaps the graffiti artist's most interesting new artwork of recent years,\u202fValentine's Day Mascara (pictured above), which was revealed in Margate on Valentine's Day, 2023.\nBamboozled, Sam googled: what do you do when you wake up with a Banksy on your wall?\n\"What did Google say about that?\" I asked her.\n\"Nothing! And I was like, I need to contact the council, I need to find an art gallery who can advise me.\"\nSam called Julian Usher at Red Eight Gallery. Julian's team, conscious that new Banksys are under immediate threat from street cleaners, the weather, rival graffiti artists and other art dealers, promised he'd be in Margate within the hour: \"We knew we had to get the piece covered,\" say Julian.\nAnd there was another reason Julian got to Margate double-quick: if Banksy chooses your wall for one of his drawings, you could be seriously in the money.\nFor the second season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast The Banksy Story, which is called When Banksy Comes To Town, I've been following the very different fates of two sets of homeowners who wake up one day to find a Banksy on their wall. The season shows just how important his graffiti becomes for a local community \u2013 and why people disagree so vehemently about what should happen after it's discovered.\nSam became the custodian of\u202fValentine's Day Mascara, which speaks to the theme of domestic violence, incidents of which usually spike each Valentine's Day. It's a complicated bit of work. A peppy 50s housewife with a black eye has bludgeoned her partner. A real pan with flecks of red is at her feet, and his painted legs are upended into the real fridge-freezer that Banksy left by the wall. A broken plastic chair testifies to the fight they have had.\nLater on the day it appeared, refuse collectors arrived to spirit away the fridge-freezer. This precipitated a free-for-all, with the public helping themselves to the remnants. It was mayhem. \nA media scrum, a wrong-footed local council, millions of global onlookers. Exactly, one suspects, what Banksy wanted. \nAnd this time, just for laughs, he left behind oil painter Peter Brown, commissioned to capture the scenes he would miss. I spoke to Pete \"The Street\" Brown for my series. \"The whole reason I was employed was because Banksy was questioning what was the art about,\" Pete explained. \"Is it about the graffiti? Or is it about the reaction afterwards, and what happens to it?\"\nAs luck would have it, Pete was captured on video just as Banksy's team were putting the finishing touches to Valentine's Day Mascara \u2013 a video that The Banksy Story managed to obtain. In it we can see that one of Banksy's team let a local kid play with their drone. \n\"They're in the process of putting a large piece on a wall and yet they're taking the time to teach a kid how to fly a drone,\" says Steph Warren, who used to work with Banksy and who appeared in my first series - about the artist's rise and rise. \"Very sweet!\"\nAlongside Sam, I've been following the story of Gert and Gary. They, like Sam, did not want me to use their last name. A 30ft-high seagull appeared one morning on the wall of their buy-to-let in Lowestoft in Suffolk. The bird needed to be massive for Banksy's ambitious visual gag to work. The artist had shoved large yellow insulation strips into a skip that now looked like a fast-food container that the seagull divebombed to steal chips.\nBanksy had chosen his wall well. Visitors arriving by train were treated to this witty meditation on the scourge of Britain's seaside towns, equal parts warning and celebration. The\u202fLowestoft Seagull\u202fwas part of Banksy's\u202fGreat British Staycation, his post-Covid lockdown campaign to cheer us all up at the prospect of a summer holiday spent in the UK.\nBut Gert was not cheered-up at all. \"It's not a seagull, it's an albatross!\" she quipped when I went to interview her.\n\"How did you know it was a Banksy?\" I asked.\n\"There was scaffolding erected on the side of the house. I tried to find out if it was a particular scaffolding firm, but there was no phone number,\" Gert replied. \"On the Monday morning the letting agency informed me that I could possibly have a Banksy. By then the scaffolding had gone and this seagull appeared.\"\nThis fits with what we know of Banksy's modus operandi. He claims hiding in plain sight is the best way to remain invisible. \"If questioned about your legitimacy,\" he wrote in his book Wall & Piece, \"simply complain about the hourly rate.\"\nIt's a good gag. But how fun is it for the folk on the other end of his spray can?\nI found that with good hustling skills a Banksied homeowner might see their bank balance expanded, but it's not an easy process. \nAs Gert explains, exasperated, \"Lowestoft people commented that it belongs to Lowestoft\u2026 But nobody's turned up to say, 'we'll help you protect it'. It doesn't belong to the person filming it, or the person taking pictures with their children. The problem is mine!\" \nGert had to contend with people putting their children into the skip for photo opportunities, the council trying to charge her for Perspex screens, and the threat of a Preservation Order which might have cost her \u00a340,000 a year.\nAnd the two stories I've been following have ended up having entirely different outcomes. \nBoth artworks have been taken off the houses they were painted on \u2013 a complex, expensive operation that uses specialist equipment \u2013 so they can be sold. But while the Banksy in Margate is now on the verge of selling for well over \u00a31m, with a sizeable chunk set to go to a domestic violence charity, and with the piece remaining in the town for the foreseeable future, the Banksy up the coast in Lowestoft languishes in a climate-controlled warehouse, costing its owners \u00a33,000 per month. \nIt has cost Gert and her partner Gary around \u00a3450,000 so far to preserve the piece and although there are buyers sniffing around, nobody has bought it yet. Speaking about the situation, Gary told me: \"I'm so angry at what's going on.\"\nNot everyone approves of people trying to sell Banksy's street art. \nSteph Warren \u2013 who starred in the first series of The Banksy Story\u202fas the only person ever to work for Banksy without signing his non-disclosure agreement \u2013 suggests that worried homeowners should simply \"get busy with five litres of white emulsion and paint it out\".\nOwner of street-art gallery Stelladore in St Leonards, Warren is a purist, who feels that art made for the street should remain there, no matter its value. \"With Banksy, where he puts the art is fundamental,\" she says. \"Remove the work from the precise place on the streets that he put it, and the work instantly loses its power. Context is everything.\"\nBut Banksy has elevated graffiti into a new art form, now monetised \u2013 street art. Banksy's signed prints can sell for six-figure sums. Graffiti, or street art, has not just come of age, it is now an asset class. Given this, how can any homeowner feel okay about scrubbing away a Banksy without feeling as if they have smashed a Ming vase?\nOne thing I know for sure: if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall, you'll have to make a series of clever decisions to come out of it unscathed. As Sam says, after two years of dealing with the Banksy circus, \"going back to normal life now is going to be terribly boring\".",

Since the 1980s, he has brought history and culture to audiences in a way that textbooks simply cannot.\nBurns's body of work has earned him two Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards and 15 Emmy wins. At his home in Walpole, New Hampshire, US, the acclaimed documentary-maker tells BBC special correspondent Katty Kay that, like most creatives, he has more ideas than he knows what to do with.\n\"Your head might be filled with 40 or 50 topics, as my head is always filled up, but when one [topic] drops down to your heart, you realise it's firing on all cylinders,\" Burns tells Kay.\nThose topics have ranged from jazz to baseball, and from the granular, such as a chronicle of Leonardo da Vinci's life and work, to the expansive, like 2009's The National Parks: America's Best Idea.\n\"I don't want to tell you stories about what I know,\" he says.\u00a0\"I'd rather share with you a process of discovery. So, I dive into things that I don't know enough about.\" His next area of exploration is the 18th Century: his six-part, 12-hour series, The American Revolution, is due to air on PBS on 16 November. This month marks the 250th anniversary of the start of the American War of Independence, which began in the 13 colonies of British America in 1775, and continued for many years, culminating in the founding of a United States of America.\n\"The American Revolution is one of the most important events in human history,\" Burns told PBS ahead of special screenings for students and teachers across the US. \"We went from being subjects to inventing a new concept, citizens, and set in motion democratic revolutions around the globe.\"\nOn the subject of history, Burns says he does not subscribe to the popular view that it is always doomed to repeat itself, deferring to the opinion of the 19th-Century Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\" was Santanya's comment, in reference to the Holocaust. \"It's [a] lovely phrase you'd wish would be true,\" says Burns. He also points to the famous quote that is attributed to US author Mark Twain: \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it does often rhyme.\"\nBurns doesn't gloss over the uncomfortable parts of US history, pointing out that, for him, being patriotic doesn't mean erasing the past; for instance, the fact that Benjamin Franklin owned slaves. \"He knew it was wrong, and he kept doing it,\" Burns says.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"At the beginning, growing up, I had a kind of idealised version of my country. I love my country. I don't know anyone who loves their country more than me. I make films about the US, but I make films about us.\"\nBurns tells Kay that he believes it can take time for a story's significance to be understood. \"I've been interviewing Obama about his administration, and the longer I wait to do that film, the better it will be, because of the perspective that the passage of time will give,\" Burns says.\nWhen asked about the breadth of his work, which ranges from biographies of single individuals to global events, Burns says that he can be laser-focused on the task at hand. As Burns wraps up The American Revolution and the forthcoming Obama project, he says that he has more than enough material to last beyond \"the 2030s\" \u2013 and, in particular, he has his eyes set on a history of the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\nMore like this:\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 'I was born to be an actor': Twice-knighted Derek Jacobi on nearly 70 years on the stage and screen\n\u2022 Expect to 'age out' of your career, says Vera Wang \u2013\u00a0 she's had at least four\n\"Somebody asked of Duke Ellington, who is certainly our most prolific [composer, with] maybe 22\u2026, 2,300, 2,400 compositions, what the most important one is.

        "article_text": "Batteries for electric vehicles are notoriously difficult to recycle, but growing demand for the rare metals they contain is leading to innovative new ways of retrieving them from used power cells.\nI am standing in a lab where batteries go to be reborn. But first, they must be shredded.\nWhat arrives here is a dark powder called \"black mass\" \u2013 a substance derived from pulverising batteries almost to oblivion. Each particle is less than a millimetre across. Staff working for Altilium, a recycling firm in the south-west of England, are now tasked with extracting crucial materials from this pitch black disorder.\nThe powder contains some plastic and steel from the battery which must be separated out, but there are also sought-after materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite. These are the prized ingredients with which the lab workers here can make a new battery.\nAs the climate crisis intensifies, the world is electrifying. Countries are increasingly shifting away from fossil fuels towards renewable sources of energy including solar panels and wind turbines. Homeowners are installing heat pumps in the place of old gas or oil boilers. And drivers are increasingly buying electric vehicles (EVs) powered by batteries.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly one in five cars sold in 2023 was electric. This was a 35% year-on-year increase compared to 2022 and brought the number of EVs on the world's roads to 40 million. The problem with this is that demand for batteries, and the materials required to make them, is soaring.\n\"One of the big challenges is that the minerals are kind of concentrated in certain places,\" says Christian Marston, president and chief operating officer of Altilium. Over half of the world's nickel comes from Indonesia, while two-thirds of all cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 both of which have ongoing human rights issues associated with mining operations.\nThat's why there's now a race to find other ways of sourcing those key minerals. Recycling batteries is one option, but is also notoriously difficult. Staff at Altilium, however, say they've cracked it.\nAltilium's facility is squirreled away in the unassuming English town of Tavistock. Getting here involves driving across the windswept expanse of Dartmoor, sometimes slowing to a crawl to wait for sheep to get off the road. When I arrive, I find Altilium's building on a mundane industrial estate with a tyre shop across the road \u2013 but what they're cooking up inside is anything but mundane.\nIn the lab I find racks of glass cylinders linked together by tubes, all filled with brightly coloured liquids \u2013 mostly vivid blues and greens \u2013 running the length of the room. Nearby, a technician wearing a white lab coat and safety glasses studies the workings of these contraptions.\nThis is Altilium's solvent extraction lab, where staff retrieve sought-after battery ingredients from the black mass they process here.\nIt all began in late 2020, but got off to a slow start. \"We lost two years because of Covid,\" says Marston ruefully.\nBut in mid-2022, he and colleagues took out a lease on the Tavistock facility \u2013 at the time, an \"empty shed\", says chief technology officer Ben Wickham. The team built several laboratories, and began developing their recycling process on a small scale. Three years later, they are commissioning a larger plant just outside nearby Plymouth, which will supply recycled materials to battery manufacturers.\nThe company is one of just a handful of firms around the world that are developing methods for recycling batteries sourced from old EVs. Such firms promise to bring us one step closer to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and also closer to a circular economy, in which almost nothing is thrown away.\n\"We have to remove that myth that batteries go to landfill,\" says Marston. As EVs have become more popular, more and more of them are now reaching the end of their useful lives. That means more exhausted batteries from those aging vehicles have become available. Recycling batteries prevents expensive \u2013 and toxic \u2013 materials getting into the environment.\nSome of the other companies working on battery recycling technology are located in the US. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by President Biden's administration in 2022, which funded climate actions, has helped to motivate such efforts. Li-Cycle, a company established in 2016 which recovers critical materials from lithium-ion batteries, has plants in Canada, the US and Germany, for instance.\nHype meter\nWhile lots of companies are working on battery recycling technologies, it's worth considering how much progress each of them have actually made to date. Altilium has, to its credit, actually manufactured battery cells using recycled materials from end-of-life electric vehicle batteries.\nBut this is still far from a conveyor belt churning out finished batteries ready for consumer use. Companies currently developing environmentally-friendly forms of battery recycling must show that they can compete with more polluting but established approaches, such as pyrometallurgy. Plus, processing of the black mass from old, shredded batteries often occurs in Asia today, partly because costs are lower there.\nRedwood Materials, a US company with campuses in Northern Nevada and South Carolina, was established in 2017 by one of the founders of electric car company Tesla, and has partnerships with carmakers Toyota, VW and BMW. Some older materials companies have also started experimenting, notably the Texas-based Ecobat Solutions. And many other firms are now also investing in battery recycling tech.\nDespite the interest, however, there's much progress to be made in the area. \"The current lithium-ion battery recycling market is still in a very early industrial stage,\" says Xiaochu Wei, a battery recycling researcher at Imperial College London in the UK.\nLast year, German chemicals firm BASF \"paused\" work on a battery recycling plant in Spain, though the company says it still intends to build the facility.\nPart of the challenge in this field is how complex batteries are to begin with, which makes recycling them tricky.\nEvery battery has two main components: the cathode and the anode. When providing power to, say, a motor, the anode releases negatively-charged electrons, which flow around a circuit until they return to the battery and are absorbed by the cathode. Electrons flow in the opposite direction when the battery is charging.\nIn an electric vehicle battery, the cathode and anode are both thin sheets of material. The two are wrapped around each other in a spiral, like a Swiss roll with incredibly thin layers. In many battery designs, the anode is made of graphite, the same kind of carbon used in the cores of pencils. The cathode, meanwhile, often contains a variety of metals, including nickel, lithium and cobalt.\nAlthough recycling such structures is difficult, opportunity lies in the large number of valuable materials available, all of which can be sold lucratively if extracted and purified. Somewhat frustratingly, those materials are rather closely intermingled, and many of them are dangerous: several of the metals are toxic to people and wildlife, and they also pose fire and explosion hazards.\nAltilium's battery shredding process recovers graphite, originally from the anode, alongside other minerals. Getting graphite back out of a battery used to require a high-temperature process called pyrometallurgy, but this produces significant emissions, which is partly why Altilium has adopted a water-based system called hydrometallurgy. Staff soak the black mass in sulphuric acid, which allows them to filter out the graphite. This can be sold back to battery manufacturers, after some additional processing.\nWhat's left is an acidic liquid with a variety of metals dissolved in it. Some of them \u2013 aluminium, copper and iron \u2013 are not very valuable. By tweaking the acidity, the team can force them to precipitate out as grey powder. This, Wickham says, could be sold as filler for building materials.\nNow the team is in a position to extract the valuable nickel, cobalt and manganese. It recovers these one by one, mixing the liquid with kerosene and special chemicals that pull the metals out of solution. This is the step I saw with the glass tubes full of coloured liquids.\nWickham explains that Altilium takes this approach because manufacturers are constantly changing the chemical makeup of batteries. \"Battery chemistry is moving fast,\" he says. Wickham argues that battery companies will increasingly rely on nickel, compared to other metals, because it stores more energy for a given volume. (Some emerging battery designs, however, are moving away from nickel because of its high price tag.)\nBy separating out individual metals, Altilium aims to supply battery manufacturers with the exact mixes they want for their new cathodes. The goal is to create a \"closed-loop EV battery supply chain\" in the UK, says Marston.\nMethods that reduce old batteries to their component raw materials will be essential for sustainable economies, says Anna Hankin, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at Imperial College London in the UK, who is working on a project funded by Altilium alongside Wei. While it's possible to regenerate used batteries by replacing chemicals lost from individual components, \"at some point that process will stop working\", she says. \"There will come a point for every battery when its components need to be shredded.\"\nBesides easing the transition to net zero, Marston argues that recycling EV batteries will take us a step closer to a circular economy, where, as much as possible, raw materials would be reused and recycled endlessly. This would reduce the need for extractive industries such as mining, which often damage ecosystems and pose risks to human health.\nIn the case of EV batteries, instead of mining more lithium, nickel and other metals from the ground, we can keep reusing the supplies we already have. Researchers have estimated that, by 2040, over half the demand for lithium and nickel for these batteries could be supplied by recycling.\nIn the next five to 10 years, Wei says, recycling could provide \"a decent share\" of the raw materials needed to make EV batteries \u2013 somewhere between 10% and 40%, she estimates. It would help if battery manufacturers redesigned their batteries to make it easier for recycling facilities to separate out the key components, she adds.\nIf recycling takes off, the benefits could be significant. According to a 2024 IEA report, greater recycling of critical minerals could reduce the need for new mining by as much as 40% by mid-century. The IEA notes that many governments are creating policies to encourage recycling. For instance, in 2023 the European Union introduced a new Battery Regulation, which will introduce increasingly stringent requirements for \"recycling efficiency, material recovery and recycled content\", beginning in 2025.\nThis isn't just about being environmentally friendly: there are also geopolitical motivations. In the last 20 years, the international order of things has significantly destabilised, with shocks such as Brexit and the policies of US President Donald Trump impacting global trade and international cooperation. Countries that are overly dependent on imports of critical supplies face significant risks in this new world, says Marston.\nThe minerals used in EV batteries will be increasingly important for countries to continue functioning. \"The future economies will be the ones which control the critical minerals,\" says Marston. That means countries like the UK have a problem. \"The UK doesn't have these minerals at scale.\"\nIn Marston's view, recycling electric vehicle batteries ensures energy security. \"We see batteries which are in this country as a strategic asset in the UK,\" he says. Instead of sending them abroad to be recycled \u2013 possibly in a country with poor environmental and labour laws \u2013 he wants them to be recycled domestically. \"If you do the processing in the UK, you add the value in the UK,\" he says.\nThe challenge for all these companies is to scale up. Altilium is currently commissioning its new larger plant which should be able to operate continuously. If that proves successful, the company has plans for two progressively larger facilities.\n\"If we do battery recycling at scale, we have confidence that we can produce a material which is around 20% lower cost than commercial material,\" says Marston. \"That would look like 150,000 EV batteries per year.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Three years later, they are commissioning a larger plant just outside nearby Plymouth, which will supply recycled materials to battery manufacturers.The company is one of just a handful of firms around the world that are developing methods for recycling batteries sourced from old EVs. \"The current lithium-ion battery recycling market is still in a very early industrial stage,\" says Xiaochu Wei, a battery recycling researcher at Imperial College London in the UK.Last year, German chemicals firm BASF \"paused\" work on a battery recycling plant in Spain, though the company says it still intends to build the facility.Part of the challenge in this field is how complex batteries are to begin with, which makes recycling them tricky.Every battery has two main components: the cathode and the anode. Countries that are overly dependent on imports of critical supplies face significant risks in this new world, says Marston.AltiliumThe individual chemical components of batteries can be recovered from the black mass powder through a series of extraction steps (Credit: Altilium)The minerals used in EV batteries will be increasingly important for countries to continue functioning. The goal is to create a \"closed-loop EV battery supply chain\" in the UK, says Marston.Getty ImagesDemand for improved range and faster recharging speeds has meant that electric vehicle battery technology has developed rapidly (Credit: Getty Images)Methods that reduce old batteries to their component raw materials will be essential for sustainable economies, says Anna Hankin, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at Imperial College London in the UK, who is working on a project funded by Altilium alongside Wei.",

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

You would be thinking problem solved, the likes of Gundogan and De Bruyne can go.\n\"It's not going to be that simple, of course. City sold Rogers to Middlesbrough for about \u00a31.5m but think how much he would cost them now?\"\nGrealish scored City's first goal in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Leicester but was left out of the starting XI at Old Trafford. He replaced Ilkay Gundogan with 16 minutes to go\nIf there is an overhaul at the Etihad, then it will be with new faces, rather than tactics.\nGuardiola is never going to move away from a possession-based playing style and Given feels the old guard can no longer implement an important part of his gameplan.\n\"A lot of teams City play in the Premier League seem to have more energy, or legs, in the team,\" Given said. \"That's been an issue, because the way they press without the ball is so important to their playing style.\n\"A big part of their success down the years under Pep was when they won the ball back quickly, high up the pitch, within a few seconds of losing it.\n\"They would peg teams back and not let them out but now teams are getting through them. \n\"That needs to be rectified. It's something that will come with fresh legs from the people coming in, but that won't solve all the problems City have, because any new signings have to be the highest quality too.\n\"With De Bruyne leaving, I would love to see Guardiola build the team around Jack Grealish playing in a central role and dominating games, but it looks like the writing is on the wall for him to go as well.\n\"For whatever reason, it appears they are not getting on so it does not look good for Jack. He comes in, plays a game or two and then is back out again, no matter how well he does.\"\n\"I'm not just a fan of his, I am his ex-team-mate and friend. It's frustrating to see him being treated this way, because I know he has got so much more to offer the team. He just doesn't get the opportunities, and that is the manager's decision.\"\nStones was injured early in City's Champions League defeat by Real Madrid on 19 February and has not played since\nCity's defensive flaws have not been helped by a series of injuries to their senior centre-halves.\nRuben Dias, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake have all missed chunks of the season - Akanji and Ake are currently sidelined after surgery - while John Stones has been restricted to just six league starts.\nKhusanov and Reis, who have only recently turned 21 and 19 respectively, arrived as defensive reinforcements in January but Given would be wary of making sweeping  changes at the back.\n\"None of the four established centre-halves are near their mid-30s yet,\" Given said. \"Stones is the oldest, and he turns 31 in May, so I still feel they have all got plenty to offer. I'd be reluctant to let any of them go. With Stones, for example, they just have to get him fit.\n\"If the club considers them all to be injury prone, then that is a problem. But equally you can't just get rid of all that experience, because you need it in that position. A situation next season where Khusanov and Reis are at centre-half would be a bit worrying.\"\nThere is further uncertainty over the futures of Kyle Walker, on loan at AC Milan, and goalkeeper Ederson, who considered a move to Saudi Arabia last year before committing to another campaign at the Etihad.\n\"The club could get big money for Ederson to fund signings, but then they would have to replace him too,\" Given added.\n\"There are definitely other positions they should be looking at. Ederson is a brilliant goalkeeper, who is so vital to the way they play out from the back. I don't think there is another keeper in the world who is better with the ball at his feet.\n\"He is only 31, so he has plenty of years left at the very top level - I was 33 when I joined City, so I would certainly not be rushing him out of the door - they should try to keep hold of him if they can.\"\nEderson joined City from Benfica for \u00a335m in 2017. He won the Premier League Golden Glove award for most clean sheets in a season for three years running between 2020 and 2022\nWhatever City's next step is, they will have a new voice shaping their transfer strategy. Txiki Begiristain is leaving in the summer with Hugo Viana replacing him as director of football.\n\"I played with Hugo at Newcastle and I am looking forward to meeting him again,\" Given said. \"I am excited to see how he gets on at City but Txiki has left big boots to fill. For a long time City's transfers were brilliant, they hardly put a foot wrong.\n\"Fixing the squad is part of Hugo's job now but there is a lot of transition going on at the club and there is no guarantee any of it will be smooth.\n\"We are about to find out what Pep's masterplan is too and it will be fascinating to see how he does next season - he has only known amazing success with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City and this is the first time in his managerial career that things have not gone his way.\n\"Can he rebuild City, and come back and win the Premier League again? That is the big question right now, isn't it?\"",

        "article_text": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Wardrobe Ministry)\nBangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui. \u00a0\nHome to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\u00a0\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night \u2013 daytime, office hours \u2013 we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nTip:\nIf you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes\u00a0Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui \u2013 and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns \u2013 you name it \u2013 Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.\nTip:\nNightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach \u2013 that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui \u2013 eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds \u2013 the parties attract thousands of attendants \u2013 Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,\u00a0 Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\u00a0\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\u00a0\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach \u2013 Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional \u2013 truly local \u2013 food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\u00a0\nAs a sports enthusiast \u2013 he practices Muay Thai \u2013 Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand \u2013 \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says \u2013 the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring \u2013 the only one of its kind in the world.\u00a0\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite: \nhttps://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram: \n@rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\u00a0\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\n*This article, originally published on 26 February 2025, provides a companion to fans tuning into the Season 3 finale on 6 April.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From Drop to A Minecraft Movie, these are the films to stream at home and watch at the cinema this month.\nDavid Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-tinged drama stars Vincent Cassel as Karsh, an inventor who looks a lot like Cronenberg himself. Grief-stricken by the death of his wife (Diane Kruger), Karsh develops camera systems that can be buried with corpses, so that their relatives can watch them on monitors as they decompose. The invention catches on, but one night some graves containing these high-tech \"shrouds\" are desecrated, so Karsh and his brother-in-law (Guy Pearce) have to work out who was responsible. This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a \"restrained, even elegant\" film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement, says Steve Pond at The Wrap. \"It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief\u2026 Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore.\"\nReleased on 18 April in the US\nThree of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Muriel, the fianc\u00e9e of an upstanding Korean War veteran, Lee (Will Poulter). He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races. Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the film a \"quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast\", adding: \"On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting.\" On the other hand, the BBC's Caryn James considers it \"a disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film\".\nReleased on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France\nOn a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family \u2013 a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. \"The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,\" says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, \"complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work.\"\nReleased on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland\nRyan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music \"can pierce the veil between life and death\". The town is soon infested with vampires \u2013 but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. \"The film is very genre-fluid,\" Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family.\"\nReleased internationally on 18 April\nFirst dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. \"[Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,\" says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. \"Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.\"\nReleased internationally on 11 April\nWhen Alex Garland was making his last film, Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the \"war is hell\" concept \"to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion\", says Kevin Maher in The Times. \"This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK\nIf you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles \u2013 but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. \"Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,\" says David Hughes in Time Out, \"Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland\nWhat if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. \"It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,\" Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21.\nReleased on 10 April on Prime\nA Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. \"By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things \u2013 a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions \u2013 is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,\" says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. \"There's an 'anything goes' attitude here\u2026 [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore.\"\nReleased internationally on 4 April\nWith a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends \u2013 one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing \u2013 embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine. David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angarano \"graduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director\" with Sacramento. \"Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US\nAng Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. \"An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,\" says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, \"but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves\".\nReleased on 18 April in the US and Canada\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Once home to a thriving Jewish majority, Thessaloniki holds fragments of a lost world. One traveller's journey to find them leads to something even more powerful: living memory.\nAs my family admired the gleaming remodel of Thessaloniki's century-old Modiano Market, local culinary guide Smaragda Marki admitted to me that among the trendy cafes and German delicatessen, she wished it were just a little more Greek. \"I wish it were a little more Jewish,\" I responded, staring up at the colourful Easter decorations.\nThe newly reopened market had topped my list of places to go in Greece's second-largest city, bringing together my two favourite things to look for while travelling: good food and tidbits of Jewish history. However, Modiano left me dissatisfied on both counts. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.\nThessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Known as Salonika at the time, it was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. The Ottoman Empire allowed Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th Century to settle there for hundreds of years. But with Ottoman power beginning to wane in the early 20th Century, Greece took over the city in 1912. Five years later, the Great Fire of 1917 devastated huge swaths of the city and left 70,000 people homeless, including much of the Jewish population. The Talmud Torah Synagogue (and 31 others) were destroyed. The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.\nEighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. It wasn't surprising; Thessaloniki's Jewish community now numbers less than 1,000 people, a small population sample within which to find a niche professional tour guide. Plenty of companies offered tours of Jewish Thessaloniki, most touting bonafides by proximity to, rather than being a part of the small congregation.\nEventually, I booked through a company based in Athens because it was run by a Greek Jew. I still didn't know if my actual guides would be Jewish, though at least I could be sure they were trusted by the community.\nWhen Elia Matalon greeted us the next morning, I let out a sigh of relief. In the lobby of our hotel, he explained that he and his wife Hella Kounio-Matalon run their tours together and they both come from families that go back many generations in Thessaloniki's Jewish community. Later in the eight-hour tour he would tell us about how his mother survived the war by hiding in homes across the border in Albania while Kounio-Matalon spoke of her father surviving Auschwitz. We began walking toward a Holocaust memorial sculpture, through a narrow alleyway where he pointed to a restaurant owned by a gentile chef who became fascinated by the city's Jewish history and now serves traditional Sephardic Jewish foods like nogada (meatballs in walnut sauce).\nMuch of the city's history is Jewish history. In the Ano Ladadika neighbourhood, we stared up at the city's famous broken clock, stopped by an earthquake in 1978. The building originally belonged to a bank started by the Italian Jewish Allatini brothers, 19th-Century entrepreneurs whose flour company grew to be the largest in the Balkans before World War Two.\nWe walked down adjacent Siggrou Street and paused in front of a 1926 mansion. Today, it houses a hookah bar, which meant we could wander into the lovely plant-filled atrium and up the grand staircase. Outside, Matalon pointed out the holes in the doorpost where a mezuzah once hung. A visible symbol of Jewish identity, the traditional decorative case holds a prayer, fulfilling the commandment to \"write them on the doorposts of your house\".\nSo much of visiting Jewish history around the world is like this: evidence of where we once were. Visiting the former site of the Jewish cemetery. Peering at painted-over holes and fading stars of David. Jews left their mark on Thessaloniki, but hardly in a fashion that hints to the glorious centre of Jewish life it once was. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.\nAcross the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Because Thessaloniki's laws granted properties owned by Jews before WW2 without surviving family members to the Jewish community, the congregation owns the building, which mostly houses offices, and the synagogue on the ground floor. Marble tablets on the wall list the more than 70 synagogues that served the city's once much-larger Jewish population. The money the rent brings in allows the synagogue to pay retirees to show up to complete their minyan (the minimum number of people needed for a prayer service), a win-win situation.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Mediterranean's ancient gay-friendly civilisation\n\u2022 The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\n\u2022 The tiny, idyllic island where Greeks escape the heat\nOutside the building, I learned how a bench signals that a piece of Thessaloniki's Jewish culture still lives within. The decorative wooden top looks the same as any other bench, a comforting and welcoming place to sit on busy Vasileos Irakleiou, between a synagogue and Modiano Market. Below, a sturdy cement bollard telegraphs its true purpose: these surround all the remaining Jewish sites in the city, protecting them from potential violence by vehicle.\nWe see them again outside the only remaining pre-WW2 synagogue, the community's other house of prayer. The Monastir Synagogue escaped destruction by invading Axis forces because the Red Cross used it during the war, a story that would be slightly more heartwarming if they hadn't nearly destroyed it themselves by using it as a storehouse and stable. It has since been returned to its stained-glass and marble-walled glory.\nA large tour group from a cruise, wearing headsets to hear their guide, filed in, and I browsed the tiny museum in the foyer until they left, just a few minutes later. Then Matalon and Kounio-Matalon announced that they had a surprise for us. Together, they offered to sing a song in Ladino, the ancient version of Judeo-Spanish spoken by the region's Jews: Adio Kerido (Goodbye, Beloved), a love song repurposed as a farewell to Holocaust deportees.\nBy the time they stepped onto the bimah, the raised platform at the front of the sanctuary, I had already seen the history for which I came: the train car parked permanently at the station in memory of the city's Jews, who were deported in similar ones; the mansions built by the thriving majority population of the 19th Century; and the lovely, solemn Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki. But as their voices joined, reverberating in the incredible acoustics of the large room, singing \"Adio, adio, kerido\", I realised I'd found something even better: a unique Jewish culture still alive.\n\"No kero la vida,\" they sang hauntingly, beautifully, mournfully, \"I don't want to live.\" The song offered such sorrow for the departing love, but it brought me such happiness to hear, to see this moment, the kind of moment for which people travel. A moment that could never be predicted, that could never be expected, and, more than anything, that could never happen anywhere else in the world except precisely here.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.\nSo it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.\nNelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.\nInconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.\nIt's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date. \n\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.\n\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\" \nHe believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".\n\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.\n\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"\nThe rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.\nAnd he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.\nHe says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".\nGraham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.\nThis City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.\nThe Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".\nIn a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".\nThe Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"\nBut the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".\nThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".\n\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.\nAnother reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"\n\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.\nFormer engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.\nBeautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).\n\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.\n\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"\nHe says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.\nAs for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.\n\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.\n\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.\nBoth underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.\n\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.\nHe recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".\nThe reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.\n\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"\nHis celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".\nTony Soprano could not have put it better himself.\nThis City Is Ours airs on BBC One on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

        "article_text": "Liverpool's loss at Fulham was their first away league defeat under Arne Slot\nLiverpool's unbeaten run has come to an end but - barring a remarkable collapse - they will end the season as Premier League champions.\nDefeat at Fulham was the Reds' first in 26 league games and just their second of the campaign.\nBut with seven games remaining, Arne Slot's side require a maximum of 11 points more to secure the title.\n\"If you look at the goals we conceded, I think all three, we could have prevented them,\" Slot told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"That is not what we usually see and that is probably why we are where we are, because if you make these mistakes more often in this league, you would not have the amount of points we have.\n\"The second half is much more like the team we are. Conceding three goals in the manner we did is not of the standards of Liverpool. That's clear.\"\nDespite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?\nThey could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.\nThe Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.\nSlot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.\n\"We played a good game on Wednesday [against Everton] and we will show up against West Ham [on Sunday] as well,\" he told Sky Sports.\nLiverpool's 26-match unbeaten run ended by Fulham\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nThis video can not be played\n'Mo will show up' - Slot not worried by Salah's form\nWe've all heard the accusations and whispers this season from rival fans, haven't we?\n'This Liverpool team isn't actually that great.' 'The Premier League is a poor league this season.' 'Liverpool's class of 2024-25 wouldn't have won the title in another season.'\nSunday's loss will only add to those shouts.

And Slot's men have certainly done that.Even if Arsenal were on the 71 points they had reached at this stage last season, when they were top of the table, Liverpool would still be two points ahead of them. \"Despite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?They could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.The Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.Slot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.",

Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added.\nSome of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.\nAnd the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face.\n\"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said.\nThe BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications.\nPeople have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons.\nKirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve.\nShe said her \"breasts were basically down to my bellybutton\" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said.\n\"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now,\" she said. \n\"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy.\"\nMen underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset.\nNose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023.\nFace and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated.\nBeauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol. \nThe pandemic also caused a shift, when the move towards video calls \"heightened our awareness of our appearance\" because people saw their own faces on their computer screens.\nDr Daniels said that society places value on youthful looks, which could push some women to get cosmetic procedures.\n\"As women age, they're often discounted in a number of ways\" and are \"made to feel invisible in society\", she said.\nBAAPS vice president Anthony Macquillan suggested the overall increase in facelifts could be linked to societal changes, such as the rising pension age.\nHe said: \"For many, this type of surgery is not just aesthetic but also functional, helping to maintain confidence, secure employment, and reduce anxiety associated with age-related bias.\"\nThe BAAPS data is based on statistics from 233 of its members. Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox.\nThe data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits. \nCosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\". \nIt advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure.\n\"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.",

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away.

If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.Bradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.Just seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side.

He is looking for a third victory in four years, while McIlroy is seeking to win the title for the first time.\nScheffler had a standout year in 2024, winning nine events including the Masters, and while he has not enjoyed the same stellar start to 2025, he is yet to finish outside the top 20 in five previous appearances in the first men's major of the year.\nMcIlroy, ranked second, needs this title to become just the sixth player to win the career Grand Slam of all four majors. It will be his 11th attempt to join a pantheon of greats including Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen and Gary Player.\nFor the first time, the Northern Irishman has won twice on the PGA Tour before arriving at Augusta, including last month's prestigious Players Championship, which has only intensified the hype.\nBut there are potential winners everywhere in the 96-man field.\nSwedish sensation Ludvig Aberg finished runner-up to Scheffler last year in a debut major to remember. Could he go on to emulate Jordan Spieth, who finished second in his debut year, before winning the title 12 months later in 2015?\nEngland's Tommy Fleetwood will be encouraged by his joint third last year, while his compatriot Matt Fitzpatrick is a proven major winner and Wolverhampton's Aaron Rai is making his Masters debut after rising through the rankings.\nScotland's Bob MacIntyre is making his first start in three years but made the cut in his first two attempts, with a best finish of joint 12th. He arrives in Augusta with five top-15 returns in 2025.\nXander Schauffele has had four top-10 finishes in his previous six Masters and is coming off the back of a breakthrough 2024 in the majors where he won his first and second titles.\nCollin Morikawa, ranked one place below Schauffele at fourth in the world, also enjoys Augusta and has had three top-10s in his past three starts, finishing joint third in 2024.\nUS Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is enjoying something of a renaissance in his career and is 14th in the world rankings.\nThe 38-year-old has never finished inside the top 20 at Augusta but won his seventh PGA Tour title at last year's BMW Championship and has had two top-10s this season, making the cut in all seven events he has played.\nLIV Golf is well represented, with a dozen players from the Saudi-backed circuit heading to Georgia.\nJon Rahm won this title in 2023 and perhaps has a better chance of adding to his tally than Dustin Johnson (2020), Patrick Reed (2018) and Sergio Garcia (2017) who are all recent champions.\nChile's Joaquin Niemann has won twice on the LIV circuit this year and is once again being touted as a potential winner, while Bryson DeChambeau showed playing the 54-hole LIV tournaments had not harmed his major aspirations as he won his second US Open title last year\nAnd finally... although he is not a favourite to win, many eyes will be on Germany's Bernhard Langer this week as the 67-year-old makes his 41st and final start on the 40th anniversary of the first of his two wins.\nFive-time Masters champion Tiger Woods will not be playing at Augusta National this year because he is still recovering after rupturing an Achilles tendon in March.\nOn 1 April the 15-time major champion wrote on X: \"I can't believe I am saying this, but a few weeks after rupturing my left Achilles, the sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber plus the explosive lifts, my doctors and trainers have me ready to play the Masters next week! Can't wait! See y'all on the course.\"\nHowever, minutes later, he added the message: \"P.S. April Fools my Achilles is still a mess :)\"\nWoods had surgery on the injury, which also kept him out of the PGA Tour's flagship Players Championship, on 11 March.\nHe had been hoping to make his comeback at Augusta, having not competed in a PGA Tour event since last July's Open at Royal Troon.\nThe 49-year-old then had his sixth back procedure in 10 years in September 2024.\nWoods planned to return at the Genesis Invitational in February but withdrew following the death of his mother, Kultida.\n\nThe BBC weather forecast for Augusta, Georgia is predicting drizzle and light rain on the Monday and Wednesday practice days of Masters week, with a sunnier day on Tuesday and maximum temperatures of 15C.\nThere is little to no rain and light winds forecast for the Championship days. The temperature is set to warm up throughout the week with a maximum of 18C for the final round on Sunday.\nMasters tradition dictates that the new champion is helped into his Green Jacket by the previous year's winner\nIt is arguably the most sought-after jacket in sport.\nThe great Bobby Jones, founder of the Augusta National Golf Club in 1933 and co-founder of the Masters which began in 1934, came up with the idea of a members' jacket.\nThe American amateur, who won seven majors, took his lead from Royal Liverpool, after winning The Open in 1927. He liked the red hunting jacket worn by the club's former captains.\nRed, yellow and 'Georgia peach' colours were all floated between Jones and his business partner Clifford Roberts before the latter, inspired by the colour of the leaves on the azalea bushes that dominate Augusta National, suggested green.\nThe idea was that members wore the jacket and were therefore easily recognisable by spectators visiting the course.\nSam Snead was the first Masters winner to be awarded a Green Jacket, in 1949.\nIt is made of an inexpensive wool-polyester mix and costs about \u00a3195 to make each one. The colour is known as 'Pantone 342'.\nEach jacket is kept permanently in the Champions Locker Room and only worn during Masters Week, strictly within the confines of Augusta National's clubhouse.\nInitially, only first-time winners were allowed to remove the jacket from the property and then just for the first 12 months. Recently, winners have been given a replica jacket they can take away.\nThe Par 3 Contest is a relaxing Wednesday-afternoon event with families and friends heavily involved\nFirst played in 1960, the Par 3 Contest has become the traditional fun curtain-raiser to the Masters.\nIt will start around 17:00 BST on Wednesday, 10 April.

The pressure remains to urgently find a viable long-term solution for the canal. \n\"We will continue to call on the Welsh government to help secure a more sustainable future for this beautiful canal that brings so much to the area.\"\nThe Welsh government previously said \"protecting and enhancing our environment and natural resources is key to addressing the climate and nature emergencies\".\nIt added any arrangement between the canal and Welsh Water would be a commercial contractual decision in which it should not be involved.\nWelsh Water said it was \"pleased to have come to an agreement to support the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal that covers the cost of providing the water and doesn't incur additional costs for our customers or put at risk the supply of drinking water over the summer\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the Canal and Rivers Trust, Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Government on a longer-term solution that can support the canal beyond the coming year,\" it added.",

        "article_text": "On a quick drive around the small Ohio town of Delta, you can spot nearly as many Trump flags as American stars-and-stripes banners.\nAnd at the petrol station near the Ohio Turnpike, the pumps bear relics of the last administration, with slogans slamming Trump's predecessor: \"Whoever voted for Biden owes me gas money!\"\nThis is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.\nThose plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.\nFor some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.\n\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"\nMiller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.\nAs she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectionaries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.\nMiller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.\n\"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said.\n\"If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.\"\nThese sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks. \nThe automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.\nBut on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.\nOne of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nAt the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.\nNorth Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.\nThe workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.\nIt was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.\nOutside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.\n\"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.\nAlthough he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement.\n\"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said.\nA couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president.\nBut Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\"\n\"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party.\nThe Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie.\nAnd as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks.\n\"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled.

        "article_text": "Rural North Yorkshire is having its Hollywood moment. \nThe latest production to be filmed in the region is a new adaptation of the classic novel Wuthering Heights, which has just finished shooting in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\nIt stars Australian actress Margot Robbie, who recently took the lead role in Barbie, and will play Cathy alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff.\nEmily Bronte's novel was written in 1847 and set in the rugged Yorkshire moors.\nThe locations chosen for the new film included Arkengarthdale, Swaledale and the village of Low Row. Robbie, 35, stayed at the hotel Simonstone Hall, near Hawes, with other cast members.\nShe was also photographed in a white wedding gown surrounded by film crew for a scene believed to be her marriage to Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton.\nFashion bible Vogue has criticised her dress as being historically inaccurate, as the style was only popularised by Queen Victoria 40 years after the story is set.\nThe hotel is a \"historic country lodge\" where presenter Jeremy Clarkson famously got into a fight with a Top Gear producer in 2015. \nA staff member said Robbie was \"very lovely\" and even enjoyed a Sunday roast and afternoon tea there with her husband and new baby. \nThe employee told the BBC: \"It was a very positive stay for over a week and they enjoying the restaurant and and eating in the bar with her co-stars and production crew too.\n\"The weekend was great fun, where she met lots of other guests and visitors and she introduced her baby to the resident pigs and peacocks here.\" \nThe film crew's base camp was near Holiday Home Yorkshire in Reeth, whose owner said it was \"very exciting\" seeing the trailers in the tiny village. \nOne local holiday let owner said he saw Robbie driving a tractor with her co-star - although the agricultural vehicles were not invented until the late 19th Century.\nHe said: \"There were four tractors, old-fashioned open-to-the-elements style and they were being escorted by two Range Rovers.\"\nAnother Dales resident said he had seen filming at Surrender Bridge, which is close to an old lead smelting mill. The landmark also featured in the opening scene of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small in the 1980s and is on the Coast to Coast path route.\nCrew members also stayed at the Charles Bathurst Inn, in Arkengarthdale, and were described as \"very friendly\". \nThe film, directed by Emerald Fennell, is due for release in February 2026. \nThere are hopes that it will lead to an upsurge in interest in the Bronte sisters and their work.\nThe director of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, a literary museum located at the former Bronte family home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, said: \"Every screen or theatre adaptation brings something fresh for contemporary audiences to think about. \n\"It is a testimony of Emily's legacy that her writing continues to inspire creatives today and we look forward to seeing what Emerald Fennell's adaptation adds to the mix.\" \nHaworth Parsonage is where Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights and lived with her sisters Charlotte and Anne, and it was gifted to the Bronte Society in 1928. \nIt has the largest collection of Bront\u00eb items in the world. \nDirector Rebecca Yorke added: \"We're also delighted that some filming has taken place at nearby locations and hope that this will attract new visitors to the area and to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum.\" \nThere have been at least 10 film and television adaptations of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel. \nOne of the most well-known was the 1939 version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nOther high-profile actors who have played Heathcliff over the years include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Richard Burton. \nMeanwhile, North Yorkshire was also the filming location for a Christmas film starring Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland. \nTinsel Town will be released in December 2025 and was shot in Knaresborough.\nWilson, 45, said at the time she \"loved\" the area and had been practising her Yorkshire accent. \nIn 2021, Tom Cruise surprised locals of Pickering when he touched down in a helicopter to shoot scenes for Mission: Impossible at a heritage railway. \nThe owner of a local B&B said in a Facebook post they had been walking the dog when they \"bumped into\" the Hollywood megastar.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

        "article_text": "Rory McIlroy's Augusta troubles started on the 10th hole of the final round in 2011 with a wayward drive into the trees down the left\nIt is often referred to as the most important distance in golf; the five inches between the ears.\nThe game is as much a test of temperament as technique and champions at the very highest level have to conquer both elements to land the biggest titles.\nIn their pomp the likes of Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood had the physical attributes to win any tournament they played. But something would always get in the way when it came to the majors; the big four tournaments that define careers.\nThere was always a stumbling block at the Masters, The Open, the US Open or US PGA Championship. It prevented them, and many others, from producing their best shots when they most needed them.\nIt is not a slight to say this. It's golf. The mental challenge of pulling off key shots when the only inhibiter is the pressure of the moment encapsulates the magic of the game.\nIt will be evident in abundance again this week as Rory McIlroy embarks on his latest attempt to complete the career Grand Slam. He is among the world's best who are all gathering together for the first time in eight months for the Masters at Augusta National.\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\nMcIlroy can cope with Masters pressure - Mickelson\nMcIlroy dealing with elbow issue before Masters\nThese major weeks are the ultimate individual examination and for all his prolific form at tour level, McIlroy has failed to add to his tally of four major wins since 2014.\nWe wonder why Westwood and Monty never won a major, why it took Phil Mickelson until his 13th year on tour to land his first win on this elevated stage but the most burning current question surrounds McIlroy's frustrations - the majors and most pertinently the Masters.\nSo precocious was the Northern Irishman's talent when he first competed as a teenager in 2009 he was asked about completing the Grand Slam by the age of 22.\nTwo years on at Augusta he led by four shots going into the final round, only to shoot 80 in a scarring denouement. Despite four subsequent top-five finishes, he has never since embarked on the final day back nine with a real chance of glory.\n\"The biggest challenge for Rory is the mental one,\" said Paul McGinley. The former Ryder Cup captain's Golf Channel colleague, Brandel Chamblee, added of the Masters. \"It is literally his nemesis, It brings out the worst golf in Rory annually.\"\nMcIlroy dropped six shots in three holes in the final round as his hopes of winning the 2011 Masters evaporated\nThe popular view is that McIlroy suffers from a build up of mental scar tissue, first triggered by that Augusta capitulation in 2011.\nAlthough he quickly started collecting his quartet of majors, post 2014 there have been many instances where further setbacks have added to the malaise. Most recent was last year's US Open where he was beaten by to the title by Bryson DeChambeau despite leading by two with five holes to play.\n\"It is possible for people to build something up in their heads and say this is the one that I struggle with because previously something bad happened,\" chartered psychologist Stephen Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"That memory hasn't been processed properly out of what we call the short term executive memory into your long term memory. \n\"And it's literally interfering with the performance message from the higher order brain. \n\"It's almost like a mini form of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).\"\nSmith has worked with athletes across a wide range of sports and says bad memories can influence physical performance.\n\"The wire that carries the performance movement message from your brain to your body gets that wonderful swing going in a connected way,\" he said.\n\"And that's why you make more mistakes on that hole or on that course or in that tournament, because you're just literally not able to send the signal to the muscles. It's getting interfered with by what you would call scar tissue.\"\nNot since that ill-fated tilt in 2011, when he began with a 65, has McIlroy made a dominant start to the Masters. He has only broken 70 on one occasion - a 69 in 2018 when he finished tied fifth behind Patrick Reed after a final round 74.\nIn this period he has won at every level, including the prestigious Players Championship twice. The second of those Sawgrass wins occurred only last month and that combined with a fine win at Pebble Beach in February is fuelling optimism for this week.\nThe now 35-year-old is second favourite behind defending champion Scottie Scheffler, who has yet to win this year. Indeed, of all the biggest names, McIlroy has had the most successful start to the year.\nStars are aligning for him to win the one major to elude him.\nVictory this week would put him alongside the all time greats; Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods - the only golfers to have won all four majors and completed the Grand Slam collection.\nMcIlroy is desperate to wear the famous Green Jacket, but can you want it too much?  \n\"That's a very good point,\" said Smith.\n\"All of this is said without me ever having spoken to Rory, I couldn't comment as to how accurate my views on the situation are.\n\"But looking at it from outside the goldfish bowl that is tournament golf, you look at it and say, OK, right, maybe that's it, it could be that he actually wants it too much.\"\nMcIlroy has been working with sports psychologist Bob Rotella in the build up to his 17th attempt at winning the Masters. \"I think he'll have him very well prepared now,\" McGinley said.\n\"They've had two or three runs at this now, and I think they will be coming up with a plan in terms of taking that pressure and decimating it and putting it aside.\"\nSmith believes the answer lies in reaffirming good memories, such as McIlroy's imperious opening drive in his three-hole play-off win over JJ Spaun at the Players three weeks ago. The champion admitted to being very nervous before that tee shot.\nNicklaus, winner of a record 18 majors, used to insist he never missed a short putt in the sport's biggest championships, which was not true but a valuable technique to reaffirm confidence. Woods would celebrate fine shots with a trademark move with his club.\n\"Tiger with his club twirl,\" said Smith, who is an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society. \"It's a hard copy down of the good stuff into the long-term memory so he can draw on it.\n\"I know that I can do it. I know that I've won.\"\nAnd while the notion of accumulated mental scar tissue is potentially ruinous, Smith believes that McIIroy is at a prime age to deal with any such issue.\n\"His emotional intelligence is growing, immensely,\" he said. \"He is not the man he was was when he was 29 or 30.\"\nAnd in 2025, McIlroy - without yet playing at his very best - looks assured. Using a different ball this year his technique, especially in his approach play, looks better nuanced and more effective.\nSo this might just be the year for the man with 28 PGA Tour wins, but no major victories in his past 38 attempts. He is playing the best golf of any of the leading contenders, but this week carries a mental burden far greater than any of his rivals.\nIt is the bit between the ears.\n\"You've got to own it because if you don't it'll just niggle away at you,\" Smith said. \"So you've got to almost burst that cyst, excise it, clean it out,  deal with it.\"",

        "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed accusations that Washington was left unable to help in the Myanmar earthquake due to the Donald Trump administration's shuttering of its humanitarian aid agency.\nAsked by the BBC why the US had not meaningfully responded, as it routinely has to past such disasters, Rubio said \"we are not the government of the world\".\nEarlier this week, former officials at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) said the US was left unable to send rescuers and dogs due to the agency's dismantling. \nRubio said the US had to balance global humanitarian rescue work with \"other needs\" and \"other priorities\" that were in the US national interests.\n\"There's a lot of other rich countries in the world, they should all be pitching in.\n\"We're going to do our part. We already have people there. We'll have more people there. We'll help as much as we can [but] it's not the easiest place to work\u2026 they have a military junta that doesn't like us,\" Rubio said.\nOn Tuesday, a former USAID official told the BBC the shuttering of the agency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, meant the White House could not send teams from the US to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the 28 March magnitude 7.7 earthquake. \nThe confirmed death toll rose to 3,354 on 4 April, Myanmar's ruling military said. The number of injured stood at 4,508, while 220 were still missing.\nRoutinely in such earthquakes, the US can deploy up to 200 rescue workers and sniffer dogs along with specialist equipment, and is often the biggest and best equipment foreign response team on the ground. \nLast week, the state department said a US team of three advisers based in the region was being sent to disaster zone.\nSpeaking to reporters at a Nato meeting in Brussels,  Rubio blamed the military regime in Myanmar for the lack of access, even though the state department said earlier this week the country had made a formal request for assistance. \nFormer USAID officials say their work is seen as non-political, and they have previously accessed countries regarded as politically hostile.\n\"That would have impeded our response, no matter what,\" said Rubio.\n\"That said, we are willing to continue to help in the humanitarian crisis. Other countries need to do so as well. China is a very rich country. India is a rich country. There are a lot of other countries in the world, and everyone should pitch in.\"\nChina and India were among the first to have teams on the ground in Myanmar, according to former American humanitarian officials.\nRubio dismissed the accounts of humanitarian aid experts who said the inability to deploy a large US rescue team was due to the USAID cuts.\n\"These are people that make millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in these NGOs [non-governmental organisations] all over the world that stand up and they get flooded with the US taxpayer money, and then we have to spend 10 [or] 100 million dollars to get 10 million to people. We're not doing that anymore. Okay? We have stopped. We are no longer going to spend 10 million, 100 million dollars to get 10 million to recipients.\n\"We're not going to fund these global NGOs all over the world that are living off of this. We're not doing it.\n\"We are prepared to help and work with governments and appropriate NGOs on the ground that are delivering assistance. We will be there, and we will be helpful [but] there are a lot of other rich countries, they should also pitch in and help\u2026 we are going to do our part,\" Rubio added.\nAs news of the Myanmar earthquake emerged, the White House had reportedly tried to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) from the US - but could not do so because the Trump administration's cuts had cancelled logistics contracts and fired officials who oversaw such deployments, according to the former officials. \nThe cuts to USAID had been led by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after President Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".",

        "article_text": "Ahead of his upcoming PBS documentary, The American Revolution, acclaimed film-maker Ken Burns tells BBC special correspondent Katty Kay about his unique approach to chronicling US history, from war and conflict to baseball and jazz.\nTitles like Brooklyn Bridge, Prohibition and The Dust Bowl may conjure visions of classroom lessons and by-the-book recitations of facts, but portraying historical events in an approachable \u2013 and enthralling \u2013 way has become US documentarian Ken Burns's trademark. Since the 1980s, he has brought history and culture to audiences in a way that textbooks simply cannot.\nBurns's body of work has earned him two Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards and 15 Emmy wins. At his home in Walpole, New Hampshire, US, the acclaimed documentary-maker tells BBC special correspondent Katty Kay that, like most creatives, he has more ideas than he knows what to do with.\n\"Your head might be filled with 40 or 50 topics, as my head is always filled up, but when one [topic] drops down to your heart, you realise it's firing on all cylinders,\" Burns tells Kay.\nThose topics have ranged from jazz to baseball, and from the granular, such as a chronicle of Leonardo da Vinci's life and work, to the expansive, like 2009's The National Parks: America's Best Idea.\n\"I don't want to tell you stories about what I know,\" he says.\u00a0\"I'd rather share with you a process of discovery. So, I dive into things that I don't know enough about.\" His next area of exploration is the 18th Century: his six-part, 12-hour series, The American Revolution, is due to air on PBS on 16 November. This month marks the 250th anniversary of the start of the American War of Independence, which began in the 13 colonies of British America in 1775, and continued for many years, culminating in the founding of a United States of America.\n\"The American Revolution is one of the most important events in human history,\" Burns told PBS ahead of special screenings for students and teachers across the US. \"We went from being subjects to inventing a new concept, citizens, and set in motion democratic revolutions around the globe.\"\nOn the subject of history, Burns says he does not subscribe to the popular view that it is always doomed to repeat itself, deferring to the opinion of the 19th-Century Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\" was Santanya's comment, in reference to the Holocaust. \"It's [a] lovely phrase you'd wish would be true,\" says Burns. He also points to the famous quote that is attributed to US author Mark Twain: \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it does often rhyme.\"\nBurns doesn't gloss over the uncomfortable parts of US history, pointing out that, for him, being patriotic doesn't mean erasing the past; for instance, the fact that Benjamin Franklin owned slaves. \"He knew it was wrong, and he kept doing it,\" Burns says.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"At the beginning, growing up, I had a kind of idealised version of my country.

I make films about the US, but I make films about us.\"\nBurns tells Kay that he believes it can take time for a story's significance to be understood. \"I've been interviewing Obama about his administration, and the longer I wait to do that film, the better it will be, because of the perspective that the passage of time will give,\" Burns says.\nWhen asked about the breadth of his work, which ranges from biographies of single individuals to global events, Burns says that he can be laser-focused on the task at hand. As Burns wraps up The American Revolution and the forthcoming Obama project, he says that he has more than enough material to last beyond \"the 2030s\" \u2013 and, in particular, he has his eyes set on a history of the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\nMore like this:\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 'I was born to be an actor': Twice-knighted Derek Jacobi on nearly 70 years on the stage and screen\n\u2022 Expect to 'age out' of your career, says Vera Wang \u2013\u00a0 she's had at least four\n\"Somebody asked of Duke Ellington, who is certainly our most prolific [composer, with] maybe 22\u2026, 2,300, 2,400 compositions, what the most important one is.

This month marks the 250th anniversary of the start of the American War of Independence, which began in the 13 colonies of British America in 1775, and continued for many years, culminating in the founding of a United States of America.I make films about the US, but I make films about us \u2013 Ken Burns\"The American Revolution is one of the most important events in human history,\" Burns told PBS ahead of special screenings for students and teachers across the US. \"Films about the US are films about us, says Ken BurnsOn the subject of history, Burns says he does not subscribe to the popular view that it is always doomed to repeat itself, deferring to the opinion of the 19th-Century Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana. At his home in Walpole, New Hampshire, US, the acclaimed documentary-maker tells BBC special correspondent Katty Kay that, like most creatives, he has more ideas than he knows what to do with.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or import taxes - for nearly every country in the world could push prices up on almost all the staples Americans routinely buy, from clothes to coffee.\nAfter declaring a national economic emergency on Wednesday, the US president announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of goods of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. They start taking effect on 5 April.\nEconomists have warned the new levies - and those that other countries impose in retaliation - could push prices up for Americans across the board, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that they will increase inflation.\nThat's because the companies importing the goods may pass the costs of the tariffs on to customers or simply bring fewer products into the country, creating a limited supply.\nHere are six everyday items that could become more expensive for American consumers.\nThe \"worst offenders\" about to be hit with the highest tariffs include the clothing manufacturing hubs of Vietnam, China and Bangladesh. The three - among the top five largest apparel importers to the US - could soon see levies ranging from 34% to 46% charged on their products.\nThat means major US department stores like Target and Walmart, where Americans often turn for affordable clothing, and some familiar apparel brands may feel the pressure.\nThe Gap, an American clothing retailer that also operates Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, sources about 21% of its clothing from Vietnam, according to an analysis by Prof Sheng Lu at the University of Delaware's Fashion & Apparel Studies department. Another 37% of its clothing comes from India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\nH&M, known for its inexpensive fashions, manufactures most of its clothing in China and Bangladesh.\nThe tariffs could bring an \"unfair burden to American families, particularly lower-income households\", warned the US Fashion Industry Association in a statement on Wednesday.\nVietnam is open to working out a deal with the administration to avoid the tariffs, Trump has said. China, on the other hand, has retaliated with its own steep levies.\nAlmost all of the coffee consumed in the US comes from outside the country, meaning it could soon become a bigger burden on Americans' wallets.\nThe US mostly sources its coffee from Brazil and Colombia, which are subject to the baseline 10% tariffs. Vietnam is also a key exporter of certain varieties.\nWalter Haas, owner of San Francisco-based coffee roastery Graffeo, told the Washington Post that once tariffs hit, his company will feel it \"immediately\". \nIf they remain in place, those cost increases will be \"permanently baked into the price consumers pay\", he added.\nOther imported foods could similarly rise in price, especially those coming from European Union nations, who will all be hit by a 20% tariff. Prices of shelf staples such as olive oil, which is primarily imported from Italy, Spain and Greece, could rise further.\nShoes and trainers, among the most basic necessities and also one of Americans' biggest splurges, could become more expensive, including the popular Nike Air Force 1 and Adidas Samba trainers. Both sportswear companies rely heavily on Asian factory hubs for their inventories.\nAbout half of Nike and 39% of Adidas trainers are made in Vietnam.\nIn 2024, the US imported more than $27bn of footwear, mostly from China and Vietnam, which was subject to tariffs of about $3bn, according to data by Prof Lu. \nNow, that tax amount could nearly triple.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that, all in all, retailers may not be able to fully swallow the costs, and would need to raise prices by 10% to 12% to offset the levies on Vietnamese manufacturers.\nFrance is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of wine to the US, and its winemakers have expressed anxiety about what the 20% EU tariffs will mean for their business.\nThe Bourgogne Wine Board, which represents producers in the French region of Burgundy, said the US tariffs would deliver \"a serious blow\" to both exporters and American consumers.\n\"The risk with these additional tariffs is that they could push our wines past a psychological price threshold,\" warned Laurent Delaunay, president of the Bourgogne Wine Board - meaning above what buyers feel comfortable paying.\nPrice increases could be seen at restaurants, especially for imported beers or drinks using foreign spirits. Separately, Trump expanded an aluminium tariff to include all canned beer, which could also make it more expensive for those who stay home.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that large alcohol sellers would have to hike prices up to 5% to cover the tariffs if they choose not to absorb the costs themselves.\nCell phones, TVs and video game consoles tend to be big-ticket purchases, and the latest US tariffs could make them even bigger.\nChina, as well as Taiwan and South Korea, are all top exporters of electronics to the US.\nAlmost all iPhones are made in China, although some are also made in India (which, too, is on the \"worst offenders\" list with a 26% tariff). Samsung, meanwhile, has significant production operations in Vietnam.\nIt's still unclear how these major tech companies will respond to the new levies. But Japanese video gaming company Nintendo announced on Friday that it is delaying pre-orders of its Switch 2 console, saying it needs to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\"\nAmericans may soon find that loading up fast-fashion hauls from Chinese online retailers like Temu or Shein with a few swipes on their phones has gotten more expensive.\nAlong with imposing the country-level tariffs, Trump has signed an executive order ending an exemption that prevented charging the levies on small-dollar shipments from China. \nThe exemption is referred to as the \"de minimis\" loophole, and it had allowed shipments under $800 (\u00a3620) to enter the US duty-free. Experts say it was a big reason why Temu and Shein were able to keep their costs low.\nThe order means those companies may have to pay taxes for the first time on the clothes they often send directly to customers.\nIt is unclear just how much costs for these goods could rise with the elimination of the loophole, but the White House says small shipments sent to the US through the international postal network could be subject to a tax of \"either 30% of their value, or $25 per item.\"\nThat tax would then increase to $50 per item after 1 June, according to the White House.",

In response, the Australian highlighted the difference in the coverage of the two clubs.\n\"In the time I've been here, we've had two decisions that have gone for us against Liverpool and there has been a national campaign,\" he said.\nHe said it was telling the \"big story\" from the Chelsea defeat was his interaction with Spurs fans and how he has \"made things more difficult\" rather than about a match being \"materially changed by technology\".\nPostecoglou claimed this is part of a pattern of other major clubs having much more prominent pundit and ex-player voices in the media than Spurs.\n\"I never switch on the TV and hear any sort of strong voice,\" he said. \"The only voice you hear is me. When we're talking about the bigger clubs, there seem to be a lot more voices. \n\"There's never any sort of defending of the club or the club defending itself, which makes it even more difficult because every club goes through tough moments and it's how you react to them. \n\"That's a unique challenge, but I accepted that challenge so I've got to try to find a way to overcome it.\"\nWhen asked what Spurs could be doing better, Postecoglou said: \"By being more vocal. You probably hear too much from me, to be honest.\n\"It doesn't have to be just from people at the club. I hear plenty of people talking and defending other clubs. But it seems with Tottenham, wherever there's a sore, there's a real pile-on to sort of stick a finger in that sore and then we kind of accept our fate.\"\nHow does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nChelsea boost top-four hopes to pile pressure on Postecoglou\nThis video can not be played\nPutting phone in someone's face is bullying tactic - Postecoglou\nPostecoglou has also confronted individual supporters away at Fulham and at home against Leicester this season.\nHe defended those actions and said he will continue to stand up for what he believes is \"right\" by challenging those trying to goad him into a reaction on camera.\n\"For young people, a phone is more dangerous than any weapon in the world,\" he said.\n\"Why are you holding up a phone?

I hear plenty of people talking and defending other clubs. \"I'm just not at that stage in my life where I'm going to accept people trying to bully you or antagonise me or try to do things that show total disrespect. \"Can Postecoglou survive the heat?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Six minutes to come to a clear and obvious decision - Ange on VAR 'lottery'Spurs, who host bottom club Southampton on Sunday, are 14th in the Premier League table after 30 matches, 18 points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.Multiple sources have told BBC Sport that Postecolgou's position is under threat heading into the final weeks of the season as a consequence of a disappointing campaign.Winning the Europa League - which would be the club's first trophy since 2008 - would be a consideration in whether he remains in the job next season but well-placed sources have indicated it may not be the overriding factor.Tension between sections of the Spurs fanbase and Postecoglou is expected to be among the issues discussed when the time comes to decide his future.And Postecoglou's tense relationship with fans is expected be among the factors discussed when time comes to decide the manager's future.Also to be considered are the benefits of adopting a fresh approach under a new head coach to ensure the deficiencies that have contributed to such a poor campaign are not repeated.Postecoglou's future - and appointing a successor if a change is made - will be the most prominent issue for the Spurs hierarchy to resolve in the coming weeks.Asked if winning the Europa League is the only way to save his job, Postecoglou said: \"If people don't really see what I'm trying to do, then I don't think they're ever going to see it, so if a trophy is the only way - it seems to be the only way - OK, let's see if we can deliver that. \"It doesn't have to be just from people at the club.",

        "article_text": "Yoon Suk Yeol, who was officially removed from office on Friday, follows a line of former South Korean leaders who have had their reputations marred or terms interrupted by scandal. \nAmong them are presidents who have faced indictment, exile and imprisonment.\nYoon, who was South Korea's public prosecutor, in fact led a probe that landed former president Park Geun-hye in prison. \nNow apart from being impeached, Yoon is also being investigated for treason over his botched martial law attempt last December. Some analysts believe that, ironically, the move was driven by his fear of prosecution. \nHere is a list of former South Korean presidents whose political careers ended dramatically.\nBefore he became South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee spent some three decades as a pro-independence activist against Japanese rule. \nBut his presidency was polarising. \nWhile some respect him for having laid the foundations for a modern country after World War Two, critics condemn his authoritarian streak. Shortly after his inauguration in 1948, he implemented laws to curtail political dissent; he has also been blamed for the killing of civilians during the Korean War. \nThe opposition rejected Rhee's re-election in 1960 and accused him of rigging the vote. This escalated into violent student-led protests, which saw some demonstrators shot dead by police, and ultimately forced Rhee to resign. \nRhee left the country for Hawaii in May that year, where he died in 1965.\nBorn to a poor rural family in the early years of the Japanese occupation, Park Chung-hee joined the military and was posted to Manchuria (a historical region of north-eastern China) where he served until the Japanese surrendered.\nPark led a coup in 1961 to overthrow Rhee's successor, Chang Myon, and later became president. Park led the country for 18 years through a period of rapid economic development known as the \"miracle on the Han river\". It was during this time that the government opened doors to foreign investment, while also helping to develop now-famous conglomerates like Hyundai, LG and Samsung.\nHowever, he moved towards greater authoritarianism later in his term. In 1972, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and made himself \"president for life\". \nDespite Park's economic achievements, South Korea in the 1970s was rocked by growing protests against his iron-fisted rule, where dissenters were brutally punished.\nPark was assassinated at a dinner party in October 1979 by his own spy chief and lifelong friend Kim Jae-kyu. \nMilitary commander Chun Doo-hwan gained power in 1980 after yet another coup. He presided over a brutal military crackdown in the south-western city of Gwangju, which at the time was the centre of an uprising against martial law in South Korea. More than 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were either killed or disappeared.\nDuring Chun's term, the country saw growth rates hovering around 10% each year. However, he is mostly remembered as a dictator who was unapologetic till the end. \nIn 1983, Chun survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by North Korea forces, who bombed a ceremony he was at during a state visit to Myanmar. The attack killed 21 people and injured dozens more. \nIn 1988, Chun picked his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, also a former general, as his successor. \nThe pair were convicted in 1996 of corruption, as well as their roles in the coup and the Gwangju massacre. Defending the coup while on trial, Chun said he \"would take the same action, if the same situation arose\". \nChun was handed a death sentence - which was later commuted to life imprisonment - while Roh was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Both men were pardoned in 1997 after serving just two years in prison.\nBorn to a poor family, Roh Moo-hyun educated himself and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer without having attended law school. He was appointed a judge in 1977 but later left the bench to become a human rights lawyer, where he advocated for student activists accused of being pro-communist.\nIn 2002, Roh won the presidential election as an underdog, with early polls giving him just 2% of the vote. He tried to shape South Korea as a \"middle power\" among other stakeholders in the region, and championed a so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with trade and aid shipments. \nAfter leaving office in 2007, he returned to his hometown in the south-east and ran a duck farm. However, he took his own life 14 months later, as corruption investigators closed in over allegations he accepted $6m in bribes.\nPublic opinion on Roh improved considerably after his death. Polls by Gallup Korea have consistently ranked him the most beloved president in the country's history.\nFormer Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak entered politics in 1992 and was elected mayor of Seoul a decade later. He won the election by a landslide in 2007, even though a business scandal from his days at the automobile conglomerate resurfaced in the days leading up to the vote.\nLee led the country through the global financial crisis and won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. His term ended in 2013, and he was succeeded by the country's first female president Park Geun-hye, who is the daughter of assassinated former leader Park Chung-hee. \nThe younger Park drew on her father's reputation as the man who pulled South Korea out of poverty. However, a corruption scandal involving a confidante, Choi Soon-sil - the daughter of a Shamanistic cult leader - led to her impeachment in 2016 and arrest a year later.\nFive years after leaving office, Lee too was charged with bribery and later found guilty of creating slush funds of tens of millions of dollars, and taking bribes from various sources, including Samsung. \nPark was handed a 22-year sentence and Lee 15 years, but both have since been pardoned.

        "article_text": "Sam was lying in bed one morning when her tenant in a house she owned in Margate sent her a photo of a piece of graffiti that had appeared on the wall outside.\nAstonishingly, it looked like a Banksy. It would turn out to be perhaps the graffiti artist's most interesting new artwork of recent years,\u202fValentine's Day Mascara (pictured above), which was revealed in Margate on Valentine's Day, 2023.\nBamboozled, Sam googled: what do you do when you wake up with a Banksy on your wall?\n\"What did Google say about that?\" I asked her.\n\"Nothing! And I was like, I need to contact the council, I need to find an art gallery who can advise me.\"\nSam called Julian Usher at Red Eight Gallery. Julian's team, conscious that new Banksys are under immediate threat from street cleaners, the weather, rival graffiti artists and other art dealers, promised he'd be in Margate within the hour: \"We knew we had to get the piece covered,\" say Julian.\nAnd there was another reason Julian got to Margate double-quick: if Banksy chooses your wall for one of his drawings, you could be seriously in the money.\nFor the second season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast The Banksy Story, which is called When Banksy Comes To Town, I've been following the very different fates of two sets of homeowners who wake up one day to find a Banksy on their wall. The season shows just how important his graffiti becomes for a local community \u2013 and why people disagree so vehemently about what should happen after it's discovered.\nSam became the custodian of\u202fValentine's Day Mascara, which speaks to the theme of domestic violence, incidents of which usually spike each Valentine's Day. It's a complicated bit of work. A peppy 50s housewife with a black eye has bludgeoned her partner. A real pan with flecks of red is at her feet, and his painted legs are upended into the real fridge-freezer that Banksy left by the wall. A broken plastic chair testifies to the fight they have had.\nLater on the day it appeared, refuse collectors arrived to spirit away the fridge-freezer. This precipitated a free-for-all, with the public helping themselves to the remnants. It was mayhem. \nA media scrum, a wrong-footed local council, millions of global onlookers. Exactly, one suspects, what Banksy wanted. \nAnd this time, just for laughs, he left behind oil painter Peter Brown, commissioned to capture the scenes he would miss. I spoke to Pete \"The Street\" Brown for my series. \"The whole reason I was employed was because Banksy was questioning what was the art about,\" Pete explained. \"Is it about the graffiti? Or is it about the reaction afterwards, and what happens to it?\"\nAs luck would have it, Pete was captured on video just as Banksy's team were putting the finishing touches to Valentine's Day Mascara \u2013 a video that The Banksy Story managed to obtain. In it we can see that one of Banksy's team let a local kid play with their drone. \n\"They're in the process of putting a large piece on a wall and yet they're taking the time to teach a kid how to fly a drone,\" says Steph Warren, who used to work with Banksy and who appeared in my first series - about the artist's rise and rise. \"Very sweet!\"\nAlongside Sam, I've been following the story of Gert and Gary. They, like Sam, did not want me to use their last name. A 30ft-high seagull appeared one morning on the wall of their buy-to-let in Lowestoft in Suffolk. The bird needed to be massive for Banksy's ambitious visual gag to work. The artist had shoved large yellow insulation strips into a skip that now looked like a fast-food container that the seagull divebombed to steal chips.\nBanksy had chosen his wall well. Visitors arriving by train were treated to this witty meditation on the scourge of Britain's seaside towns, equal parts warning and celebration. The\u202fLowestoft Seagull\u202fwas part of Banksy's\u202fGreat British Staycation, his post-Covid lockdown campaign to cheer us all up at the prospect of a summer holiday spent in the UK.\nBut Gert was not cheered-up at all. \"It's not a seagull, it's an albatross!\" she quipped when I went to interview her.\n\"How did you know it was a Banksy?\" I asked.\n\"There was scaffolding erected on the side of the house. I tried to find out if it was a particular scaffolding firm, but there was no phone number,\" Gert replied. \"On the Monday morning the letting agency informed me that I could possibly have a Banksy. By then the scaffolding had gone and this seagull appeared.\"\nThis fits with what we know of Banksy's modus operandi. He claims hiding in plain sight is the best way to remain invisible. \"If questioned about your legitimacy,\" he wrote in his book Wall & Piece, \"simply complain about the hourly rate.\"\nIt's a good gag. But how fun is it for the folk on the other end of his spray can?\nI found that with good hustling skills a Banksied homeowner might see their bank balance expanded, but it's not an easy process. \nAs Gert explains, exasperated, \"Lowestoft people commented that it belongs to Lowestoft\u2026 But nobody's turned up to say, 'we'll help you protect it'. It doesn't belong to the person filming it, or the person taking pictures with their children. The problem is mine!\" \nGert had to contend with people putting their children into the skip for photo opportunities, the council trying to charge her for Perspex screens, and the threat of a Preservation Order which might have cost her \u00a340,000 a year.\nAnd the two stories I've been following have ended up having entirely different outcomes. \nBoth artworks have been taken off the houses they were painted on \u2013 a complex, expensive operation that uses specialist equipment \u2013 so they can be sold. But while the Banksy in Margate is now on the verge of selling for well over \u00a31m, with a sizeable chunk set to go to a domestic violence charity, and with the piece remaining in the town for the foreseeable future, the Banksy up the coast in Lowestoft languishes in a climate-controlled warehouse, costing its owners \u00a33,000 per month. \nIt has cost Gert and her partner Gary around \u00a3450,000 so far to preserve the piece and although there are buyers sniffing around, nobody has bought it yet. Speaking about the situation, Gary told me: \"I'm so angry at what's going on.\"\nNot everyone approves of people trying to sell Banksy's street art. \nSteph Warren \u2013 who starred in the first series of The Banksy Story\u202fas the only person ever to work for Banksy without signing his non-disclosure agreement \u2013 suggests that worried homeowners should simply \"get busy with five litres of white emulsion and paint it out\".\nOwner of street-art gallery Stelladore in St Leonards, Warren is a purist, who feels that art made for the street should remain there, no matter its value. \"With Banksy, where he puts the art is fundamental,\" she says. \"Remove the work from the precise place on the streets that he put it, and the work instantly loses its power. Context is everything.\"\nBut Banksy has elevated graffiti into a new art form, now monetised \u2013 street art. Banksy's signed prints can sell for six-figure sums. Graffiti, or street art, has not just come of age, it is now an asset class. Given this, how can any homeowner feel okay about scrubbing away a Banksy without feeling as if they have smashed a Ming vase?\nOne thing I know for sure: if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall, you'll have to make a series of clever decisions to come out of it unscathed. As Sam says, after two years of dealing with the Banksy circus, \"going back to normal life now is going to be terribly boring\".",

        "article_text": "\"Je m'appelle Luis Enrique.\" \nThat's how the Paris St-Germain manager introduced himself to the cameras in Paris back in July 2023.\nBut beyond that, he keeps his French private - except for his favourite phrase: on va gagner (\"we're going to win\"). \nThat pretty much sums the Spaniard up: Honest, direct and not one for show. \nLuis Enrique doesn't perform. He is intense, an obsessive and he lets the work speak for itself.\nAnd what work it has been, transforming PSG from a star-studded squad to a collective, cohesive and resilient unit.\nSaturday's win against Angers secured back-to-back Ligue 1 titles for Luis Enrique's PSG, as they remain unbeaten in the league all season.\nThey still have a chance of repeating last season's domestic treble and, with a Champions League quarter-final coming up against Aston Villa, a first European title is a serious possibility.\nWinning titles is nothing new to the French champions but Luis Enrique has helped turn them from a team long associated with egos and big-money into a vibrant, youthful and thrilling team to watch.\nSo how have PSG and Luis Enrique finally started to win over the neutrals?\nTragedy, withdrawal & ruthlessness: The Luis Enrique story\nLuis Enrique is World Cup winner on Twitch with live Q&As\nPSG beat Angers to clinch Ligue 1 title with six games left\nLife has hit Luis Enrique hard.\nIn 2019, he lost his nine-year-old daughter Xana to a rare form of bone cancer. \nHe has spoken about her with remarkable calm. \"Her body is gone,\" he said, \"but she hasn't died. She's still with us.\"\nIn a deeply moving documentary, he talked about visiting his mother.\n\"My mother couldn't keep photos of Xana. Until I came home and asked, 'Why are there no photos of Xana, Mom?' 'I can't, I can't\u2026,' she used to say. 'Mom, you have to put up photos of Xana, Xana is alive,' I replied.\"\n\"Physically, she may not be here, but spiritually she is. Because every day we talk about her, we laugh, and we remember because I think Xana still sees us.\"\nIn her memory, he and his wife have launched a foundation to help families of terminally ill children - especially those who can't afford to stop working during their child's final months. \nIt's an act of love and fierce purpose. Like everything he does.\nHe is a man grounded in more ways than one.\nFor over two years, he's walked barefoot most mornings on the grass of the pitches of the PSG training ground. \nHe's convinced that 'earthing' helps him avoid spring allergies and reconnect with something deeper. \nHe's strict with his body, too. He stretches every 30 minutes at the training ground, trains daily - even at home sometimes, weaving between sofas and walls - and has turned both house and office into functional gyms, with straps and bars hanging from ceilings and walls.\nHe enjoys surfing, swimming, endurance running and long cycle rides up the steep climbs of Spain's Picos de Europa. \nIn 2007, he completed the Frankfurt Ironman challenge - a 2.4-mile swim, a 118-mile cycle and a full marathon. The following year, he ran the legendary Marathon de Sables, a 155-mile race over six days in the Sahara desert.\n\"I only know how to compete,\" he said to himself when he retired from playing in 2004. Managing was the only option for the former Barcelona and Spain forward.\nAs a coach, Luis Enrique has copied the philosophy of his former team-mate Pep Guardiola from the beginning. \nHe hasn't brought anything truly new to the table, but, using the tonnes of energy he has, he has become one of the top representatives of a broader cultural shift.\nHis relentless edge is now driving everything at Paris St-Germain, although initially he didn't even want the job.\nHe thought the club only cared about names. Players such as Neymar, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe. Uncoachable, he assumed. \nBut when he heard the philosophy had changed - that they now wanted to build a team - he reconsidered. \nAnd, soon after he arrived, Neymar and Marco Verratti were gone. Messi, who might have stayed had he known Luis Enrique was coming, had already committed to Inter Miami.\nHe understands and appreciates the importance of individual stars, but only up to a point. \nIn a recent documentary about his first season at PSG, he was seen warning Mbappe, his star player at the time, about his obligation to fulfil his defensive duties - just after the player had scored a hat-trick.\n\"He's the best player in the world,\" the Asturian insisted several times. \"But if the team with the best player in the world always won, PSG would have eight Champions League titles and they haven't had any.\"\nHe is a manager who respects structure, but is never afraid to speak his mind. \n\"I'm not afraid of the worst in football... if they sack me, no problem,\" he said. \"The next day, I'll go for a cycling trip.\" \nIt's that perspective that helped him ride out a rocky start last season - including a 4\u20131 loss to Newcastle in the Champions League and heavy criticism from the supporters.\nBut he stayed calm and kept faith in his footballing beliefs. Structure, repetition, and positional discipline. \nHis dream? One day, managers will have mics in the stands and be able to talk players through their positions during a match.\nHe had to rewire a squad addicted to chaos when he arrived in Paris.\nSo he spent little time in an office, instead sitting with his assistants, working directly with his players and embedding his ideas.\nSome players push back against his intensity. Mbappe, for example, didn't love being boxed in as a number nine or publicly challenged after a hat-trick.\nBut others thrive, because he doesn't do favourites.\nHe could not care less if the media don't like him. \nThe three-part documentary about his life is titled You Lot Haven't Got A Clue - a message to the media and a window into how little their opinions affect him. \nHe admitted, if it were up to him, he would take a 50% pay cut if that meant he would not have to speak to the media again. \n\"I don't read the opinions of the journalists,\" he once said, \"not because of a lack of respect, but because, logically, they haven't dedicated even 10% of the time, nor do they have the information, that my staff and I have on any given issue.\"\nAnd there lies another contradiction - a coach unwilling to give one-on-one interviews, yet prepared to expose himself for all to see in a documentary.\nNot for the first time, either.\nNothing was off-limits when, during the World Cup in Qatar, much of Spain was glued to their computer screens as Luis Enrique, then in charge of the national team, spent hours on Twitch answering questions on all aspects of his life as far ranging as why he ate six eggs a day, hated cheese and slept naked.\nHis reasons for his regular streams were the same as why he agreed to the documentary: to offer his most honest version and let people judge. \n\nDiscipline, injuries & family - how Dembele turned career around\nForward Ousmane Dembele has been one of PSG's success stories.\nLast summer, Luis Enrique gave him a mission to score more goals. The message was clear: be more selfish and shoot more. \nDembele listened. He's now thriving in a central role, playing as a false nine, more involved in the build-up, getting more touches, more shots, more goals. \nHe's not the erratic winger from his Barcelona days. He's focused. And the goals have flowed, having now scored 32 goals in all competitions this season.\nFor Luis Enrique, failure isn't trying and falling short. It's failing to give everything.\nHe has carried the belief that football isn't life or death since his playing days. He'll never shed a tear over a defeat. \nWhen it became clear that Mbappe was leaving last summer, he said something that may come to define his PSG reign.\n\"The team will play better,\" he said. No longer forced to design a side around one star, he felt liberated. \"Next year,\" he thought, \"I'm going to control everything that happens on the pitch.\"\nAnd this is very much his PSG, a team that many believe could achieve their dream of finally winning the Champions League.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Rory McIlroy's Augusta troubles started on the 10th hole of the final round in 2011 with a wayward drive into the trees down the left\nIt is often referred to as the most important distance in golf; the five inches between the ears.\nThe game is as much a test of temperament as technique and champions at the very highest level have to conquer both elements to land the biggest titles.\nIn their pomp the likes of Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood had the physical attributes to win any tournament they played. But something would always get in the way when it came to the majors; the big four tournaments that define careers.\nThere was always a stumbling block at the Masters, The Open, the US Open or US PGA Championship. It prevented them, and many others, from producing their best shots when they most needed them.\nIt is not a slight to say this. It's golf. The mental challenge of pulling off key shots when the only inhibiter is the pressure of the moment encapsulates the magic of the game.\nIt will be evident in abundance again this week as Rory McIlroy embarks on his latest attempt to complete the career Grand Slam. He is among the world's best who are all gathering together for the first time in eight months for the Masters at Augusta National.\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\nMcIlroy can cope with Masters pressure - Mickelson\nMcIlroy dealing with elbow issue before Masters\nThese major weeks are the ultimate individual examination and for all his prolific form at tour level, McIlroy has failed to add to his tally of four major wins since 2014.\nWe wonder why Westwood and Monty never won a major, why it took Phil Mickelson until his 13th year on tour to land his first win on this elevated stage but the most burning current question surrounds McIlroy's frustrations - the majors and most pertinently the Masters.\nSo precocious was the Northern Irishman's talent when he first competed as a teenager in 2009 he was asked about completing the Grand Slam by the age of 22.\nTwo years on at Augusta he led by four shots going into the final round, only to shoot 80 in a scarring denouement. Despite four subsequent top-five finishes, he has never since embarked on the final day back nine with a real chance of glory.\n\"The biggest challenge for Rory is the mental one,\" said Paul McGinley. The former Ryder Cup captain's Golf Channel colleague, Brandel Chamblee, added of the Masters. \"It is literally his nemesis, It brings out the worst golf in Rory annually.\"\nMcIlroy dropped six shots in three holes in the final round as his hopes of winning the 2011 Masters evaporated\nThe popular view is that McIlroy suffers from a build up of mental scar tissue, first triggered by that Augusta capitulation in 2011.\nAlthough he quickly started collecting his quartet of majors, post 2014 there have been many instances where further setbacks have added to the malaise. Most recent was last year's US Open where he was beaten by to the title by Bryson DeChambeau despite leading by two with five holes to play.\n\"It is possible for people to build something up in their heads and say this is the one that I struggle with because previously something bad happened,\" chartered psychologist Stephen Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"That memory hasn't been processed properly out of what we call the short term executive memory into your long term memory. \n\"And it's literally interfering with the performance message from the higher order brain. \n\"It's almost like a mini form of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).\"\nSmith has worked with athletes across a wide range of sports and says bad memories can influence physical performance.\n\"The wire that carries the performance movement message from your brain to your body gets that wonderful swing going in a connected way,\" he said.\n\"And that's why you make more mistakes on that hole or on that course or in that tournament, because you're just literally not able to send the signal to the muscles. It's getting interfered with by what you would call scar tissue.\"\nNot since that ill-fated tilt in 2011, when he began with a 65, has McIlroy made a dominant start to the Masters. He has only broken 70 on one occasion - a 69 in 2018 when he finished tied fifth behind Patrick Reed after a final round 74.\nIn this period he has won at every level, including the prestigious Players Championship twice. The second of those Sawgrass wins occurred only last month and that combined with a fine win at Pebble Beach in February is fuelling optimism for this week.\nThe now 35-year-old is second favourite behind defending champion Scottie Scheffler, who has yet to win this year. Indeed, of all the biggest names, McIlroy has had the most successful start to the year.\nStars are aligning for him to win the one major to elude him.\nVictory this week would put him alongside the all time greats; Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods - the only golfers to have won all four majors and completed the Grand Slam collection.\nMcIlroy is desperate to wear the famous Green Jacket, but can you want it too much?  \n\"That's a very good point,\" said Smith.\n\"All of this is said without me ever having spoken to Rory, I couldn't comment as to how accurate my views on the situation are.\n\"But looking at it from outside the goldfish bowl that is tournament golf, you look at it and say, OK, right, maybe that's it, it could be that he actually wants it too much.\"\nMcIlroy has been working with sports psychologist Bob Rotella in the build up to his 17th attempt at winning the Masters. \"I think he'll have him very well prepared now,\" McGinley said.\n\"They've had two or three runs at this now, and I think they will be coming up with a plan in terms of taking that pressure and decimating it and putting it aside.\"\nSmith believes the answer lies in reaffirming good memories, such as McIlroy's imperious opening drive in his three-hole play-off win over JJ Spaun at the Players three weeks ago. The champion admitted to being very nervous before that tee shot.\nNicklaus, winner of a record 18 majors, used to insist he never missed a short putt in the sport's biggest championships, which was not true but a valuable technique to reaffirm confidence. Woods would celebrate fine shots with a trademark move with his club.\n\"Tiger with his club twirl,\" said Smith, who is an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society. \"It's a hard copy down of the good stuff into the long-term memory so he can draw on it.\n\"I know that I can do it. I know that I've won.\"\nAnd while the notion of accumulated mental scar tissue is potentially ruinous, Smith believes that McIIroy is at a prime age to deal with any such issue.\n\"His emotional intelligence is growing, immensely,\" he said. \"He is not the man he was was when he was 29 or 30.\"\nAnd in 2025, McIlroy - without yet playing at his very best - looks assured. Using a different ball this year his technique, especially in his approach play, looks better nuanced and more effective.\nSo this might just be the year for the man with 28 PGA Tour wins, but no major victories in his past 38 attempts. He is playing the best golf of any of the leading contenders, but this week carries a mental burden far greater than any of his rivals.\nIt is the bit between the ears.\n\"You've got to own it because if you don't it'll just niggle away at you,\" Smith said. \"So you've got to almost burst that cyst, excise it, clean it out,  deal with it.\"",

        "article_text": "Five years on from Megxit, as the Duchess of Sussex builds her new lifestyle empire, her viewing figures are high but, in the UK at least, popularity levels are low. So, ahead of the release of her new podcast tomorrow, experts ask whether anything she does can win wider appeal?\nListen to Daniela read this article \n\"The problem is that people are much more interested in the royal gossip than they are in learning how to make a jam.\" The Countess of Sandwich gets to the crux of what she sees as the Duchess of Sussex's rebrand dilemma.\nAs an American woman who married into the British aristocracy back in 2004, the countess knows firsthand the challenge of slipping between two cultures.\nWhen I first spoke to her about this - long before \"Megxit\" - she was positive that Meghan would win over the nation. \"Having this American optimism and this go-get attitude, that is what you guys kind of like about us, right?\" she told me.\nSeven years on, the countess remains optimistic about Meghan's progress. \"As an American, I look at her and I think she's a hustler. She's taking these opportunities, using them as stepping stones to get to where she wants to go.\" \nOnly not everyone appears to agree. In the UK, Meghan's popularity rating was just 19% at the start of 2025 according to a YouGov poll, down from 26% a year earlier. (In the US, the view is slightly more favourable, sitting at 43% in January 2025.)\nHer recent Netflix lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan, which featured her upcycling supermarket bouquets and scenting flannels with lavender water, wasn't received entirely warmly either. \nDespite it being the tenth most watched Netflix programme globally in its first week, audiences gave it a rating of just 33% on the film and television review website, Rotten Tomatoes (based on more than 2,500 votes).\nThis was followed by the launch of her new brand As Ever, selling, among other things, \u00a311 ($14) edible flower petals and jars of \u00a321.50 ($28) wildflower honey. These sold out within a day, yet this too was met by criticism in some quarters \u2014 with prices being lambasted and some questioning whether Meghan had a clear vision for the brand.\nNow, she is set to host a new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, which launches tomorrow. In an Instagram post, she wrote with some excitement: \"I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities.\" But the question now is how will this be received.\nAnd, as her era of brand builder, lifestyle influencer, and businesswoman steams on, what will it really take for her to broaden her popularity and win over those who are circumspect - or downright negative? \nOr could it be that no matter how successful her bottom line or however pioneering her next project, a wider issue is holding back the possibility of broader appeal - and if that really is the case, how to shrug that off?\nIt has been five years since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked out of Westminster Abbey, after the annual Commonwealth Service, and into a life away from royal duty.\nAs the couple's grand finale in the UK, it made the optics around the service incredibly tense. Even the question of how the royal party should enter the Abbey became a sticking point.\nThe printed order of service did not include Prince Harry and Meghan in the official royal arrival. The plan had been for them to take their seats earlier, and for Elizabeth II to lead a small procession of senior royals into the Abbey slightly later. However this decision upset the couple, according to those planning the service.\nIt was eventually decided, in order to diffuse the situation, that the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales (back then, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) would not walk behind the Queen either. Instead, like Prince Harry and Meghan, they would take their seats earlier.\nSomeone who attended the service that day described it to me as \"deeply uncomfortable\".\nThe friction set the mood for the years ahead. And though Meghan has only made two visits to the UK since 9 March 2020, and her life is now firmly rooted in her home state of California, the impact continues, according to some experts.\nAccording to Evan Nierman, a US-based public relations guru: \"Whatever she does to distance herself, it comes back to Buckingham Palace and her relationship with the Royal Family.\"\nMark Borkowski, founder of the UK-based Borkowski communications agency, also believes that whatever Meghan does next, it will always be filtered through \"the royal lens\". \"Even when Meghan is launching jam or Harry is speaking about mental health, the coverage returns to the same question: are they thriving or failing in their post-royal life?\" \nThere have been questions around choices the couple have made since leaving the UK, too, particularly around the polarising interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, and through the publication of Prince Harry's memoir Spare in 2023.\nOne source who has worked with them described this as \"brave and idiotic\".\nWith that chapter behind them, it was natural that they would focus on new income streams that don't involve talking about the Royal Family. But as Mr Nierman, founder of Red Banyan Public Relations in the US, puts it: \"She's trying to stand out on her own, but she has this level of notoriety and fame that is inextricably linked to the Royal Family.\" \nMuch of the response to Meghan, positive or negative, \"is driven by her marriage to Prince Harry and her ties to the Royal Family\", argues James Crawford, managing director of PR Agency One. \"That connection shapes how everything she does is received.\"\nEarly indications are that though her public popularity may not be sky-high, this is not necessarily translating into lack of business success.\nSome critics, though, tell another story. Tina Brown, the former Vanity Fair editor, put her own review somewhat harshly, concluding that Meghan has an \"unerring instinct for getting it wrong\". \nOn the Netflix series, which was released on 4 March, she added: \"Meghan has come out with a show about fake perfection just when the zeitgeist has turned raucously against it.\"\nOther criticism has also focused on a perceived lack of relatability, in a show that was designed to revolve around the duchess casually sharing hosting tips with friends.\n\"High on gloss, low on human connection,\" said British Vogue. \"Toe-curlingly unlovable TV,\" said The Guardian, while The Telegraph, somewhat cruelly, called the series an \"exercise in narcissism\".\nRoyal author Sally Beddell Smith, meanwhile, feels that the approach itself was a misstep. \"What mystifies me is why not relaunch The Tig,\" she says, referring to the lifestyle website that Meghan once ran. \n\"It had brand loyalty and was easily identifiable. She did it well. It was snappy, it had a reason to exist. It could have really given her a leg up. Why not reignite it?\"\nAnd yet negative responses will not have surprised Prince Harry and Meghan, according to people who work with the couple. They were, I'm told, braced for criticism.\nAnd there were positive responses too, particularly outside the UK. \"Some international press praised the show's warm, feel-good tone and visual polish, seeing it as a natural return to Meghan's pre-royal lifestyle roots,\" points out Mr Crawford. \n\"Likewise, her brand has been well received in some quarters for its positioning and premium aesthetic.\"\nWith Love, Meghan was far from a disaster in the ratings, with 2.6 million views in its first week. Though this was well behind the launch of a sci-fi drama, Halo: Season One, which had 4.2 million views in the same period, experts point out that such comparisons are perhaps unfair. \n\"I would never have predicted it to be right at the top of charts,\" argues Adam Miller, TV editor of Metro. \"A lifestyle show is never going to be at the top against a drama or a thriller... For Netflix, I reckon it's about as expected.\"\nWhat's more, With Love, Meghan was never going to change opinions of those who are already, for whatever reason, predisposed against her - just as her new podcast series is unlikely to. \nExisting Meghan fans will likely enjoy the programme. For those who don't like Meghan, the series is likely to irritate. And according to some experts, a Marmite effect is no bad thing. \n\"In today's polarised media landscape, divisiveness isn't always a disadvantage,\" argues PR guru Mr Crawford.\nThe wider question is how to respond to it. And Meghan's recent approach has become more direct. After podcaster Amanda Hirsch posted a picture of the Netflix series trailer with the caption: \"You guys I'm scared for Meghan,\" the duchess allegedly responded with a handwritten note. \n\"Dear Amanda, I heard you are feeling scared,\" the note reads. \"Don't be. This is the fun part \u2014 let's enjoy it.\"\nLikewise, she responded with humour to rumours of a potential feud with actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow.\nIn an Instagram video, Ms Paltrow remarked: \"I genuinely do not understand this at all, whatsoever.\" She then turned her head to ask someone off screen: \"Do you understand this?\" The actress revealed Meghan sitting beside her, who shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, while eating a piece of pie.\nIt was a marketing triumph - a sign that, while she's taking notice, she knows what is really needed. That is, a fresh approach - and that's what Meghan the businesswoman is all about.\nAway from business, life for the couple in California is largely a private one. Their multi-million dollar home in Montecito, around two hours drive up the coast from Los Angeles, is secluded and well-guarded and they have kept their circle of loyal friends tight - among them, tennis star Serena Williams, as well as actress Abigail Spencer.\nMeghan has talked about bonding with parents of her children's friends too, describing nights out, Pilates classes and sharing children's parties.\nWhen the couple go out for dinner, however, they are mostly left to themselves. Chef Vikram Vij has a restaurant in Vancouver where he says the couple have dined on several occasions. \"Everybody knew they were there but they weren't disturbed,\" says Mr Vij.\n\"They were both aware and so respectful of every person that came in contact with them,\" he adds. \"They took the time to say hello to us as a kitchen [and] paid the whole bill for themselves and their security, which I thought was very respectful.\"\nYet for every positive story comes a negative one \u2013 with contradictory claims of less positive experiences from those who have worked with and known the couple.\n\"The atmosphere around Harry and Meghan is so febrile,\" says Vanity Fair contributing editor, Anna Peele, who spent months working on a piece about the couple.\nMore recently, a row around the running of Sentebale, the charity that Prince Harry co-founded in honour of his late mother, has escalated into a bitter dispute, which will now be investigated by the Charity Commission. \nInsiders and those who have worked at Sentebale have been robust in their defence of Prince Harry and Meghan, and critical of accusations.\nBut though this is largely a story about Prince Harry and his charity work, there is a Meghan element to it too, suggesting she is still not able to disentangle herself and her brand from interest in the Royal Family.\nThe question of where Meghan and Prince Harry go from here is up for debate. \"They keep trying new things,\" argues Ms Peele. \"Harry and Meghan have the best of intentions but intentions doesn't always mean impact.\"\nMr Niemar, meanwhile, believes that the best way to address this is to shake off the past and keep doing what they are already doing.\n\"They got what they were after - global fame exposed what they felt they needed to do,\" he says. \"But you can only ride that train for so long\u2026 She's doing the right thing trying to carve out something new.\"\nHowever their next steps require careful consideration. For royal author Sally Bedell Smith, it's no longer just about where Meghan pivots next, but how Prince Harry fits into that. \"Do they scale back and live in a more modest way? Does Harry throw himself into the cause of helping veterans and do things in a quiet way and at a lower key?\"\nWith a pause she adds: \"He's now a spare to his wife.\"\nAnd yet many royal watchers are optimistic that, despite some negative reviews of late, their path ahead will be a success. \"It's never too late to turn things around,\" says Katie Nicholl, journalist and author of The New Royals. \n\"But there's a sense that these two need to listen to their advisers, focus on the next five years and really have a concrete plan... Hollywood is a hard town to crack and they've proved that royal titles alone aren't enough to guarantee success.\"\nWhat that success could look like is a bigger question still. Some have mooted a return to acting for Meghan, who previously starred in the legal drama, Suits, though no one I spoke to recently felt this was realistic. (Although a cameo on the reboot of Suits, which will be set in Los Angeles, would cause a stir.)\n\"She's not the same person she was on Suits. She's not the American girl at the Palace,\" argues Ms Peele. \"She has evolved.\" So far, this involves being a business mogul, lifestyle entrepreneur and content creator.\nBut Katie Nicholl believes that much of their potential now lies away from lifestyle programming and media deals. \n\"While they need to be commercially successful, I think much of their success depends on their philanthropy, on really developing their Archewell Foundation and using their global spotlight for good.\n\"That's where they really have impact and stand out.\"\nTop picture credit: Getty Images.

        "article_text": "Alejandro Garnacho (second left) posed with Amad Diallo, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund after Manchester United's FA Cup final win last season\nAlejandro Garnacho has a bit of history with Manchester City.\nLast season, he scored the opening goal as Manchester United stunned their local rivals in the FA Cup final - later posing with the trophy along with his youthful team-mates Amad Diallo, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund.\nJust over two months later he was back on target at Wembley when he scored in the Community Shield against this weekend's Manchester derby opponents - the first of eight goals in his first 20 games of the season.\nBut then things took a downturn.\nGarnacho did not face City on 15 December after being dropped along with fellow forward Marcus Rashford.\nHead coach Ruben Amorim spoke about it being a selection issue following an evaluation of \"training performance, game performance, engagement with team-mates\".\n\"I pay attention to everything,\" he said. \"The way you eat, the way you put your clothes to go to a game.\"\nUnlike Rashford, who returned to the squad just once and did not play again before joining Aston Villa on loan in February, Garnacho was recalled immediately. \nSources said the issue came down to an interpretation of his reaction to receiving instruction as he waited to come on in a Europa League game\nAmorim believed Garnacho wasn't listening. Garnacho felt he was, while watching the game unfold.\nNew in the job, Amorim felt he had to lay down a marker. Garnacho's speedy return - and continued presence - confirms the matter has been dealt with and forgotten.\nBut his performance levels have dipped. In 21 appearances since the City game, Garnacho has scored one goal and created four.\nAnd after another frustrating performance against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday - during which he had six unsuccessful shots and was shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away in anger - his future became the focus of fan discussion.\nCan you name people to play for Man Utd & City?\nGarnacho has scored four goals in 29 Premier League appearances this season - making him United's third-top scorer. He has nine goals and eight assists in all competitions\nHe has created 26 chances - putting him outside top 50 in the Premier League.\nGarnacho has attempted 65 dribbles but only completed 20 - 75th among Premier League players.\nHis 68 shots in the league is the 11th highest total, but with a very low conversion rate of 5.9%.\nGarnacho is in the top 10 for carries ending in shots (24) and 20th for carries ending in a chance created (15).\nHe has completed 30.8% successful dribbles - the lowest of any Premier League player to have attempted 50 or more.\nGarnacho's possession won, interceptions, sprints and tackles have dropped under Amorim compared to under Erik ten Hag this season; but his possession won in the final third and distance covered per match stats have improved.\nSpeaking to sources around United, a few key points emerge.\nGarnacho's confidence is at a low ebb. Someone with high-level coaching experience, who understands the demands players face at a club of that stature, suggests he is 'nervous'. It is a trait first spotted when he was breaking into the first team.\nThe Argentine is viewed as a player who is at his best when his mind is free. The belief is he is now over-thinking, meaning he snatches at chances.\nUnited legend Paul Scholes - now a pundit - has previously described Garnacho as \"scruffy\" technically and said his decision-making is \"really poor\" at times.\nIt is acknowledged from sources inside the club that Garnacho is feeling the strain, and he was pictured slapping his head in frustration after one wasted shot on Tuesday.\nThis is the first extended dip of Garnacho's career. While to many he 'arrived' with his brilliant bicycle kick at Everton in November 2023, he actually made his debut in April 2022.\nTuesday's game was Garnacho's 132nd for United - 46 of which have been this season. If he stays injury free and remains at the club, he could become one of the youngest United players to reach 200 appearances.\nAll have come during tumultuous times at Old Trafford, and it is worth remembering, too, that he is just 20.\nAs a 'homegrown' player, Garnacho remains one of United's most valuable assets. \nThe Football Transfers website values him at \u00a355m - ninth in the list of under-21 players globally.\nIt is a year ago since United headed towards the summer transfer window in a delicate position with the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and let it be known they would consider offers for any of their players, aside from Garnacho, Mainoo and Hojlund, who were 'untouchable'. \nThat status was quietly removed before the January 2025 window.\nGarnacho was the subject of sustained interest from Napoli and Chelsea. Garnacho and his camp were aware of it. They also knew that while they weren't pushing him out of the door, United's hierarchy were not exactly putting the lock and bolt on.\nQuite how close a deal came to being struck is not clear, but could certainly be unsettling for the player.\nGarnacho went from being a central component of Ten Hag's squad to becoming part of the answer to United's PSR problems, with any fee being banked as 'pure profit'.\nHe could hardly be blamed for wondering if his future lay elsewhere.\nGarnacho's 'heatmap' under Erik ten Hag in the Premier League this season\nGarnacho's 'heatmap' under Ruben Amorim in the Premier League this season\n1 of 2\nIt is clear Garnacho's best position - and his preferred role - is as a wide attacking player. \nBut it is a role that does not exist in Amorim's formation, where wing-backs provide the width and inside forwards the penetration. \nHe is trying to adapt - and Amorim's selections and recent quotes suggest he wants him to - but the process is not straightforward.\nOn Friday, he said: \"I think he is doing the right things. Like any player in our team, has to choose better, especially in the last third.\n\"Garnacho is improving the way he defends, the way he runs. He needs more goals and assists, that is clear. He wants to improve and is improving but is not in a great moment.\"\nLast month, the Portuguese said it was \"clear\" Garnacho had talent but he needed to \"learn to play a little bit in a different position\".\n\"He's finding the best way to play in this system. He's improving during training, and I think he changed the way he sees himself. I am trying to find the best position for him.\"\nThe decline in his effectiveness has been spotted elsewhere. After being a regular in the Argentina squad as part of the Copa America win last summer, he was left out for the most recent World Cup qualifiers.\nGarnacho's 26 chances created in the Premier League this season - including his only assist\nGarnacho is not hiding on the pitch, but does shun the limelight off it.\nHe has a young partner and child at home, with his wider family in Spain.\nSources told BBC Sport Garnacho is dedicated and showing maturity - reporting to training an hour before Amorim's start time of 10am for individual gym work.\nThough he does not tend to do many external interviews, he has worked hard on his English since he arrived in September 2020 and spent his first weeks in isolation because of Covid-19. \nHe does plenty of 'meet and greets' with fans and will sometimes stop on the way home from training to offer boots or other memorabilia to young fans.\nGarnacho is starting to gravitate towards the older players in the group. Within the squad, he is no longer recognised as a new kid on the block.\nGoing into Sunday's game there are questions around his future, but only time will tell if that lies at Old Trafford or elsewhere.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

I cannot be more proud of the team,\" said the 26-year-old.Van der Poel re-joined the peloton within just 10km of his crash and tussled with Pogacar through the hills. But the Slovenian pulled away with a race-winning attack on the final ascent of the Oude Kwaremont with around 15km to go and cruised along the flat roads to a solo victory.The chasing pack sprinted for the remaining medal positions with Belgian Wout van Aert missing out on a podium finish.",

        "article_text": "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\". \nExperts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.\nRead their answers below.\nSimon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were. \nThe stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.\nIt works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon. \nThe stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.\nGenerally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.\nJack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same. \nSome people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.\nThe other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you. \nThere are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.\nPensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game. \nThe warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.\nA lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.\nThere is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.\nAccording to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats. \nHowever, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment. \nOne of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.\nYet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax. \nThere could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.\nSome think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.\nBut Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods. \nThe UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways. \nAnd while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.\nIt is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.\nChina is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain. \nThere is a feeling that the US was very comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.\nThat is really the unknown question right now, Davison said, but one thing we can expect is more volatility. \nWe got a little bit of a sense of how markets react on Friday when Trump said he had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam. \nThe country has been hit with a 46% tariff by the US, which is quite a significant level, and Vietnam has indicated that it could reduce to zero all its tariffs on US goods going into that country. Stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increase on that news, because these are apparel companies that have a very big presence in Vietnam.\nBroadly, I believe we are going to see markets go down, but you could see particular stocks moving in a more positive direction as there are indications that there may be some exemptions allowed. \nWe do not know what Trump will allow - he has sent some big signals at times saying that his policies will never change, but has also suggested that some deals are possible.",

It's even harder careering along on the American Hills of the 47th US president.\nWhen Trump returned to the White House in January, his direction of travel was clear: he set out to repair relations with Russia. \nThere were Trump/Putin phone calls, high-level US-Russia negotiations. At one point Washington voted with Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the \"aggressor\" in Russia's war against Ukraine.\nWhenever the Trump administration exerted pressure, it was always on Kyiv, never on the Kremlin.\nBut a week or so ago the rollercoaster ride began.\nAfter Vladimir Putin had proposed replacing President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration with \"external governance\" in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN, President Trump made it known that he was \"angry\" with Putin.\n\"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the things that were said over the last day or two having to do with Zelensky,\" Trump commented on 30 March. \"Because when [Putin] considers Zelensky not credible, he's supposed to be making a deal with him. Whether you like him or you don't like him.\"\nAfter a day playing golf with Trump, the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, told the Guardian newspaper: \"I think America, and my sense is also the president of the United States, is running out of patience with Russia.\"\nTrump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of up to 50% on Russian oil exports if Russia was found to be dragging its heels on a Ukraine peace deal. \nA bi-partisan group of US senators has gone even further. \nThey've drawn up a bill that would impose 500% secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil, gas and other resources.\nUp to this point the Russian press had been welcoming the thaw in relations between Moscow and Washington. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper last month ran a headline stating that US and Russian officials had \"started speaking the same language\".\nThis week things changed.\nOn Wednesday, Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper accused the Trump administration of \"administrative insanity\u2026 inexperience\u2026 immaturity\".\nIt criticised the administration's \"bragging and arrogance\" and \"its desire to declare 'huge breakthroughs' when the first steps have barely been taken\".\nThe same day, Komsomolskaya Pravda declared: \"On Ukraine talks, Donald's mood changes as often as the wind.\"\nSigns, perhaps, of a cold wind blowing between Moscow and Washington?\nAnd yet when Trump announced his sweeping tariffs this week, Russia wasn't on the list. \nInstead, US authorities had organised a sanctions waiver for a key Kremlin official: Putin's foreign investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. \nDmitriev flew into Washington for talks with the Trump administration.\nA sign, perhaps, of Russia and America getting on with the business of\u2026 getting along?\nBut on Friday, another warning from Washington to Moscow. This time at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.\n\"President Trump's not going to fall into the trap of endless negotiations about negotiations,\" said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not.\"\n\"If they're not,\" he continued, \"then we'll have to re-evaluate where we stand and what we do moving forward about it.\"\nThis followed criticism of Russia by America's Nato allies. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Putin \"continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet\".\n\"He could accept a ceasefire now, he continues to bombard Ukraine\u2026 We see you, Vladimir Putin, we know what you are doing.\"\nEarlier on Friday there were rumours that Trump and Putin were about to speak again on the phone. These were followed by more rumours: the White House had changed its mind.\nThe Kremlin said that there were no plans for a conversation.\nBut there are reports that American companies are planning to take part in this year's St Petersburg Economic Forum.\nOkay. Stop the ride. I need to get off.\nMy conclusions from all of this.\nTrying to follow each twist and turn on the US-Russia rollercoaster can leave you giddy and confused.\nSometimes it's better observing from a distance. It often helps in order to identify the bigger picture. \nWhich is this: for months Donald Trump's team avoided criticising Putin and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nKey White House officials, like special envoy Steve Witkoff, have repeatedly embraced and repeated Kremlin talking points. True, Washington says it's growing impatient with Russia and has threatened tougher sanctions on Moscow. But it hasn't imposed any. Not yet.\nWill it? \nIs the Trump administration prepared to pressure Moscow into ending the war? And would the Kremlin allow itself to be pressured into doing so? \nIt's a key question as Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.\nThose plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.\nFor some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.\n\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"\nMiller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.\nAs she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.\nMiller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.\n\"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said.\n\"If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.\"\nThese sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks.\nThe automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.\nBut on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.\nOne of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.\nNorth Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.\nThe workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.\nIt was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.\nOutside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.\n\"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.\nAlthough he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement.\n\"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said.\nA couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president.\nBut Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\"\n\"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party.\nThe Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie.\nAnd as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks.\n\"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s. \n\"It seems like the heart of America is gone,\" he said.\nDelta, Louise Gilson added, \"is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons\".\nAnd while these issues have little to do with tariffs, the challenges faced by people in towns like Delta may go some way to explaining why many are willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt, even as markets plunge on faraway Wall Street.",

        "article_text": "Instagram's owner Meta and Pinterest have made significant donations to a charity set up in the name of 14-year-old Molly Russell, the BBC understands.\nMolly, from Harrow in northwest London, took her own life in 2017 after being exposed to a stream of suicide and self-harm content on the two platforms. A coroner concluded the negative effects of online material contributed to her death.\nThe donations are thought to have gone to the Molly Rose Foundation, which campaigns for internet safety. Meta and Pinterest declined to comment.\nMolly's family said they had decided not to take legal action against the tech companies and would \"never accept compensation\" over Molly's death.\nIn a statement via their solicitor, the family said that they would \"pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online\".\nMeta and other social media companies face multiple lawsuits in the US from families who claim their children were harmed by social media. The cases also involve attorneys general from more than 40 states, who claim that the design of the platforms caused harm to children.\nThe first trial is expected to be heard in November.\nDetails of payments to the Molly Rose Foundation have not been publicly disclosed. Rose was Molly's middle name.\nThe charity's annual report states: \"The Molly Rose Foundation has received grants from donors that wish to remain anonymous. Having considered their obligations, the Trustees have agreed to respect these wishes.\"\nThe BBC believes that this refers to the payments to the charity from the two social media companies. These payments started in 2024 and are expected to be paid over a number of years.\nIt's not known exactly when any agreement over donations was reached.\nWithin the last nine months the charity has recruited a CEO, two public policy managers, a head of communications and a fundraising manager.\nAsked about the donations, the charity repeated in a statement that it would \"respect these wishes\" for anonymity.\nIt is understood that no members of the Russell family have received any money from the donation.\nAfter approaching the family's solicitor, a statement was released saying: \"Following the coroner's inquest into Molly's death, we have decided that we will pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online, instead of pursuing legal action. We, Molly's family, have always made clear that we would never accept compensation consequent upon Molly's death.\"\nThe Molly Rose Foundation has become a leading voice in highlighting the dangers of unregulated social media and remains highly critical of Meta.\nIt has called on the government to strengthen the existing Online Safety Act with more robust legislation.\nIt is not calling for a children's social media ban, as planned in Australia, but is demanding that technology companies take more responsibility for the content channelled to young people through social media algorithms.\nIn March this year, in association with publisher Pan Macmillan, the charity sent a copy of a book written by Facebook whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams to every MP in the country. In it Ms Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company's global public policy director, makes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years at Facebook.\nMolly's father Ian Russell is an unpaid trustee of the foundation and remains an outspoken campaigner.\nIn January Mr Russell wrote to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling on the government to act urgently to protect young people online.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or import taxes - for nearly every country in the world could push prices up on almost all the staples Americans routinely buy, from clothes to coffee.\nAfter declaring a national economic emergency on Wednesday, the US president announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of goods of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. They start taking effect on 5 April.\nEconomists have warned the new levies - and those that other countries impose in retaliation - could push prices up for Americans across the board, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that they will increase inflation.\nThat's because the companies importing the goods may pass the costs of the tariffs on to customers or simply bring fewer products into the country, creating a limited supply.\nHere are six everyday items that could become more expensive for American consumers.\nThe \"worst offenders\" about to be hit with the highest tariffs include the clothing manufacturing hubs of Vietnam, China and Bangladesh. The three - among the top five largest apparel importers to the US - could soon see levies ranging from 34% to 46% charged on their products.\nThat means major US department stores like Target and Walmart, where Americans often turn for affordable clothing, and some familiar apparel brands may feel the pressure.\nThe Gap, an American clothing retailer that also operates Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, sources about 21% of its clothing from Vietnam, according to an analysis by Prof Sheng Lu at the University of Delaware's Fashion & Apparel Studies department. Another 37% of its clothing comes from India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\nH&M, known for its inexpensive fashions, manufactures most of its clothing in China and Bangladesh.\nThe tariffs could bring an \"unfair burden to American families, particularly lower-income households\", warned the US Fashion Industry Association in a statement on Wednesday.\nVietnam is open to working out a deal with the administration to avoid the tariffs, Trump has said. China, on the other hand, has retaliated with its own steep levies.\nAlmost all of the coffee consumed in the US comes from outside the country, meaning it could soon become a bigger burden on Americans' wallets.\nThe US mostly sources its coffee from Brazil and Colombia, which are subject to the baseline 10% tariffs. Vietnam is also a key exporter of certain varieties.\nWalter Haas, owner of San Francisco-based coffee roastery Graffeo, told the Washington Post that once tariffs hit, his company will feel it \"immediately\". \nIf they remain in place, those cost increases will be \"permanently baked into the price consumers pay\", he added.\nOther imported foods could similarly rise in price, especially those coming from European Union nations, who will all be hit by a 20% tariff. Prices of shelf staples such as olive oil, which is primarily imported from Italy, Spain and Greece, could rise further.\nShoes and trainers, among the most basic necessities and also one of Americans' biggest splurges, could become more expensive, including the popular Nike Air Force 1 and Adidas Samba trainers. Both sportswear companies rely heavily on Asian factory hubs for their inventories.\nAbout half of Nike and 39% of Adidas trainers are made in Vietnam.\nIn 2024, the US imported more than $27bn of footwear, mostly from China and Vietnam, which was subject to tariffs of about $3bn, according to data by Prof Lu. \nNow, that tax amount could nearly triple.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that, all in all, retailers may not be able to fully swallow the costs, and would need to raise prices by 10% to 12% to offset the levies on Vietnamese manufacturers.\nFrance is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of wine to the US, and its winemakers have expressed anxiety about what the 20% EU tariffs will mean for their business.\nThe Bourgogne Wine Board, which represents producers in the French region of Burgundy, said the US tariffs would deliver \"a serious blow\" to both exporters and American consumers.\n\"The risk with these additional tariffs is that they could push our wines past a psychological price threshold,\" warned Laurent Delaunay, president of the Bourgogne Wine Board - meaning above what buyers feel comfortable paying.\nPrice increases could be seen at restaurants, especially for imported beers or drinks using foreign spirits. Separately, Trump expanded an aluminium tariff to include all canned beer, which could also make it more expensive for those who stay home.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that large alcohol sellers would have to hike prices up to 5% to cover the tariffs if they choose not to absorb the costs themselves.\nCell phones, TVs and video game consoles tend to be big-ticket purchases, and the latest US tariffs could make them even bigger.\nChina, as well as Taiwan and South Korea, are all top exporters of electronics to the US.\nAlmost all iPhones are made in China, although some are also made in India (which, too, is on the \"worst offenders\" list with a 26% tariff). Samsung, meanwhile, has significant production operations in Vietnam.\nIt's still unclear how these major tech companies will respond to the new levies. But Japanese video gaming company Nintendo announced on Friday that it is delaying pre-orders of its Switch 2 console, saying it needs to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\"\nAmericans may soon find that loading up fast-fashion hauls from Chinese online retailers like Temu or Shein with a few swipes on their phones has gotten more expensive.\nAlong with imposing the country-level tariffs, Trump has signed an executive order ending an exemption that prevented charging the levies on small-dollar shipments from China. \nThe exemption is referred to as the \"de minimis\" loophole, and it had allowed shipments under $800 (\u00a3620) to enter the US duty-free. Experts say it was a big reason why Temu and Shein were able to keep their costs low.\nThe order means those companies may have to pay taxes for the first time on the clothes they often send directly to customers.\nIt is unclear just how much costs for these goods could rise with the elimination of the loophole, but the White House says small shipments sent to the US through the international postal network could be subject to a tax of \"either 30% of their value, or $25 per item.\"\nThat tax would then increase to $50 per item after 1 June, according to the White House.",

        "article_text": "Ahead of his upcoming PBS documentary, The American Revolution, acclaimed film-maker Ken Burns tells BBC special correspondent Katty Kay about his unique approach to chronicling US history, from war and conflict to baseball and jazz.\nTitles like Brooklyn Bridge, Prohibition and The Dust Bowl may conjure visions of classroom lessons and by-the-book recitations of facts, but portraying historical events in an approachable \u2013 and enthralling \u2013 way has become US documentarian Ken Burns's trademark. Since the 1980s, he has brought history and culture to audiences in a way that textbooks simply cannot.\nBurns's body of work has earned him two Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards and 15 Emmy wins. At his home in Walpole, New Hampshire, US, the acclaimed documentary-maker tells BBC special correspondent Katty Kay that, like most creatives, he has more ideas than he knows what to do with.\n\"Your head might be filled with 40 or 50 topics, as my head is always filled up, but when one [topic] drops down to your heart, you realise it's firing on all cylinders,\" Burns tells Kay.\nThose topics have ranged from jazz to baseball, and from the granular, such as a chronicle of Leonardo da Vinci's life and work, to the expansive, like 2009's The National Parks: America's Best Idea.\n\"I don't want to tell you stories about what I know,\" he says.\u00a0\"I'd rather share with you a process of discovery. So, I dive into things that I don't know enough about.\" His next area of exploration is the 18th Century: his six-part, 12-hour series, The American Revolution, is due to air on PBS on 16 November. This month marks the 250th anniversary of the start of the American War of Independence, which began in the 13 colonies of British America in 1775, and continued for many years, culminating in the founding of a United States of America.\n\"The American Revolution is one of the most important events in human history,\" Burns told PBS ahead of special screenings for students and teachers across the US. \"We went from being subjects to inventing a new concept, citizens, and set in motion democratic revolutions around the globe.\"\nOn the subject of history, Burns says he does not subscribe to the popular view that it is always doomed to repeat itself, deferring to the opinion of the 19th-Century Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\" was Santanya's comment, in reference to the Holocaust. \"It's [a] lovely phrase you'd wish would be true,\" says Burns. He also points to the famous quote that is attributed to US author Mark Twain: \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it does often rhyme.\"\nBurns doesn't gloss over the uncomfortable parts of US history, pointing out that, for him, being patriotic doesn't mean erasing the past; for instance, the fact that Benjamin Franklin owned slaves. \"He knew it was wrong, and he kept doing it,\" Burns says.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"At the beginning, growing up, I had a kind of idealised version of my country. I love my country. I don't know anyone who loves their country more than me. I make films about the US, but I make films about us.\"\nBurns tells Kay that he believes it can take time for a story's significance to be understood. \"I've been interviewing Obama about his administration, and the longer I wait to do that film, the better it will be, because of the perspective that the passage of time will give,\" Burns says.\nWhen asked about the breadth of his work, which ranges from biographies of single individuals to global events, Burns says that he can be laser-focused on the task at hand. As Burns wraps up The American Revolution and the forthcoming Obama project, he says that he has more than enough material to last beyond \"the 2030s\" \u2013 and, in particular, he has his eyes set on a history of the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\nMore like this:\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 'I was born to be an actor': Twice-knighted Derek Jacobi on nearly 70 years on the stage and screen\n\u2022 Expect to 'age out' of your career, says Vera Wang \u2013\u00a0 she's had at least four\n\"Somebody asked of Duke Ellington, who is certainly our most prolific [composer, with] maybe 22\u2026, 2,300, 2,400 compositions, what the most important one is.

BBC News has asked the White House and the Atlantic for comment.\nWaltz told Fox News last month that another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be in the chat in Goldberg's place and that \"100% I don't know this guy\".\nWhen pressed by host Laura Ingraham on how Goldberg's number was added, Waltz responded: \"Well, if you have somebody else's contact, then somehow it... gets sucked in. It gets sucked in.\"\nGoldberg has previously refuted that explanation, and has said the two have met several times.\n\"This isn't The Matrix. Phone numbers don't just get sucked into other phones.\" Goldberg said during an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press. \"My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone.\"\nBy Goldberg's account, he accepted an out-of-the-blue message request from Waltz that he believed to be a hoax. \nHe watched as, over a period of days, accounts under the names of Vice-President JD Vance, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard exchanged messages about an upcoming US military strike on Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, which ultimately took place on 14 March.\nGoldberg left the chat after the strikes were carried out, but reported his experience in the Atlantic magazine, later publishing the messages in full. The White House acknowledged that the messages were legitimate. \nSources now tell CBS that the first mistakes happened months earlier. \nGoldberg had emailed the then-Trump presidential campaign seeking comment for a story in October 2024. The sources said Hughes was tasked with handling the request, which he messaged to Waltz along with Goldberg's contact information. \nFrom there, Waltz's phone prompted him with the option to save the phone number, which he approved. But the sources said the device saved Goldberg's number under Hughes's name. \nWhen Waltz went to assemble the Signal group chat in March 2025, Waltz believed he was adding Hughes, the sources said. But it was actually Goldberg's number added to the conversation. \nIn the aftermath of the Signal revelations, Waltz took responsibility. \"I built the group,\" Waltz told Fox News, adding it was \"embarrassing\".\nHe said he asked Elon Musk, tech billionaire and Trump ally, for help looking into the error. Separately, lawmakers in Congress demanded an investigation and grilled the chat participants in hearings. Hegseth is also facing a probe from the inspector general of the US Department of Defense over his use of Signal. \nTrump ultimately said he would \"look into\" the issue.\nIt's not clear whether the new reports are the results of those investigations.

        "article_text": "When Rachel Chinouriri played London's O2 Arena last month, she cried.\nThe new wave indie songwriter was there as the support act for Sabrina Carpenter, just a week after her first Brit Awards, where she was nominated for artist of the year.\nSeven years after her debut single, those milestones felt like a validation. \nNo wonder she shed a tear.\n\"A lot of it was stress relief,\" says the 26-year-old, \"but I also felt strangely at home. \n\"I was just like, 'Wow, is this my life'.\"\nChinouriri was booked for the tour after Carpenter fell in love with her song All I Ever Asked and started playing it as her walk-on music in the US.\nWe speak on the 14th date, as she prepares to play Assago, Italy. By this point, she's having a blast \u2013 bounding across the catwalk every night, and dropping to her knees between songs to talk to the audience at eye level.\nBut she admits the first couple of shows were \"slightly rough\".\n\"I filmed Graham Norton for the first time on Friday, then it was the Brit Awards on Saturday. The tour started in Dublin on Monday, and I had to film a music video on my day off.\"\n\"I was having a lot of first time experiences and trying to figure out what I was comfortable with on the road,\" she says.\n\"I'd say from show five, I was starting to enjoy myself.\"\nIf there were nerves, they didn't show.\nThe singer's infectious energy and knotty pop-rock songs have been picking up new fans in every city. One reviewer called her set \"the perfect sweet treat before the main feast\". At the end of March, she surpassed 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify for the first time. Adele sent her a bouquet of roses.\nRachel Chinouriri is officially having a moment - but it hasn't come quickly.\nA former Brit School student, she released her first single, So My Darling, in 2018, and spent the next few years honing her sound. \nThe 2019 EP Mama's Boy was a mellow blend of soulful pop, while 2021's Four\u00b0 In Winter was full of atmospheric electronic soundscapes.\nUnderneath it all, though, Chinouriri was an indie kid. Raised in Croydon by strict Zimbabwean parents, she'd only been allowed to listen to Christian music at home. When they went out, the singer and her siblings would blast out hits by Coldplay, MIA, Lily Allen and Daughter.\nOnce she incorporated those sounds to her music, Chinouriri's career took off. All I Ever Asked \u2013 a chirpy rock anthem that disguises a desperately sad story about being undervalued \u2013 won her support slots with Lewis Capaldi and Louis Tomlinson.\nFlorence Pugh declared herself a fan, and ended up starring in the video for Never Need Me, a killer kiss-off to a boyfriend who left her dangling.\nFor a musician who'd suffered crippling anxiety as a teenager (\"I was pulling my hair out, and having panic attacks\") the success was entirely unexpected.\n\"British culture is quite self-deprecating,\" she says, \"so when I was younger, I just didn't believe I could do these things.\n\"Even the fact I can say I'm a two-time Brit nominee is still quite surreal. Then I'm like, Why is it surreal? \n\"I do deserve it because I've been making music since I was 16, and I haven't stopped'.\"\n\nChinouriri's debut album, the noughties-flavoured What A Devastating Turn Of Events, was finally released last May.\nInitially charting at number 17, it has continued to sell steadily, thanks to the continued popularity of All I Ever Asked on TiKTok, as well as Chinouriri's scene-stealing festival performances.\nReflecting on her rise, she says there is a \"privilege to having a slow-paced career\".\n\"I've seen what happens when you skyrocket or go viral. If I'd a massive hit song when I was 21, I wouldn't have been ready in any way, shape or form \u2013 mentally or professionally. I'd be panicking.\n\"So now that things are skyrocketing, I just need to remember that what I'm good at is writing how I feel and turning those feelings into music.\n\"And even though there's more opinions about what I'm doing now, I need to trust my gut.\"\n\nWhat A Devastating Turn Of Events was a huge emotional purge. Among the topics she discussed: Racism, school bullying, self-harm, alcoholism, alienation and toxic relationships.\nA recurring theme was men who take more from a relationship than they put back in.\n\"I'm quite a caregiver by nature, and that attracts boys who need a lot of help, or are very insecure,\" the singer reflects.\n\"I tend to be the person's 'mother', which isn't fun, because I have to be the strong one and there's no room for my emotions.\"\nBut the days of heartbreak are over. Last year, the singer unexpectedly found herself in a new kind of relationship, one where her needs are as important as her partner's.\nIt's written all over her new EP, Little House. \"Kissing me under the indigo / I begged for the morning sun not to rise / Oh, what a beautiful starry night,\" she sings, totally besotted, on the ballad Indigo.\nThe lead single, Can We Talk About Isaac, even uses her new partner's real name. His photo is on the artwork.\n\"It's quite a brave move,\" she laughs, \"but I'm a hopeless romantic, and I don't want to lose being able to document my life in song.\n\"It's a risk that whoever wants to date me was going to have to take!\"\nThe title track documents their chance meeting at a pub: \"With two pints in his hands, he came over and said, 'Nice to meet you'.\"\n\"He's very sweet, he's got a very simple friendship group, he likes going to the pub \u2013 but he does so much for me. It's the first experience I've ever had of being taken care of.\n\"He's changed my life, no matter what happens between us. We're both just really in love with each other and having a having a blast.\"\nAt the moment, though, the couple have been forced apart. The Sabrina Carpenter tour lasts five weeks, after which Chinouriri sets off for her first headline tour of North America.\nIt comes six months after the singer had to pull out of a US support slot with alt-pop star Remi Wolf. \nShe says the dates would have left her penniless, even with financial support from her record label.\n\"As much as I would have loved that tour, I wouldn't have been able to pay my rent, which was very, very scary,\" she says.\n\"My fans were like, 'Let's help out. Let's do a GoFundMe for 10 grand', but it was far beyond 10 grand. \n\"It was like, who's going to pay for visas, where's your band going to sleep, what are people going to eat? \n\"It was a big wake up call. It made me reassess; do I need to be styled all the time? Do I need to travel this way all the time?\n\"So now, I'm able to go back now in full force and upgrade my venues and sell out almost the entire tour, which is mental.\"\n\nThe cancellation taught her to slow down instead of grabbing every opportunity she's offered. \nIt's a sign that Chinouriri is finally shedding the self-doubt that clouded her early career.\nThe success of the Sabrina Carpenter tour is a prime example.\n\"There's always a risk as an opener, that people might be completely uninterested, but this has been the complete opposite,\" she says.\n\"Having the entire arena sing songs with you is such a blessed feeling to have.\"\nIt won't be long before she's selling out those arenas on her own.",

Conceding three goals in the manner we did is not of the standards of Liverpool. That's clear.\"\nDespite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?\nThey could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.\nThe Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.\nSlot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.\n\"We played a good game on Wednesday [against Everton] and we will show up against West Ham [on Sunday] as well,\" he told Sky Sports.\nLiverpool's 26-match unbeaten run ended by Fulham\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nThis video can not be played\n'Mo will show up' - Slot not worried by Salah's form\nWe've all heard the accusations and whispers this season from rival fans, haven't we?\n'This Liverpool team isn't actually that great.' 'The Premier League is a poor league this season.' 'Liverpool's class of 2024-25 wouldn't have won the title in another season.'\nSunday's loss will only add to those shouts. How fair is this, though?\nFirstly, it has to be said Liverpool's usual rivals are not having their best seasons.\nDefending champions Manchester City are on track for their worst campaign under Pep Guardiola, Manchester United are set for their worst season in Premier League history, Arsenal are nine points adrift of their points tally at this stage of last season, while Tottenham and Chelsea have suffered their own struggles as well.\n\"The other teams just haven't stepped up this season and Liverpool have been consistent all the way through,\" former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports prior to the Fulham match.\n\"The rest of them have fallen well below their standards - Arsenal, obviously Manchester City, United, Tottenham.\"\nIt's been a good season for Liverpool to hit full stride then. And Slot's men have certainly done that.\nEven if Arsenal were on the 71 points they had reached at this stage last season, when they were top of the table, Liverpool would still be two points ahead of them.\n\"I don't even think Liverpool have been outstanding this season, they've been efficient,\" ex-Manchester City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports.\n\"They've been slower in build-up and more ruthless in front of goal.\"\nArsenal's much-lauded invincibles finished their title-winning campaign on 90 points back in 2004. Slot's men need 18 points from seven games to beat that.\nIn 32 Premier League seasons, only 14 sides have reached that mark and one of them - Manchester United in 1993-94 - did so in a 42-game season.\nLiverpool are also the only side to get 90-plus points and not win the title - doing so twice under Jurgen Klopp - meaning only 12 of the previous 31 league-winning sides posted in 90 points or more.\nMeanwhile, the average number of points for the team in second after their 31st game of a season is 65.4 - slightly higher than Arsenal's current 62 points - but there have been second-placed teams on much lower tallies at this stage, including Arsenal's 57 points in 2000-01.\n\"Liverpool want to reinstate the aura that they've had all season and finish strong,\" former Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports.\n\"However they end up winning it is almost up to them. They've been fantastic.\"\nYou can only beat what is front of you and Liverpool have done just that in formidable style - up until Sunday, anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool's 26-match unbeaten run ended by Fulham\nHow to win the Champions League: Liverpool 2019\n13 April: West Ham (H)\n20 April: Leicester (A)\n27 April: Tottenham (H)\n4 May: Chelsea (A)\n11 May: Arsenal (H)\n18 May: Brighton (A)\n25 May: Crystal Palace (H)\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.\nMinisters can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.\n\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.\nSo what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?\nThe PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.\nTrump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.\nThose talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).\nBut as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.\n\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.\nIf a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\"). \nUncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".\nFor weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.\nBut now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.\nOne Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".\nMinisters' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"\nThe government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"\nAnd they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.\nBut just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.\nThis isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?\nThere are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nYou might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.\nYou may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.\nIt is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.\nWhile there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived. \nAs Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.\nThose plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.\nFor some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.\n\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"\nMiller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.\nAs she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.\nMiller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.\n\"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said.\n\"If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.\"\nThese sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks.\nThe automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.\nBut on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.\nOne of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.\nNorth Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.\nThe workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.\nIt was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.\nOutside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.\n\"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.\nAlthough he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement.\n\"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said.\nA couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president.\nBut Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\"\n\"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party.\nThe Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie.\nAnd as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks.\n\"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s. \n\"It seems like the heart of America is gone,\" he said.\nDelta, Louise Gilson added, \"is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons\".\nAnd while these issues have little to do with tariffs, the challenges faced by people in towns like Delta may go some way to explaining why many are willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt, even as markets plunge on faraway Wall Street.",

In fact, if I see a male and they're like 'reset with me', I'm locked in.\n\"I love the fact that it is still predominantly female, but a lot of men are getting into it now as well.\"\nDr Stephanie Alice Baker, an associate professor in sociology at City St George's University of London, said cleaning was a role that women had \"typically\" occupied.\nShe said creating social media content based upon cleaning therefore offered \"a sense of control\".\n\"They can monetise something they'd traditionally have completed as unpaid labour.\"\nDr Baker said that while lifestyle content was increasing in popularity, audience interest was not new.\n\"This type of content existed before social media, it's just that social media makes it a lot more accessible,\" she said.\n\"The mediums and the audiences have changed but the concerns around self-improvement have existed over generations.\"\nDr Ceri Bradshaw, a psychologist at Swansea University, said there was a risk that people could be \"easily tricked\" by snappy, 60-second cleaning videos that in reality take hours of physical work.\n\"I think we're also easily tricked into thinking that we should be more like the people that we watch,\" she added.\nBut Dr Bradshaw said she understood the appeal of watching cleaning content.\n\"With the cleaning, you're effectively sort of fixing something that needs fixing and it's happening very, very quickly.\n\"It's quite soothing to the brain.\"",

This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a \"restrained, even elegant\" film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement, says Steve Pond at The Wrap. \"It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief\u2026 Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore.\"\nReleased on 18 April in the US\nThree of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Muriel, the fianc\u00e9e of an upstanding Korean War veteran, Lee (Will Poulter). He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races. Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the film a \"quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast\", adding: \"On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting.\" On the other hand, the BBC's Caryn James considers it \"a disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film\".\nReleased on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France\nOn a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family \u2013 a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. \"The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,\" says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, \"complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work.\"\nReleased on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland\nRyan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music \"can pierce the veil between life and death\". The town is soon infested with vampires \u2013 but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. \"The film is very genre-fluid,\" Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family.\"\nReleased internationally on 18 April\nFirst dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. \"[Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,\" says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. \"Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.\"\nReleased internationally on 11 April\nWhen Alex Garland was making his last film, Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the \"war is hell\" concept \"to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion\", says Kevin Maher in The Times. \"This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK\nIf you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles \u2013 but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. \"Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,\" says David Hughes in Time Out, \"Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland\nWhat if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. \"It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,\" Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21.\nReleased on 10 April on Prime\nA Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. \"By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things \u2013 a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions \u2013 is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,\" says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. \"There's an 'anything goes' attitude here\u2026 [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore.\"\nReleased internationally on 4 April\nWith a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends \u2013 one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing \u2013 embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine. David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angarano \"graduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director\" with Sacramento. \"Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US\nAng Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. \"An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,\" says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, \"but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves\".\nReleased on 18 April in the US and Canada\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Yoon Suk Yeol, who was officially removed from office on Friday, follows a line of former South Korean leaders who have had their reputations marred or terms interrupted by scandal. \nAmong them are presidents who have faced indictment, exile and imprisonment.\nYoon, who was South Korea's public prosecutor, in fact led a probe that landed former president Park Geun-hye in prison. \nNow apart from being impeached, Yoon is also being investigated for treason over his botched martial law attempt last December. Some analysts believe that, ironically, the move was driven by his fear of prosecution. \nHere is a list of former South Korean presidents whose political careers ended dramatically.\nBefore he became South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee spent some three decades as a pro-independence activist against Japanese rule. \nBut his presidency was polarising. \nWhile some respect him for having laid the foundations for a modern country after World War Two, critics condemn his authoritarian streak. Shortly after his inauguration in 1948, he implemented laws to curtail political dissent; he has also been blamed for the killing of civilians during the Korean War. \nThe opposition rejected Rhee's re-election in 1960 and accused him of rigging the vote. This escalated into violent student-led protests, which saw some demonstrators shot dead by police, and ultimately forced Rhee to resign. \nRhee left the country for Hawaii in May that year, where he died in 1965.\nBorn to a poor rural family in the early years of the Japanese occupation, Park Chung-hee joined the military and was posted to Manchuria (a historical region of north-eastern China) where he served until the Japanese surrendered.\nPark led a coup in 1961 to overthrow Rhee's successor, Chang Myon, and later became president. Park led the country for 18 years through a period of rapid economic development known as the \"miracle on the Han river\". It was during this time that the government opened doors to foreign investment, while also helping to develop now-famous conglomerates like Hyundai, LG and Samsung.\nHowever, he moved towards greater authoritarianism later in his term. In 1972, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and made himself \"president for life\". \nDespite Park's economic achievements, South Korea in the 1970s was rocked by growing protests against his iron-fisted rule, where dissenters were brutally punished.\nPark was assassinated at a dinner party in October 1979 by his own spy chief and lifelong friend Kim Jae-kyu. \nMilitary commander Chun Doo-hwan gained power in 1980 after yet another coup. He presided over a brutal military crackdown in the south-western city of Gwangju, which at the time was the centre of an uprising against martial law in South Korea. More than 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were either killed or disappeared.\nDuring Chun's term, the country saw growth rates hovering around 10% each year. However, he is mostly remembered as a dictator who was unapologetic till the end. \nIn 1983, Chun survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by North Korea forces, who bombed a ceremony he was at during a state visit to Myanmar. The attack killed 21 people and injured dozens more. \nIn 1988, Chun picked his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, also a former general, as his successor. \nThe pair were convicted in 1996 of corruption, as well as their roles in the coup and the Gwangju massacre. Defending the coup while on trial, Chun said he \"would take the same action, if the same situation arose\". \nChun was handed a death sentence - which was later commuted to life imprisonment - while Roh was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Both men were pardoned in 1997 after serving just two years in prison.\nBorn to a poor family, Roh Moo-hyun educated himself and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer without having attended law school. He was appointed a judge in 1977 but later left the bench to become a human rights lawyer, where he advocated for student activists accused of being pro-communist.\nIn 2002, Roh won the presidential election as an underdog, with early polls giving him just 2% of the vote. He tried to shape South Korea as a \"middle power\" among other stakeholders in the region, and championed a so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with trade and aid shipments. \nAfter leaving office in 2007, he returned to his hometown in the south-east and ran a duck farm. However, he took his own life 14 months later, as corruption investigators closed in over allegations he accepted $6m in bribes.\nPublic opinion on Roh improved considerably after his death. Polls by Gallup Korea have consistently ranked him the most beloved president in the country's history.\nFormer Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak entered politics in 1992 and was elected mayor of Seoul a decade later. He won the election by a landslide in 2007, even though a business scandal from his days at the automobile conglomerate resurfaced in the days leading up to the vote.\nLee led the country through the global financial crisis and won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. His term ended in 2013, and he was succeeded by the country's first female president Park Geun-hye, who is the daughter of assassinated former leader Park Chung-hee. \nThe younger Park drew on her father's reputation as the man who pulled South Korea out of poverty. However, a corruption scandal involving a confidante, Choi Soon-sil - the daughter of a Shamanistic cult leader - led to her impeachment in 2016 and arrest a year later.\nFive years after leaving office, Lee too was charged with bribery and later found guilty of creating slush funds of tens of millions of dollars, and taking bribes from various sources, including Samsung. \nPark was handed a 22-year sentence and Lee 15 years, but both have since been pardoned.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has defended sweeping tariffs on imports that sent shockwaves through global stock markets, saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\".\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late on Sunday, he said jobs and investment would return to the US to make it \"wealthy like never before\".\nTrump's top officials stressed that the tariffs - announced last week - would be implemented as planned, playing down recession fears. \nJust hours after Trump's comments, stock markets plunged in Asia early on Monday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping by 7.8%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing more than 12%. \nOn Friday, all three major stock indexes in the US fell more than 5%, while the S&P 500 dropped almost 6% in the worst week for the US stock market since 2020.\nSaudi Arabia's stock exchange - which trades on Sundays - ended nearly 7% lower, its biggest daily loss since the pandemic, state-owned media said.\nUS banking giant JP Morgan has predicted a 60% chance of a US and global recession following Trump's tariffs announcement. \nSpeaking aboard the presidential plane on a flight back to Washington DC, Trump said European and Asian countries were \"dying to make a deal\".\nHe also pushed back against a reporter's inquiry about American consumers' \"pain threshold\" as fears of steep price increases and a market recession grow.\n\"I think your question is so stupid,\" he told the reporter. \"I don't want anything to go down.

        "article_text": "Richard Burton was a global icon - famed for his powerful, baritone voice and passionate yet tumultuous relationship with fellow megastar Elizabeth Taylor.\nBut until now, few had ever heard of Philip Burton.\nPhilip was Richard's school teacher who spotted his potential, became his legal guardian, lent him his name and helped propel him to international stardom.\n\"It was a friendship built for the ages, an unlikely friendship,\" said Ed Talfan, a producer on new biopic Mr Burton, which was released in UK cinemas on Friday.\nThe film tells the story of Richard's difficult early life in Port Talbot, south Wales.\nPhilip, played by Toby Jones, is portrayed as a serious and cultured man who, alongside teaching English, writes and produces plays.\nScrappy young schoolboy Richard, played by Harry Lawtey, has ambitions to become an actor, so Philip teaches him to stand up straight and transforms his speaking voice by getting him to round his vowels, pronounce his consonants and project.\nBut in fact the two men's backgrounds were more similar than their demeanours ever suggested - and his role in Richard's life would prove to be transformative.\nPhilip grew up 30 miles (48km) from Richard in Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf.\n\"Philip had a rather tragic and lonely childhood,\" said historian and Philip's biographer Prof Angela John, who acted as an informal consultant on the film.\n\"His father was killed in a pit accident when Philip was only 14... he wasn't that close to his mother and he'd been very close to his father.\"\nPhilip was an avid reader and theatre lover who won a scholarship to Cardiff University to read Maths when he was only 16. \n\"In a way he forged a whole new persona,\" said Angela.\n\"He had sort of ironed out his Welsh accent because unfortunately in those days, if you wanted to get on and if you wanted to be taken seriously in England... you had to sadly get rid of your accent.\"\nRichard, born Richard Jenkins in 1925, was twenty years Philip's junior.\nHe would have been one of 13 children, but two died in infancy.\nWhen Richard was two years old, his mother died from septicaemia after giving birth to a younger brother. \n\"He was a working-class young man growing up in, I think it's fair to say, abject poverty,\" said Ed.\nRichard ended up living with his sister, her husband who was a miner, and their two young daughters. \n\"The outlook for him was really, really tough. If you're a betting person, you'd have just said, 'well he's going to end up down the mines or at the steelworks',\" he said. \nAngela, who has written Behind the Scenes: The Dramatic Lives of Philip Burton, said Richard's family was \"large\" and \"caring\".\n\"So even though his father had drink problems and there wasn't that much money around, they gave whatever they could,\" she added.\nRichard and Philip's relationship really began after Richard was forced to leave school at 16 to support his family by getting a job.\nPhilip, who had taught Richard at school, decided to step in.\n\"[Philip] was able, as a result of several key figures in Port Talbot... to get Richard back into school, which is a pretty unusual thing to return to school when you've left,\" said Angela. \nWith conditions somewhat cramped at his sister's home, Richard moved into the house of Ma Smith, where Philip was a lodger.\n\"And then from that point Richard was being trained, in effect daily, by Philip,\" said Angela. \nPhilip became Richard's legal ward, taking full responsibility for him, and then Richard Jenkins changed his name to Richard Burton.\n\"That happened for several reasons,\" explained Angela. \n\"It's an awful thing to say these days, but [Richard] would be in a better position to have a name like Burton, which was seen less as a sort of working-class Welsh name.\n\"Also, in effect Philip was taking responsibility for Richard and was already a well-respected person in the theatre world himself, so it gave Richard again a further opportunity.\"\nIn the film, Richard's biological father, played by Steffan Rhodri, is suspicious of Philip's interest in his son, but happy to take a wad of cash in return for signing papers to hand over legal responsibility.\nPrevious biographies have gone further, suggesting Philip's interest in Richard was sexual. \n\"My take is perhaps rather different,\" said Angela.\n\"There is no evidence or proof whatsoever that there was any problem there or that Richard actually found it a problem. \n\"What I will say is that Philip was gay... much later in life when he lived in America he had one known long-term relationship, so I think in some instances this is people putting two and two together and making 25.\"\nEd was in agreement. \n\"The people I've spoken to and the people the team have spoken to who knew Richard and Philip personally, and from the vast majority of biographies, our takeaway is that Philip's motives were good, honest and pure,\" he said. \nPhilip's connections gave Richard his acting break, according to Angela.\nAfter building a reputation in the theatre, Richard made his screen debut in 1949 in The Last Days of Dolwyn.\nHe went on to be regarded by many as the finest actor ever to emerge from Wales, starring in films including Cleopatra and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\nIn 1960 he won a Tony Award for his performance as King Arthur in Camelot on Broadway. He was nominated seven times for an Oscar but never won.\nRichard was married five times, twice consecutively to Elizabeth Taylor.\nMeanwhile Philip went on to work on almost 200 radio programmes, producing work by Dylan Thomas.\nHe reinvented himself in the mid-1950s, moving to the US where he became the first director of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York.  \nRichard and Philip remained close throughout their lives apart from a two-year period when they were not in contact. \n\"Philip wouldn't talk to Richard because he was so loyal to Sybil, Richard's first wife,\" said Angela.  \nShe said it was Elizabeth Taylor who, despite having not met Philip at this point, reunited the pair. \n\"[Richard] was trying to get his head around the Gielgud production of Hamlet and was having some difficulties with it... so [Elizabeth] phoned [Philip] and asked him if he would come to help Richard,\" Angela said.\nShe said Philip and Elizabeth's friendship continued after Richard's death in 1984 from a cerebral haemorrhage.\n\"When Philip was dying, Elizabeth went to visit him in hospital in Florida and the nurse on the ward said she nearly fell over when she saw who the visitor was,\" said Angela.\nPhilip died in 1995, at the age of 90. \nEd believes the story of their relationship will resonate with many.\n\"It's almost a cliche that everybody remembers a great teacher, but it's cliche for a reason because you only need one in your life and it's transformative,\" he said. \nAngela hopes the film will allow Philip to take his own place in history.\n\"It clearly helps to make Philip better known to the world, which I think he does deserve to be,\" she said. \n\"He deserves to be known in his own right because he actually was a remarkable man.\"\nRichard's daughter, Kate, said it was \"very emotional\" being on set and watching the \"extraordinary\" performances of the actors who portrayed her father and grandfather.\n\"Just seeing those two incredible actors play these two very important men in my life... it was the weirdest, strangest thing,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"I thought this is looking really wonderful and very authentic. That was the thing that was making me the most happy.\"\nMr Burton, produced by Severn Screen, BBC Wales and Ffilm Cymru Wales, is in UK cinemas from 4 April 2025.",

        "article_text": "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.\nSo it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.\nNelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.\nInconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.\nIt's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date. \n\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.\n\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\" \nHe believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".\n\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.\n\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"\nThe rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.\nAnd he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.\nHe says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".\nGraham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.\nThis City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.\nThe Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".\nIn a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".\nThe Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"\nBut the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".\nThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".\n\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.\nAnother reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"\n\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.\nFormer engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.\nBeautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).\n\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.\n\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"\nHe says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.\nAs for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.\n\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.\n\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.\nBoth underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.\n\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.\nHe recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".\nThe reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.\n\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"\nHis celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".\nTony Soprano could not have put it better himself.\nThis City Is Ours airs on BBC One on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

This City is Ours: James Nelson-Joyce on the 'Scouse Sopranos'23 hours agoShareSavePaul GlynnEntertainment reporterShareSaveBBCJames Nelson-Joyce stars as the notorious fictional gangster Michael KavanaghIn This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.So it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.Nelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. \"But the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".The star said the \"amazing\" cast and crew \"were like one big family\" on setThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\". \"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.He recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".The reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce. \"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.",

In fact, if I see a male and they're like 'reset with me', I'm locked in.\n\"I love the fact that it is still predominantly female, but a lot of men are getting into it now as well.\"\nDr Stephanie Alice Baker, an associate professor in sociology at City St George's University of London, said cleaning was a role that women had \"typically\" occupied.\nShe said creating social media content based upon cleaning therefore offered \"a sense of control\".\n\"They can monetise something they'd traditionally have completed as unpaid labour.\"\nDr Baker said that while lifestyle content was increasing in popularity, audience interest was not new.\n\"This type of content existed before social media, it's just that social media makes it a lot more accessible,\" she said.\n\"The mediums and the audiences have changed but the concerns around self-improvement have existed over generations.\"\nDr Ceri Bradshaw, a psychologist at Swansea University, said there was a risk that people could be \"easily tricked\" by snappy, 60-second cleaning videos that in reality take hours of physical work.\n\"I think we're also easily tricked into thinking that we should be more like the people that we watch,\" she added.\nBut Dr Bradshaw said she understood the appeal of watching cleaning content.\n\"With the cleaning, you're effectively sort of fixing something that needs fixing and it's happening very, very quickly.\n\"It's quite soothing to the brain.\"",

        "article_text": "Once home to a thriving Jewish majority, Thessaloniki holds fragments of a lost world. One traveller's journey to find them leads to something even more powerful: living memory.\nAs my family admired the gleaming remodel of Thessaloniki's century-old Modiano Market, local culinary guide Smaragda Marki admitted to me that among the trendy cafes and German delicatessen, she wished it were just a little more Greek. \"I wish it were a little more Jewish,\" I responded, staring up at the colourful Easter decorations.\nThe newly reopened market had topped my list of places to go in Greece's second-largest city, bringing together my two favourite things to look for while travelling: good food and tidbits of Jewish history. However, Modiano left me dissatisfied on both counts. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.\nThessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Known as Salonika at the time, it was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. The Ottoman Empire allowed Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th Century to settle there for hundreds of years. But with Ottoman power beginning to wane in the early 20th Century, Greece took over the city in 1912. Five years later, the Great Fire of 1917 devastated huge swaths of the city and left 70,000 people homeless, including much of the Jewish population. The Talmud Torah Synagogue (and 31 others) were destroyed. The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.\nEighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. It wasn't surprising; Thessaloniki's Jewish community now numbers less than 1,000 people, a small population sample within which to find a niche professional tour guide. Plenty of companies offered tours of Jewish Thessaloniki, most touting bonafides by proximity to, rather than being a part of the small congregation.\nEventually, I booked through a company based in Athens because it was run by a Greek Jew. I still didn't know if my actual guides would be Jewish, though at least I could be sure they were trusted by the community.\nWhen Elia Matalon greeted us the next morning, I let out a sigh of relief. In the lobby of our hotel, he explained that he and his wife Hella Kounio-Matalon run their tours together and they both come from families that go back many generations in Thessaloniki's Jewish community. Later in the eight-hour tour he would tell us about how his mother survived the war by hiding in homes across the border in Albania while Kounio-Matalon spoke of her father surviving Auschwitz. We began walking toward a Holocaust memorial sculpture, through a narrow alleyway where he pointed to a restaurant owned by a gentile chef who became fascinated by the city's Jewish history and now serves traditional Sephardic Jewish foods like nogada (meatballs in walnut sauce).\nMuch of the city's history is Jewish history. In the Ano Ladadika neighbourhood, we stared up at the city's famous broken clock, stopped by an earthquake in 1978. The building originally belonged to a bank started by the Italian Jewish Allatini brothers, 19th-Century entrepreneurs whose flour company grew to be the largest in the Balkans before World War Two.\nWe walked down adjacent Siggrou Street and paused in front of a 1926 mansion. Today, it houses a hookah bar, which meant we could wander into the lovely plant-filled atrium and up the grand staircase. Outside, Matalon pointed out the holes in the doorpost where a mezuzah once hung. A visible symbol of Jewish identity, the traditional decorative case holds a prayer, fulfilling the commandment to \"write them on the doorposts of your house\".\nSo much of visiting Jewish history around the world is like this: evidence of where we once were. Visiting the former site of the Jewish cemetery. Peering at painted-over holes and fading stars of David. Jews left their mark on Thessaloniki, but hardly in a fashion that hints to the glorious centre of Jewish life it once was. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.\nAcross the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Because Thessaloniki's laws granted properties owned by Jews before WW2 without surviving family members to the Jewish community, the congregation owns the building, which mostly houses offices, and the synagogue on the ground floor. Marble tablets on the wall list the more than 70 synagogues that served the city's once much-larger Jewish population. The money the rent brings in allows the synagogue to pay retirees to show up to complete their minyan (the minimum number of people needed for a prayer service), a win-win situation.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Mediterranean's ancient gay-friendly civilisation\n\u2022 The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\n\u2022 The tiny, idyllic island where Greeks escape the heat\nOutside the building, I learned how a bench signals that a piece of Thessaloniki's Jewish culture still lives within. The decorative wooden top looks the same as any other bench, a comforting and welcoming place to sit on busy Vasileos Irakleiou, between a synagogue and Modiano Market. Below, a sturdy cement bollard telegraphs its true purpose: these surround all the remaining Jewish sites in the city, protecting them from potential violence by vehicle.\nWe see them again outside the only remaining pre-WW2 synagogue, the community's other house of prayer. The Monastir Synagogue escaped destruction by invading Axis forces because the Red Cross used it during the war, a story that would be slightly more heartwarming if they hadn't nearly destroyed it themselves by using it as a storehouse and stable. It has since been returned to its stained-glass and marble-walled glory.\nA large tour group from a cruise, wearing headsets to hear their guide, filed in, and I browsed the tiny museum in the foyer until they left, just a few minutes later. Then Matalon and Kounio-Matalon announced that they had a surprise for us. Together, they offered to sing a song in Ladino, the ancient version of Judeo-Spanish spoken by the region's Jews: Adio Kerido (Goodbye, Beloved), a love song repurposed as a farewell to Holocaust deportees.\nBy the time they stepped onto the bimah, the raised platform at the front of the sanctuary, I had already seen the history for which I came: the train car parked permanently at the station in memory of the city's Jews, who were deported in similar ones; the mansions built by the thriving majority population of the 19th Century; and the lovely, solemn Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki. But as their voices joined, reverberating in the incredible acoustics of the large room, singing \"Adio, adio, kerido\", I realised I'd found something even better: a unique Jewish culture still alive.\n\"No kero la vida,\" they sang hauntingly, beautifully, mournfully, \"I don't want to live.\" The song offered such sorrow for the departing love, but it brought me such happiness to hear, to see this moment, the kind of moment for which people travel. A moment that could never be predicted, that could never be expected, and, more than anything, that could never happen anywhere else in the world except precisely here.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?\nAndrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.\n\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"\nThe anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.\n\nIn the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.\nThese are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.\nProf Alan White, who founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.\nHe cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"\nHe says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"\nHe says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.\nProf White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without see a health professional.\n\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"\nMachismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.\n\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"\nBut he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.\n\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"\nNHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.\n\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"\nMr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.\nBut he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.\nHe adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.\nDespite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.\n\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.\nEthnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.\nBut none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"\nHe has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.\nMen are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.\n\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"\nSimilar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.\nThe Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.\nProf White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.\nBut he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider. \n\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.\n\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

        "summary": "\"The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.Early deathsIn the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.Prof Alan White, who founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs.

It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.\nBut although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.\nNike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.\nFollow live updates\nSo what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?\nIt depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.\nGoods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.\nHopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.\nBut most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.\nSwiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.\nMeanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.\n\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.\nDavid Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand. \n\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.\nMany other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.\nNike is already facing a tight bottom line. \nIt had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.\nBut that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.\nBy the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.\nThat is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.\nRahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.\nMr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.\n\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.\nAnother option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.\nSimeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".\n\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.\nTheoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"\nEven before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes. \nFinance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.\nAnd Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.\nSentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.\n\nBut ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers.\n\"Nike is very likely to raise prices if the tariff war persists. There is no way for brands to absorb a 30% to 50% increase in sourcing costs.\"\nHe adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"\nChina has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.\nPart of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.\nHowever, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".\nThat includes the time needed to \"consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks\".\nMatt Powers from the Powers Advisory Group says the lack of American textile mills will make it \"difficult and expensive [for Nike] to pivot production back to the US\".\nMr Powers added: \"This transition, if pursued, would take years and require significant investment.\"\nNike did not respond to BBC requests for comment for this article.\nWe also contacted 30 suppliers in Asia but none responded.\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman in New York",

That's the first time that's happened and that's only a few weeks ago,\" he said.\n\"A bad feeling came over me,\" he added, describing Lady Stewart's mind as being in \"a new world\".\nSir Jackie, who lives in Buckinghamshire, described how his wife of more than 60 years had been diagnosed with dementia after she lost control of her small car and it landed on its roof.\nNo-one had been hurt, he said, but the incident had led to an \"awareness that something wasn't right\".\nA decade later, Sir Jackie said the progression of the disease was such that Lady Stewart could no longer walk.\n\"I know that Helen doesn't mean it when she suddenly goes round and hits me, or the [specialist dementia] nurses,\" he said.\n\"She can hit somebody quite often, she uses language that she's never ever said in her life and it comes like that [clicks his fingers] and I say 'darling, darling, don't say that'.\n\"She says 'Why?' And she'll give me a row for doing that. That's usually after 17:00.\"\n'\"Sundowning\" is a common feature of dementia, where the brain tires and a person becomes more agitated later in the day.\nSir Jackie created an accessible home in Switzerland for Lady Stewart without steps or obstacles - and they employ nurses and specialist neurosurgeons.\nHe said he was aware of the privilege his F1 career had afforded him, and that for many families the only option was residential care.\n\"I visit homes for people with dementia and I leave in tears because people are completely lost,\" he said.\nOne in three people will develop dementia in their lifetime, which Sir Jackie describes as a \"disaster\". \nHe said friends and a former secretary had also been diagnosed and understanding the brain was \"bigger than going to the moon\". \nResearch progress had been \"very slow\", with the medical profession \"failing so far\" and diseases like cancer being prioritised, he said.\nHis charity is now funding the development of a new blood test trial to detect signs of frontotemporal dementia 10 to 20 years before it is diagnosed.\nDr Maura Malpetti, senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said the ON-FIRE study was looking at the type of frontotemporal dementia that was not genetic - where diagnoses could not necessarily be predicted.\nDr Malpetti said people with frontotemporal dementia were often misdiagnosed.\n\"It is confused with psychiatric conditions because of the behavioural changes or the language problems,\" she said.\nHer team is looking at how the presence of certain proteins in the blood could indicate the likelihood of future inflammation in the brain.\nChanges in the blood could be present decades before the onset of physical symptoms and they were usually only picked up by scans, which took longer to carry out and required specialist equipment.\nA major problem facing trials for new dementia drugs is that they often involve patients who have already received a diagnosis.\nIt means they are already showing symptoms - but by this time, it may be too late for the drugs to make a difference. \nIdentifying individuals decades before they show symptoms allows researchers to trial drugs to see if they reduce the risk of dementia.\nThree hundred patients were being recruited at 20 centres across England and Dr Malpetti said the trial would eventually be rolled out to 1,000 participants.\nThe study is one of a number of dementia blood tests being developed in the UK, including one at the University of Oxford.\nDr Malpetti said they hoped to see \"tremendous\" developments in the next five years because of the number of inflammation studies.\n\"I think there's been a revelation in the field of blood tests because this allows us to use more accessible and scalable tests,\" she said.\nDr Malpetti said they would freeze the samples so that if a new inflammation marker was discovered, they could go back and test that in the blood.\nShe added an earlier diagnosis would empower families, allowing them to contribute to research to find a cure.\n\"The earlier we understand the changes in the brain, maybe we can stop or slow down the symptoms while the person is still well,\" she said.\nSir Jackie said Formula One brought funding and business acumen to health research.\nThe most recent fundraiser was the One Lap Challenge ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.\n\"When you have a problem in Formula One [clicks his fingers] it's fixed... they're also changing it [technology] all the time, because they have enthusiasm, and they see the results,\" he said.\nDr Malpetti said she hoped charities like Race against Dementia could transform research, helping it to progress faster.\nSir Jackie said he hoped a cure could be found in his lifetime.\n\"I want this to happen just as much as I wanted to be world champion,\" he said. \"It's terribly important.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.\nInconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.\nIt's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date. \n\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.\n\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\" \nHe believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".\n\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.\n\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"\nThe rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.\nAnd he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.\nHe says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".\nGraham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.\nThis City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.\nThe Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".\nIn a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".\nThe Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"\nBut the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".\nThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".\n\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.\nAnother reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"\n\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.\nFormer engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.\nBeautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).\n\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.\n\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"\nHe says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.\nAs for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.\n\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.\n\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.\nBoth underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.\n\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.\nHe recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".\nThe reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.\n\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"\nHis celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".\nTony Soprano could not have put it better himself.\nThis City Is Ours airs on BBC One on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

        "article_text": "Ecosystems which have never been seen before are being accidentally created by humans. They offer a stark look into the nature of tomorrow.\nVenture deep into the forests on O'ahu, Hawaii's third largest island, and you'll find yourself threading through a dense understory of richly scented pepper, cinnamon and guava trees.\u00a0\n\"It's beautiful,\" says Corey Tarwater, an ecologist at the University of Wyoming in the US who began researching O'ahu's ecosystems in 2014. Sounds like the \"cheww-chewww\" song of the pale green warbling white-eye and the chattering, almost electrical call of the red-billed leiothrix surround you. \"There's really neat lizards around,\" adds Tarwater. \"There's these highly structured forests with these amazing tropical plant species.\"\nFor hikers setting out on O'ahu's mountain trails, these are thrilling wildernesses within easy reach of Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, says Tarwater. Yet nothing is quite as it might seem, she adds. \"You wouldn't know unless you study them, but if you walk around any forest around Honolulu, there's not going to be one single native plant species there.\"\u00a0\nO'ahu's lowland forests are now almost entirely devoid of the plants and animals that grew here for millions of years before the arrival of humans. Settlers brought extinctions by cutting down trees to make farms and introducing voracious predators and disease-carrying animals. Today, these tropical forests are a tapestry of non-native species introduced from every corner of the planet: Brazilian peppertree, Indonesian cinnamon and roseleaf bramble from the Himalayas and Australia. Most of the animals, including all the birds that Tarwater mentioned earlier, are also alien.\nO'ahu's mountainous terrain \u2013 a filming location that has evoked heroic, untrammelled wildernesses in the Jurassic Park and King Kong films \u2013 is shaped \"at every level\" by human action, says Jef Vizentin-Bugoni, a Brazilian ecologist at Universidade Federal de Pelota who researched the island's birds with Tarwater. He recalls having his expectations upturned when he arrived on the island in 2017, eager to see Hawaii's famous honeycreepers, a set of brightly coloured native bird species that exist nowhere else in the world. Instead, he was first confronted with an unfamiliar flurry of red and white feathers, which turned out to be a red-whiskered bulbul, a bird whose native range spans from India to Southern China.\u00a0\n\"I followed it as it flitted between trees until it stopped to feed on a fruit I immediately recognised \u2013 guava, a plant native to Brazil,\" he says. \"That moment captured the essence of what's happening in Hawaii: a South American plant being eaten by an Asian bird on a remote Pacific island.\"\nMost of these exotic species arrived in the last century or two and were thrown together more or less at random \u2013 some are escaped pets, others relics from abandoned farms. Yet unlike urban environments where foxes and seagulls scratch together a living eating anything they can find, the forests of O'ahu show signs of structure and organisation.\nBirds that have only lived together for the last century have assumed specialist roles, such as distributing the seeds of native plants, that were once performed by now extinct birds. In a 2019 study, Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni analysed the eating patterns of birds and seed dispersal on the island to see how they compared to a structured and stable native ecosystem that had evolved together over millennia.\u00a0\n\"If I compare what I'm seeing in O'ahu with what I see in the middle of the Amazon, will the interactions have the same organisation?\" asked Vizentin-Bugoni. \"To our surprise, the answer was yes.\"\nFor the last few decades, ecologists have documented the appearance of \"emerging\" or \"novel ecosystems\" like that on O'ahu. Broadly, novel ecosystems can be defined as \"autonomous, wild ecosystems that deviate from natural baselines because of human activities\", explains ecologist Jens-Christian Svenning, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark who studies these ecosystems. Novel ecosystems may contain combinations of species never before seen in history: with some native species living alongside other species introduced by humans beyond their historically recorded ranges or driven into new locations by climate change.\nHumans may also alter the environment itself, creating new habitats by reshaping the landscape or altering environmental chemistry. For example, along the coast of the Netherlands, marine ecologist Laura Govers has documented how a system of coastal defences like dams and sea walls, built during the mid-20th Century, has created a series of salty lakes where exotic species have flourished.\nIn Brazil, rainforests cleared for farming have later become freshwater floodplains, known as v\u00e1rzeas, which are home to a new mix of species. Similarly, retired quarries can fill with water to become deep lakes, and even mines have become valued habitats.\nOne former shale oil mine between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow left a mountain made of stone, says Eric Higgs, professor of ecology at the University of Victoria in Canada. Over at least a century piles of stone formed a novel ecosystem through natural assembly processes, says Higgs. It is now a specially protected area that harbours rare plants such as the early purple orchid and the tiny white flowers of the knotted pearlwort.\nUnlike zoos and botanical gardens, which also contain globe-spanning collages of plants and animals, novel ecosystems like those on O'ahu are not dependent on humans to continually plant and maintain them. They now exist as self-sustaining systems, says Svenning. \"These are wild but changed ecosystems,\" he says. They have passed some critical threshold which means they are unlikely to ever go back to how they were before. \"If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward,\" he says.\nSo how much of the planet is already covered by novel ecosystems like these? Some analyses have arrived at startling figures \u2013 in a 2013 book on novel ecosystems, researchers argued that 30-40% of the world's terrestrial ecosystems have already transformed into novel states. A study by Svenning projected that half of the land on the planet would be novel by 2100.\nHowever, these figures \u2013 like much around \"novel ecosystems\" \u2013 remain highly controversial among ecologists. Critics argue that scientists often cannot clearly define when a threshold of novelty has been passed. There are plenty of cases that are \"kind of borderline\", says Svenning. For example, power plants in Florida and Japan are venting warm water that has created tropical microenvironments with an abundance and variety of species not seen in the surrounding cooler waters.\n\"They don't depend on direct active management,\" like zoos, Svenning says. \"But they still rely on ongoing human activity to be there, right?\"\nFor the last decade, says Vizentin-Bugoni, scientists have studied O'ahu as an \"amazing crystal ball\" that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet if humans continue to damage environments and drive species to extinction.\nFor millions of years, the remote location of the Hawaiian archipelago, some 2,000 miles (3,200km) from its nearest neighbour (the US mainland), made it a petri dish for the emergence of unique species. After the islands first emerged from the ocean as lifeless rocks erupting from volcanoes between 30 million and 500,000 years ago, plants and animals arrived there extremely rarely. Migrating birds were the exception, along with the seeds they deposited in their droppings.\u00a0\nHawaii's plants and the birds that remained there therefore evolved largely in isolation from the rest of the world, leading to the evolution of species found nowhere else on the planet, from \"flightless ibises to bird-hunting owls\", writes anthropologist Todd Braje in his 2024 book\u00a0Understanding Imperiled Earth. Without any mammals or large predators of any kind, unique birds evolved to fill diverse niches, like the moa-nalo, (or \"flightless megaducks\", as Braje calls them) that grew to 2ft (0.6m) in height and helped to disperse large seeds and cycle nutrients on the islands.\nOf the 142 species of bird that evolved to live on Hawaii and nowhere else on the planet, 95 are now extinct, including the moa-nalo, according to the American Bird Conservancy. Similar trends among plants and invertebrates have earned it the label of the \"extinction capital of the world\".\nHawaii's islands are a \"microcosm\" of the issues countries worldwide face from exotic species, according to 2020 research led by Liba Pejchar, a conservation scientist at the University of Colorado. The arrival of humans \u2013 first small groups of Polynesian sailors around 1,000 years ago, later Europeans in 1778 \u2013 resulted in forest clearances and the introduction of rats, dogs and cows. For birds, the greatest threat today is the mosquito, which since the 1800s has spread avian malaria that can kill native birds with a single bite.\n\"We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands,\" says Tarwater. \"It's what you don't want to have happen.\"\nUnsurprisingly, when Tarwater began meticulously tagging Hawaiian birds, non-native species had a bad rap. \"When we first started working out on O'ahu, we were asked by people why we didn't just shoot the [non-native] birds,\" says Tarwater. But by instead observing them, her and Vizentin-Bugoni's team discovered that several of the last native fruiting plants, such as the violet berried uki'uki which clings on in pockets high up the mountains, are wholly dependent on non-native birds to disperse seeds.\n\"It was shocking to us that they were just so embedded into these systems,\" says Tarwater. Still, it's a \"double-edged sword\", she says. \"Unfortunately, they also disperse our non-native plants,\" she says \u2013 which can, in turn, crowd out the endangered natives.\nDuring a decade investigating the rich networks that have self-assembled here, both Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni have been amazed to find the extent to which ecosystems have meshed together. In a 2020 paper, Tarwater showed that the traits and bodies of non-native birds have shifted in areas they have invaded \u2013 some, for example, have smaller bills, better for eating O'ahu's smaller fruits. On O'ahu you can now watch mysterious flocks of numerous species take off together in search of fruit. This behaviour is also seen in the Amazon, but in O'ahu the flocks are made up of birds from all around the planet, from the Himalayas to South America.\nFor the profoundly and irreversibly changed environments we see in O'ahu, the most intuitive name might have come not from a scientist at all but from Higgs' young daughter: she has dubbed them \"freakosystems\", he says. Since these strange places began to gain recognition in the late 1990s, the biggest question has been what environmentalists should do about them.\nInvasive species\nDeliberately and accidentally, humans have introduced countless species of animals, plants and other organisms to non-native biomes. While most new additions are innocuous, more than 37,000 species have been found to harm native species, habitats and ecosystems, causing them to be labelled invasive, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).\nGlobally, invasive non-native species are one of the top five drivers of global biodiversity loss, according to IPBES, contributing to 60% of global extinctions and causing damages worth $423bn (\u00a3323bn) per year.\nRestoration ecologists have been on the frontlines of answering this question, says Higgs. Traditionally, these scientists have aimed to recover degraded landscapes towards some reference point \u2013 often, in the Americas, this was set about the time that European colonies began arising in the Americas. The idea was to restore ecosystems to a pre-disturbance or pre-human state.\nBut in many places \u2013 including islands like Hawaii and New Zealand, where so many species of plants and animals have gone extinct and non-native species have spread so far \u2013 turning back the clock was clearly impossible. This idea of \"practical unrestorability\" became the hallmark of what a novel ecosystem is, says Higgs.\u00a0\nFaced with these challenges, ecologists began to question how useful it would be to follow traditional conservation strategies, such as eradicating non-native \"invasive\" species \u2013 typically defined as an introduced species that harms its new environment. But it is not always easy, in much-changed environments, to identify which species these are.\nTake, for example, the packs of feral donkeys or \"burros\" that roam the American South and Australia, the descendants of working animals once used widely in mines and mills that were turned loose decades ago. In places where feral donkeys and horses have competed with native herbivores and overgrazed plants, some local governments have resorted to large-scale culls.\nBut research has shown that donkeys also dig water holes \u2013 known as wells or \"ass holes\" \u2013 in many cases providing the only water source in drylands where temperatures can reach almost 50C (122F). In the Sonoran Desert, which spans the US and Northern Mexico, these holes support more than 50 other species, including birds and large native mammals such as mule deer. Mountain lions have even been observed eating donkeys.\u00a0\nMeanwhile in Australia, introduced megafauna \u2013 from feral horses and donkeys to camels and water buffalo \u2013 often make drylands more functionally similar to the ancient past, when 200kg (440lb) giant wombats dug holes in the country's interior, Svenning's research has shown.\nYet for nature lovers brought up to value pristine environments, and having long ago learned of the destruction wrought by invasive black rats or cane toads, novel ecosystems challenge many of the fundamental values that have driven conservation for decades. In 2011, when the writer Emma Marris published the influential book Rambunctious Garden, which explored novel ecosystems, critics responded that she was giving permission to \"trash nature\". Like Marris, many urban communities have come to love novel environments that have arisen in their local neighbourhoods. Mount Sutro, for example, a forest of non-native eucalyptus, has become a much-loved park in San Francisco, says Higgs.\nAs climate change and nature-loss continue, ecologists are adapting their language to acknowledge that many ecosystems have \"novel elements\" or degrees of \"ecological novelty\". A new map published by researchers in March 2025, tracked how ecosystems across the planet were being changed by climate change, the loss of key animals and native plants being replaced by invasive species. Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning's lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth's land highly changed: \"This extended out to protected areas,\" he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.\nResponding to these findings, ecologist Anna Walentowitz at the University of Bayreuth in Germany wrote that ecological novelty is now the \"new normal\" for our planet, forcing us to question how we protect nature today.\nO'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni. Research has spotlighted certain species that set alarm bells ringing, as they are most likely to do harm to surrounding ecosystems.\n\"For the plants, the ones that are most likely to be a problem are the ones that fruit for a long period and also have small seeds,\" he says. Both these characteristics increase the chance of being eaten by birds and spread around rapidly.\nOn O'ahu itself, research into novel ecosystems is guiding more unconventional conservation strategies. Most land managers are aiming to safeguard the 87% of native plants threatened with extinction by meticulously removing invasive plant species from \"these tiny restoration sites\", explains Tarwater. Although this allows native plants to grow without competition, these denuded areas quickly become bird-free zones, she says. \"There's not enough fruit in those areas to attract them there, which isn't good [for native plants], if those are the only things left to disperse their fruits.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The ancient forest that supports Venice\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\n\u2022\u00a0The race to protect Pacific whales\nTo get the birds to spread native plants around, the team in O'ahu instead try to trick them. They use speakers to play the calls of \"birds that we know are really good seed dispersers\" to lure them to restoration sites where native plants remained, Tarwater says. \"Once they're there, they're like: 'Oh, hey, look at that fruit!' and they'll eat it.\" (Read about how scientists coax back species with sound in other parts of the world too.)\nSuch strategies work with non-native birds to help conserve the tiny patches of remaining native plants \u2013 although many roles, such as the moa-nalos' dispersal of large seeds, are still not filled, as no non-native species are big enough.\nIt all makes unravelling what to do with these novel habitats difficult. \"It's complex and depends on the goals of restoration,\" says Tarwater. A conservationist focusing on native plants may eradicate as many non-native competitors as possible, she says. \"But if you're interested in conserving a native snail or some of these other species, that [non-native plant] might be the habitat that they currently rely upon.\"\nWhile novel ecosystems remain controversial, on O'ahu, conservationists and land managers have become less black-and-white about native and non-native species, says Tarwater.\n\"We know that the challenges of the novel ecosystems are going to remain, and likely increase. We know that it's not as simple as them being good or bad.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "\"While novel ecosystems remain controversial, on O'ahu, conservationists and land managers have become less black-and-white about native and non-native species, says Tarwater. Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning's lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth's land highly changed: \"This extended out to protected areas,\" he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.Responding to these findings, ecologist Anna Walentowitz at the University of Bayreuth in Germany wrote that ecological novelty is now the \"new normal\" for our planet, forcing us to question how we protect nature today.Discovering what worksO'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni. The idea was to restore ecosystems to a pre-disturbance or pre-human state.But in many places \u2013 including islands like Hawaii and New Zealand, where so many species of plants and animals have gone extinct and non-native species have spread so far \u2013 turning back the clock was clearly impossible. A study by Svenning projected that half of the land on the planet would be novel by 2100.Jef Vizentin-BugoniResearchers studying O'ahu's unusual ecosystem during fieldwork on a site in Kahanahaiki (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)However, these figures \u2013 like much around \"novel ecosystems\" \u2013 remain highly controversial among ecologists.

But you can't do that if it's going to London and various other theatres around the country,\" he says. \nTachia Newall, who plays Napoleon, says one thing that makes the production so special is the incorporation of British Sign Language (BSL) and live audio descriptions.\n\"It's just a beautiful idea to let everybody in,\" Tachia says.\nBrydie, who is physically disabled, adds: \"I don't think I've ever been in such a space where disabled and deaf and hard-of-hearing performers weren't an afterthought.\n\"I don't think I've ever been in such a collaborative rehearsal space.\"\nDespite the dark nature of the play, the cast said they had a lot of fun performing. \n\"In rehearsals, we all kind of cottoned on that, even though the subject matter was so dark and could be related to so many things happening around the world, we were just having a lot of fun doing it,\" Tachia says.\nDirector Amy adds: \"This team is so incredible and they're such a well-bonded group of humans. \n\"We've had such a lovely time making this challenging and epic show.\"\nAnnouncing the nominations, the Olivier Awards said: \"The competition for nominations has been intense in what has proven to be a transformative year, marked by a rich blend of dynamic new works, innovative interpretations of classics and a commitment to championing diverse voices and stories.\"\nThe annual awards will be hosted by singer and West End star Beverley Knight and Broadway performer Billy Porter. \nThe ceremony will take place at the Royal Albert Hall at 17:45 BST on Sunday. \nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

Since the 1980s, he has brought history and culture to audiences in a way that textbooks simply cannot.\nBurns's body of work has earned him two Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards and 15 Emmy wins. At his home in Walpole, New Hampshire, US, the acclaimed documentary-maker tells BBC special correspondent Katty Kay that, like most creatives, he has more ideas than he knows what to do with.\n\"Your head might be filled with 40 or 50 topics, as my head is always filled up, but when one [topic] drops down to your heart, you realise it's firing on all cylinders,\" Burns tells Kay.\nThose topics have ranged from jazz to baseball, and from the granular, such as a chronicle of Leonardo da Vinci's life and work, to the expansive, like 2009's The National Parks: America's Best Idea.\n\"I don't want to tell you stories about what I know,\" he says.\u00a0\"I'd rather share with you a process of discovery. So, I dive into things that I don't know enough about.\" His next area of exploration is the 18th Century: his six-part, 12-hour series, The American Revolution, is due to air on PBS on 16 November. This month marks the 250th anniversary of the start of the American War of Independence, which began in the 13 colonies of British America in 1775, and continued for many years, culminating in the founding of a United States of America.\n\"The American Revolution is one of the most important events in human history,\" Burns told PBS ahead of special screenings for students and teachers across the US. \"We went from being subjects to inventing a new concept, citizens, and set in motion democratic revolutions around the globe.\"\nOn the subject of history, Burns says he does not subscribe to the popular view that it is always doomed to repeat itself, deferring to the opinion of the 19th-Century Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\" was Santanya's comment, in reference to the Holocaust. \"It's [a] lovely phrase you'd wish would be true,\" says Burns. He also points to the famous quote that is attributed to US author Mark Twain: \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it does often rhyme.\"\nBurns doesn't gloss over the uncomfortable parts of US history, pointing out that, for him, being patriotic doesn't mean erasing the past; for instance, the fact that Benjamin Franklin owned slaves. \"He knew it was wrong, and he kept doing it,\" Burns says.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"At the beginning, growing up, I had a kind of idealised version of my country. I love my country. I don't know anyone who loves their country more than me. I make films about the US, but I make films about us.\"\nBurns tells Kay that he believes it can take time for a story's significance to be understood. \"I've been interviewing Obama about his administration, and the longer I wait to do that film, the better it will be, because of the perspective that the passage of time will give,\" Burns says.\nWhen asked about the breadth of his work, which ranges from biographies of single individuals to global events, Burns says that he can be laser-focused on the task at hand. As Burns wraps up The American Revolution and the forthcoming Obama project, he says that he has more than enough material to last beyond \"the 2030s\" \u2013 and, in particular, he has his eyes set on a history of the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\nMore like this:\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 'I was born to be an actor': Twice-knighted Derek Jacobi on nearly 70 years on the stage and screen\n\u2022 Expect to 'age out' of your career, says Vera Wang \u2013\u00a0 she's had at least four\n\"Somebody asked of Duke Ellington, who is certainly our most prolific [composer, with] maybe 22\u2026, 2,300, 2,400 compositions, what the most important one is.

        "article_text": "The last time there was no Manchester club in the Premier League's top two was 2016-17, and it has only happened four times since City were promoted in 2002\n\"Not so much red or blue - grey would be better.\"\nThe overwhelming feeling around the 196th Manchester derby was neatly summed up by a comment posted on the BBC Sport website.\nIt might be a stretch to claim, as one respondent did, it was 'the worst derby match in the world'. But the sentiment encapsulated the mood.\n\"It's a Manchester derby,\" seethed former United captain Gary Neville on Sky Sports after the dull goalless draw at Old Trafford. \"It should have more blood, thunder, risk, and courage involved in playing the game.\n\"The congratulations and love-in I'm watching says both teams are happy with 0-0. It looks like it's Sunday afternoon and they're going to go for a roast dinner together now.\"\nUnited head coach Ruben Amorim has not been in England long but the former Sporting boss has worked a few things out.\n\"I understand everything,\" he said. \"Gary Neville is critical about everything. I understand that part.\"\nAmorim's assessment was a simple one. How could anyone expect a reprise of the great games of the past, from either the red or blue sides of the great Mancunian divide, given where the two teams are at the moment?\nCity remain outside the top four, which would guarantee qualification for the Champions League next season. \nMore pertinently, while they remain fifth - which will almost certainly secure a spot in Europe's elite competition - they will drop down if Newcastle win either of their two matches in hand, starting with Monday's home match against nearly doomed Leicester.\n\"I understand we are, in the moment, doing the worst season in history,\" said Amorim. \"Manchester City won everything in the past but this season are struggling.\n\"We are not in the best moments to give the best spectacle to every fan. When we are not fighting for the big things, of course it's different.\n\"You have to look at the context of the game. I understand the critical aspect of players that played in this game in a different way, because they were fighting for the titles every time.\"\nUnsurprisingly, another outspoken former United captain wasn't having any of that.\n\"They get interviewed as if a draw isn't too bad,\" Roy Keane said. \"A draw doesn't get you anywhere fast. It isn't good enough.\n\"Forget the top teams. I'm on about competing with Brentford and Crystal Palace and Wolves and all these teams. Are you telling me Man Utd should be behind them, even with this group of players?\"\nFor context, United - on course for their worst-ever Premier League season - are six points ahead of Wolves. Brentford, one place above them in 12th, are four points ahead.\nThere were also post-match chants against the Glazer family from home fans who stayed behind, determined to crank up pressure on the American majority owners, who they blame for United's parlous state.\nBut Amorim and City boss Pep Guardiola have to set aside the noise to deliver significant improvement.\n\"You see the numbers of players who have been at the top for four, five, six years,\" said Guardiola. \"This year, we drop. It's not one, it's all of them - that's why we are struggling to win games.\"\nMan Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes had a different take on the lack of intensity.\n\"It can't be like it was in the past, a lot of things have changed, with VAR, everything,\" he said. \"With VAR, you can't do that. We can't be as rough as we want in the duels. Everything has changed.\"\n\"That was one of the dullest Manchester derbies I've seen,\" Chris Sutton told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It tells you where the clubs are at. Both have a lot of work to do in the summer.\"\nMan City miss chance to move into top four with dull derby draw\nFans 'should be ashamed' of Foden chants - Guardiola\nNo wins for top five - how race for Europe stands\nUnited's problems are huge.\nIt is difficult to imagine Amorim choosing many of the players available to him in an ideal squad.\nBut the fundamental point is a lack of goal threat. United have failed to score in 11 of their 31 Premier League games this season. Aside from matches against the three teams destined to go down, they have scored two goals or more on six occasions, including when they lost at home to Nottingham Forest on 7 December.\n\"We had the same lack of goal [threat],\" said Amorim, when asked about comparisons to last Tuesday's defeat by Forest at the City Ground.\nUnited need to be significantly better at recruitment in the summer than they have been on the pitch this term.\nWing-backs, central defenders and central midfield are all areas of weakness, let alone up front, where Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee continue to toil for little reward. It is now a combined four goals in 48 appearances for the pair since the Europa League win over Viktoria Plzen on 12 December, when Hojlund scored twice.\nOn Sunday, Amorim talked about how he thinks things are going on the good days. That implied there have been other days when he has wondered if United are heading in the right direction.\n\"In the moment it's still really hard every day, but of course you can imagine that the next season is going to be so much different,\" he said. \"That's why I'm always saying I'm in a rush. Everybody here is suffering a lot with all these changes. We have to show something in the next year, right away.\n\"In the good days you think like that, that it was important to come [here] in the middle of the season, to work with the players, to improve the players as soon as possible, to start the next season with the better idea of what we want.\"\nFor City, the journey to the preferred destination is far easier to navigate and there is more belief in Guardiola to keep everyone on the right path.\nYet, for them too there are hazards, not least in the unknowns. \nBy his own admission, he kept faith in too many of his long-serving players last summer. That will not happen again. \nWe already know Kevin de Bruyne is leaving but there are questions over plenty of others in his squad, not all of them fringe, injured or unwanted players. \nThe futures of Jack Grealish, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, all involved against United, have to be determined. \nJuventus full-back Andrea Cambiaso and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz are mentioned most frequently as likely additions to Guardiola's squad - but there will probably be more than two new faces.\nClearly, who they can sign will be impacted by the outcome of the hearing into the 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches. Guardiola cannot control that situation. \nCity's status and the pull of the manager will ensure they remain an attractive proposition even if they fail to qualify for next season's Champions League. \nHowever, it would be a blow to his pride if, for the first time in his senior managerial career, he fails to take a team into the elite club competition. Not that he is thinking so far ahead. \n\"Eight games, Crystal Palace [next], go for it,\" he said. \"I'd prefer to have 10 or 12 more points but it is what it is. I'm not concerned about next season right now, I'm just concerned about recovery.\n\"Crystal Palace, Everton, Aston Villa and the FA Cup semi-final [against Nottingham Forest].\"\nLooking ahead for red and blue is appropriate in Manchester just now. It's the easiest way of banishing the memory of what happened (or didn't) at Old Trafford.\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nPremier League index\nPremier League table\nPremier League fixtures\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you",

        "article_text": "Kevin de Bruyne has won six Premier League titles with Manchester City\nKevin de Bruyne has announced he will leave Manchester City after 10 years when his contract expires at the end of the season.\nDe Bruyne, who turns 34 in June, has won 16 trophies since joining City from Wolfsburg in 2015, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.\nThe Belgium international has been labelled \"one of the greatest midfielders to ever play in this country\" by his manager Pep Guardiola. \nBut his announcement on Friday does raise several questions, which BBC Sport attempts to address. \n'One of the greatest' - De Bruyne to leave Man City\nWorld Football Podcast - Muller & De Bruyne: Leaving legends' legacies\nMatch of the Day Top 10: Premier League midfielders\nIt came from Pep Guardiola and technical director Txiki Begiristain.\nWhen he talks about contracts, Guardiola usually says it is a 'club' decision and passes on responsibility to those above him. On this occasion, he is owning it.\n\"It was not easy for me to tell him it won't continue,\" Guardiola told the media at his scheduled pre-match news conference before Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\nThat statement reinforces De Bruyne's own words in his social media post: \"Whether we like it or not, it's time to say goodbye.\"\nWhat is not absolutely clear is what the key factors were in the decision to sever ties.\nDe Bruyne is one of the Premier League's highest earners. It was impossible to imagine City would offer an extension on the same \u00a3400,000-a-week terms. They are also pretty good at playing hardball, as former captain Ilkay Gundogan found out in 2023 when City refused to buckle over the Germany midfielder's demands for a two-year deal.\nDe Bruyne has been a shadow of his usual self this season. By common consent, he has not had a game-changing influence since the victory at Newcastle in January 2024, when he came off the bench to score one and create another, turning a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 victory.\nHis four goals and seven assists in all competitions this season is down on normal levels. He last scored against Championship side Plymouth in the FA Cup last month. The last two of his six Premier League assists came in a 6-0 win against relegation-threatened Ipswich in January.\nGuardiola has admitted this season he was probably wrong to remain loyal to his core squad last summer. Was that the deciding factor, or was it deemed demeaning to offer De Bruyne an extension on far less than he is earning now?\nPep Guardiola says De Bruyne is \"one of the greatest midfielders to ever play in this country\"\nDe Bruyne's representatives have previously spoken with clubs from the Saudi Pro League, so contact in that direction is established.\nThere was also concrete interest from Major League Soccer's 2025 expansion club San Diego FC before the new season.\nSan Diego did hold discovery rights on De Bruyne, meaning no other club could negotiate with him.\nHowever, sources with an understanding of the situation says that has now been dropped and San Diego have no plans to return to the potential signing.\nIt cannot entirely be discounted he may move to another, less taxing, European league.\nDe Bruyne spoke at length about his situation in November, before the Champions League draw with Feyenoord.\n\"I can make a difference for this team,\" he said. \"And as long as I feel that, that's a good indicator I can still play at the top level. So that's the only assurance that I need.\"\nIn June 2024, De Bruyne said he was 'open' to moving to Saudi Arabia.\nHowever, he has three children, all under 10 - with eldest son Mason a player of promise - and it is not clear if he views Saudi Arabia as the right move at this stage in their lives. \nA week ago Guardiola admitted it had been a \"poor\" season and he had done a \"bad\" job.\n\"We don't deserve a bonus, not even a watch,\" he said before the FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.\nCity have already started to address the situation. In the winter transfer window, they spent a near-record \u00a3180m on four new players. And, with no Profit and Sustainability issues to hamper them because of the number of players sold for significant fees in recent years, further signings are certain this summer, with Bayer Leverkusen's Germany international Florian Wirtz high on the list of targets.\nBut there will be sales too. It is difficult to see Kyle Walker returning to City once his loan spell with AC Milan ends. Like De Bruyne, Gundogan's contract expires in June and while there is an option to extend by a year, it is not certain the clause will be activated.\nThere has been huge speculation about the future of Jack Grealish, who admitted this week he has been frustrated at his lack of Premier League starts. After being overlooked by Gareth Southgate for Euro 2024, Grealish will want to give himself the best chance of making it to the 2026 World Cup.\nGuardiola has spoken about the injury issues that have blighted John Stones and Nathan Ake this term, while it cannot be taken for granted that Bernardo Silva, Ederson or Matheus Nunes will still be at City when the summer window closes on 31 August.\nKalvin Phillips' time at the club should come to an end whether he returns from Ipswich or not. When the futures of James McAtee and Nico O'Reilly are taken into account, a dozen first-team squad members head into the summer with questions over them.\nIt is likely to be City's busiest summer of transfer activity since Guardiola arrived in 2016.\nDe Bruyne helped Manchester City to a first Champions League triumph in 2023\nThis is surely one of the easier elements of De Bruyne's exit to read. The Belgian's contract runs to 30 June. That means he is clear to play in the group phase of the expanded 32-team tournament in the United States. If City win their group, he could also play in the last-16 game.\nHowever, \"could\" is doing some heavy lifting here. To play any further part in the knockout phase, De Bruyne would have to sign a short-term extension, which Fifa has made possible under adjustments to their registration rules made specifically for the tournament.\nBut, if De Bruyne is intent on extending his career - and every indication so far is that is the case - why would he risk injury playing at a tournament which Guardiola has indicated he intends to use partly as preparation for the 2025-26 campaign? That would make little sense.\nShould he so wish, De Bruyne could sign a lucrative contract at one of the other 31 clubs purely to play in the tournament, and then leave when it is done, which is another avenue Fifa's amended rules have been created to allow.\nFar more likely, De Bruyne will play for Belgium in their World Cup qualifiers with North Macedonia and Wales at the beginning of June and then take a break before starting the next phase of his career somewhere else in July.\nThat would mean an Etihad Stadium send off in City's final home game against Bournemouth - scheduled for 18 May, but to be moved if Guardiola's side are in the FA Cup final that weekend.\nAs prestigious as Fifa president Gianni Infantino says the Club World Cup is, that would surely be a more fitting City farewell for De Bruyne - at least until he returns for the unveiling of the statue Guardiola believes is certain to be commissioned in his honour.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",
