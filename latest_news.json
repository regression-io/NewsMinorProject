We get one slightly in our favour and there's national headlines for a week.\"\nHe was seemingly referring to a decision in Bergvall's favour against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg, when the midfielder avoided a second yellow card.\n\"Things go against us and there's not even a sentence on it,\" Postecoglou added.\nPostecoglou brought off the struggling Yves Bissouma and Brennan Johnson at half-time against Fulham and sent on Bergvall and Son Heung-min.\nThe Spurs boss confirmed Bissouma was taken off due to his poor performance, saying: \"I just feel Biss can sometimes let the game drift by him.\n\"He needs to be a little bit more dominant in the way he gets on the ball. At times I think the game gets away from him and today we needed more in that position.\n\"I needed him to play though, because he hasn't played a lot. At the same time you've got to perform. It's fair to say, Biss and a few others are probably lacking a bit of confidence.\n\"That's affecting him, but we're at the point of the season now where we need guys to get out there and put those things to one side and perform.\"\nPostecoglou added: \"It's not about getting through to him or a lack of effort.\n\"I just think with players sometimes they go through these spells and he needs to find a way to break through that and we need to find a way to get that out of him.\"\nIt is becoming implausible for 13th-placed Spurs to qualify for Europe through the Premier League after taking just 10 points from their past 10 games.\nHowever, Spurs would qualify for the Champions League if they were to win the Europa League, and they moved a step nearer that goal by knocking out AZ Alkmaar on Thursday to reach the quarter-finals.\nPostecoglou, who has faced heavy criticism for this season's domestic failings, is clear that Spurs must not throw away their last remaining nine Premier League matches.\n\"I said to the players I'm not going to allow anyone to think about Europa and nothing else,\" he said.\n\"We can't let this league season go the way it has.

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

        "article_text": "In 2019, climate scientist Steffen Olsen took a startling photo of huskies appearing to walk on water. The photo quickly went viral as it revealed the reality of Greenland's rapidly melting ice.\nIn June 2019, a striking image of husky dogs apparently walking on water in Greenland stunned the world and quickly went viral.\nThe photo was taken by Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute and lead of Blue Action, a European project which investigates the effect of a changing Arctic on weather and climate.\n\"The reaction surprised me,\" says Olsen. \"It surprised me that so many people saw this as a beautiful photo. I saw it as a scary situation.\"\nThat's because the dogs were in fact wading through ankle-deep meltwater on top of sea ice in Inglefield Bredning, an 80km-long (49.7 miles) system in northwestern Greenland.\n\"I learned to see the photo as an illusion. People don't see sea ice, but dogs walking on water,\" Olsen says.\u00a0\nOlsen captured the photo while travelling with a team of scientists who were monitoring sea and ice conditions near the town of Qaanaaq, one of the world's most northerly towns. They were retrieving scientific instruments they had deployed during the winter.\u00a0\n\"We had been travelling for some hours and it became clear that the melting was very extreme\u2026 [the ice] more or less melted beneath our feet while we were travelling on it,\" says Olsen. \"The local hunters and I were very surprised\u2026 we were searching for dry spots to get the dogs and the sleds out of the water and there were none in sight. We turned around and made it back to the coast.\"\nThe dogs are typically very hesitant to get their paws wet, says Olsen. \"Usually when we meet water, it's because there are cracks in the sea ice and the dogs have to jump over the water\u2026they hate it. But it was actually very warm so I think they were happy to have cold feet,\" he says, adding that temperatures reached 14C (57F) on the day.\nThe scientists managed to retrieve their instruments a few days later once the water had drained away through small cracks in the ice sheet. \"Then you have a short period of time when you can then travel again before the ice collapses and breaks up,\" says Olsen.\nOlsen says he was extremely surprised by the rapid melting he witnessed when he took the photo on 13 June 2019. He has only experienced such an extreme event once during his 15 years carrying out research in Greenland. It's unusual for melting to occur that quickly, Olsen explains.\n\"It requires a sudden onset of warm air while you still have fresh snow on the ice and solid sea ice. So it's an example of an extreme event developing early in the season... The local community have told me: 'you will have to wait 100 years to see [such an event] again'.\"\u00a0\nMelting events such as the one Olsen witnessed would normally not occur until later in the season, in late June and July, but in 2019 melting started in mid-April, around six to eight weeks before the 1981-2020 average, and affected roughly 95% of Greenland's ice sheet, according to the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSuch early melting events can have a \"snowball effect\" and lead to more melting as there is less snow and ice to reflect the Sun's rays back into space and keep the surface cool, explains Bianca Perren, a paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who studies sediment cores from polar regions to understand the long-term variability of the climate.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Antarctica's upside-down ice-scape we had no idea existed\n\u2022\u00a0The 'mind bomb' photos that changed the whaling industry\n\u2022\u00a0Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\nGreenland experienced record ice loss in 2019, shedding a total of 532 billion tonnes from its giant ice sheet, according to a 2020 study. On average, Greenland loses 234 billion tonnes of ice per year\u00a0\u2013 enough to pack into 6,324 Empire State Buildings.\n\"2019 was a really unusually warm year, but so was 2012,\" says Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist at BAS who studies the impacts of Greenland's melting ice sheet. In 2012, the summer period (June-August) was more than 2C (4F) warmer than the average for 1981-2010, and more than 1.5C (3F) warmer for the entire ice sheet. \"Those extremes are coming round more frequently than we had thought they would. They're happening every few years,\" says Hogan.\n\"What's really distinctive about Greenland is how much melting you get on the surface in the summer, because you don't get anywhere near as much as that in Antarctica,\" says Hogan. \"When you see huge volumes of water [on the ice], it is really shocking.\"\nBut it's rare to see \"giant pools of water\" on the surface like in Olsen's photo, says Perren, as usually the water seeps through cracks in the ice. \"It basically pops the ice sheet up and floats it out to the coast. So often you don't have this pooling of water, but instead you have warm water that's being sent down into the bowels of the Greenland ice sheet, basically warming the whole thing,\" she says.\nThe rapid melting of the ice is already affecting local communities' way of life. \"They are having to adapt the way they hunt and fish,\" says Olsen.\nIf the ice is unsafe to travel on, it also makes it more difficult for scientists to carry out their research, Olsen adds. \"We will have to adapt and rely more on automatic instruments instead of community-based monitoring.\"\u00a0\nSafety is already a concern, says Perren, adding: \"I have promised my son that I will not step foot on the ice sheet because it's so dangerous.\"\nThe photo has helped raise awareness of Greenland's vulnerability to climate change, says Olsen. \"I have definitely found that you can get a lot of attention for the problem with a photo\u2026 so it has been very efficient.\n\"But I've also been challenged by people saying: 'how can you take a photo of climate change?' And I agree, you cannot take one photo and call it climate change, because that is something that unfolds over a longer time period,\" says Olsen. \"We need to explain the photo and provide the right context.\"\nPhotos are useful tools for starting conversation about the environment and explaining scientific phenomena, says Perren. \"Science has a communication problem,\" she says.\n\"When I first saw it in 2019 I remember thinking: 'oh my gosh, this is such a shocking image,'\" adds Perren. \"It's a symbolic image of what climate change looks like in Greenland. But there's also a scientific side to it: maybe this is unprecedented but it also [paints] a very good, kind of emblematic picture of what the future would look like.\"\nHogan says that photo \"really drives home the extent of the problem\". \"It looks like the dogs are skating on something without a bottom\u2026 it feels like they could just sink at any moment, which is maybe some sort of metaphor for the ice sheet and the future.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "He was the maverick detective solving crimes across a nine miles by five island in his burgundy Triumph Roadster.\nAnd now the Bergerac reboot is beaming show-stealing Jersey into viewers' homes once more.\nBut how has the island changed since more than 15 million people tuned into BBC One to watch the first episode in October 1981?\nFor Jersey politician Constable Kevin Lewis, who worked on the original show for 10 years, it has changed \"quite a bit\", with some parts \"beyond recognition\". \nIn February, the first episode of the new series was watched live on U&Drama by about 750,000 people and then available to stream.\nJohn Nettles has been replaced by Irish actor Damien Molony, while the famous Roadster has made a triumphant comeback.\nBut Mr Lewis, who worked as a location manager, said many of the places used on the original show were \"long gone\", including the house used for Jim Bergerac\u2019s father-in-law, Charlie Hungerford.\nHe said areas like Jersey\u2019s Waterfront near the town centre had been \u201ccompletely built up\u201d and the island\u2019s tourism industry is not what it used to be in its glamorous heyday.\n\u201cI do miss the old days when we were literally humming with tourists and there were so many tourist-related businesses here,\" he said.\n\u201cA lot of the hotels have been pulled down and turned into accommodation, which is quite sad, but it's the way of the world.\u201d\nMr Lewis said the success of the original Bergerac series did wonders for Jersey\u2019s tourism industry, including its global reach.\nHe explained that one of his responsibilities while working on the series was to look after visiting media -  including one young journalist from Sweden, who he has been married to for 30 years.\nHe said the new series could have a similar effect on tourism but more of the show should have been filmed on the island.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a second series, I would like to see the whole series filmed in Jersey,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking of a tonal difference between the more lighthearted original Bergerac and the Scandi-noir mood of the reboot, Mr Lewis acknowledged that things were \u201ca little darker\u201d for people now.\nHe said politicians in Jersey were doing their best to keep people happy and, largely, life in Jersey was \u201cnot too bad\u201d.\nAlthough many were struggling with the cost of living, \u201cwe\u2019ve got beautiful beaches and we've got plenty to do\u201d, he added.\nNow a Catholic deacon, Brendan Flaxman was a States of Jersey Police officer when the original series of Bergerac was filmed.\nMr Flaxman joined the force in 1979, just before filming started, and was an extra in three of the show\u2019s episodes.\nHe said it was easier for the producers to use real Jersey police officers because they already had the uniforms and cars.\nThe original series captured a lot of Jersey\u2019s differences, he said, adding he did not think that was possible now because the island was more like the rest of the British Isles.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the coastlines and the rest of it, but in business life and everyday life it\u2019s pretty similar to any other place that you\u2019d find in England,\u201d Mr Flaxman said.\nJersey was far more relaxed in the 1980s, he said, with a slower pace of life and more distinct tourism and hospitality industries.\n\u201cNight life has changed drastically, I think it doesn't really exist,\u201d he said.\nUltimately, Mr Flaxman said Jersey was still a fantastic place to live, even though it comes with a high cost of living and housing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a safe and secure place to live and everything's very close,\u201d he added.\nJohn Taylor, chairman of Jersey Pearl, opened pearl and gold showrooms in 1985 and 1986, and was offered the opportunity to buy and display the \"Bergerac car\" in 1987.\nHis daughter Julia Williams, product director at Jersey Pearl, was a child at the time and remembers coachloads of people coming to the showroom to take pictures with \"cardboard Jim\" and sit in the 1947 Triumph Roadster.\nMr Taylor said running a business in Jersey had changed drastically from the 1980s.\n\u201cReally it\u2019s got an awful lot tougher\u2026 basically there were a million customers coming to to Jersey in 1985, now there\u2019s 200,000 - it\u2019s a very different market.\u201d\nHowever, he said people have a \u201cterrible tendency\u201d to say that life was better in the 80's. \nHe said life everywhere, not just in Jersey, had changed and the island was still great.\nMs Williams added that, despite challenges, Jersey was still a \u201cfabulous\u201c place to be and to visit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because we love it, this is a great industry to be in\u2026 everybody is inherently proud of Jersey,\u201d she said.\nFollow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook.

        "summary": "How has Bergerac's island changed since the 1980s?1 day agoShareSaveGemma DaubeneyBBC News, Channel IslandsShareSaveBBCThe first episode of the original Bergerac series was watched by 15 million people, while the first episode of the new series was watched live by 750,000 peopleHe was the maverick detective solving crimes across a nine miles by five island in his burgundy Triumph Roadster.And now the Bergerac reboot is beaming show-stealing Jersey into viewers' homes once more.But how has the island changed since more than 15 million people tuned into BBC One to watch the first episode in October 1981?For Jersey politician Constable Kevin Lewis, who worked on the original show for 10 years, it has changed \"quite a bit\", with some parts \"beyond recognition\". \u2018Not what it was\u2019In February, the first episode of the new series was watched live on U&Drama by about 750,000 people and then available to stream.John Nettles has been replaced by Irish actor Damien Molony, while the famous Roadster has made a triumphant comeback.But Mr Lewis, who worked as a location manager, said many of the places used on the original show were \"long gone\", including the house used for Jim Bergerac\u2019s father-in-law, Charlie Hungerford.He said areas like Jersey\u2019s Waterfront near the town centre had been \u201ccompletely built up\u201d and the island\u2019s tourism industry is not what it used to be in its glamorous heyday.\u201cI do miss the old days when we were literally humming with tourists and there were so many tourist-related businesses here,\" he said.\u201cA lot of the hotels have been pulled down and turned into accommodation, which is quite sad, but it's the way of the world.\u201dKevin LewisKevin Lewis (far left) met his wife while working as a location producer on the original Bergerac seriesMr Lewis said the success of the original Bergerac series did wonders for Jersey\u2019s tourism industry, including its global reach.He explained that one of his responsibilities while working on the series was to look after visiting media -  including one young journalist from Sweden, who he has been married to for 30 years.He said the new series could have a similar effect on tourism but more of the show should have been filmed on the island.\u201cIf there\u2019s a second series, I would like to see the whole series filmed in Jersey,\u201d he said.BBC/UKTVKevin Lewis said the difference in tone between the original and reboot series of Bergerac reflected that things are \u201cdarker\u201d for people in 2025Speaking of a tonal difference between the more lighthearted original Bergerac and the Scandi-noir mood of the reboot, Mr Lewis acknowledged that things were \u201ca little darker\u201d for people now.He said politicians in Jersey were doing their best to keep people happy and, largely, life in Jersey was \u201cnot too bad\u201d.Although many were struggling with the cost of living, \u201cwe\u2019ve got beautiful beaches and we've got plenty to do\u201d, he added.Retired police officer Brendan Flaxman appeared in the background of three of the original Bergerac episodes Now a Catholic deacon, Brendan Flaxman was a States of Jersey Police officer when the original series of Bergerac was filmed.Mr Flaxman joined the force in 1979, just before filming started, and was an extra in three of the show\u2019s episodes.He said it was easier for the producers to use real Jersey police officers because they already had the uniforms and cars.The original series captured a lot of Jersey\u2019s differences, he said, adding he did not think that was possible now because the island was more like the rest of the British Isles.\u2018Nightlife doesn\u2019t exist\u2019\u201cWe\u2019ve got the coastlines and the rest of it, but in business life and everyday life it\u2019s pretty similar to any other place that you\u2019d find in England,\u201d Mr Flaxman said.Jersey was far more relaxed in the 1980s, he said, with a slower pace of life and more distinct tourism and hospitality industries.\u201cNight life has changed drastically, I think it doesn't really exist,\u201d he said.Alcohol law changes plea to save Jersey nightlifeUltimately, Mr Flaxman said Jersey was still a fantastic place to live, even though it comes with a high cost of living and housing.\u201cIt\u2019s a safe and secure place to live and everything's very close,\u201d he added.Jersey PearlThe 1947 Triumph Roadster that John Nettles drove in the Bergerac series was on display in a jewellery showroom in the 1980sJohn Taylor, chairman of Jersey Pearl, opened pearl and gold showrooms in 1985 and 1986, and was offered the opportunity to buy and display the \"Bergerac car\" in 1987.His daughter Julia Williams, product director at Jersey Pearl, was a child at the time and remembers coachloads of people coming to the showroom to take pictures with \"cardboard Jim\" and sit in the 1947 Triumph Roadster.Mr Taylor said running a business in Jersey had changed drastically from the 1980s.\u201cReally it\u2019s got an awful lot tougher\u2026 basically there were a million customers coming to to Jersey in 1985, now there\u2019s 200,000 - it\u2019s a very different market.\u201dHowever, he said people have a \u201cterrible tendency\u201d to say that life was better in the 80's. He said life everywhere, not just in Jersey, had changed and the island was still great.Ms Williams added that, despite challenges, Jersey was still a \u201cfabulous\u201c place to be and to visit.\u201cWe\u2019re here because we love it, this is a great industry to be in\u2026 everybody is inherently proud of Jersey,\u201d she said.Follow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook.

        "article_text": "Mark Carney, an economist and political newcomer, has been sworn in as Canada's new prime minister, and delivered remarks vowing to \"never\" become a part of the United States.\nHe took office on Friday just days after being elected leader of the governing Liberal Party and amid an ongoing trade war with US President Donald Trump.\n\"We know that by building together, we can give ourselves far more than anyone else can take away,\" he said after the ceremony. \nCarney replaces outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in office for nine years, after a landslide victory in last week's Liberal leadership race. \n\"We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the US,\" Carney told reporters in Ottawa on Friday, referring to Trump's musings that Canada join the US as its \"51st state\".\n\"We are very fundamentally a different country,\" he said, later adding the notion is \"crazy\". \nHe declined to answer questions about the timing of Canada's next federal election - currently scheduled for October - but hinted he would move quickly to seek \"as strong a mandate that is needed for the time\".\nIn his first order as prime minister, Carney moved to end a policy that had been frequent attacked against by political opponents. \nHe ended the consumer carbon pricing programme - a key environmental policy under Trudeau that had become deeply unpopular in recent years amid high inflation. \nConservatives have criticised the tax, saying it raised the price of goods and energy for Canadian families.\nAt an afternoon cabinet meeting, Carney said his government will still take steps to fight climate change. An industrial carbon tax on large emitters remains in place. \nCanadians receive a rebate to offset the cost of carbon pricing and will get their final cheque in April.\nCanadian politics in recent months have largely been overshadowed by the trade war Trump launched after taking office in January - and with a general election on the horizon, Carney is expected to pitch himself as the candidate best equipped to take on Trump. \nHe previously held roles as governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, and of the Bank of England, and helped both countries weather major financial disruption. \nHe intends to travel to the UK and France as his first foreign trip as PM next week.\nCarney said he also looks forward to speaking with Trump. \n\"We respect the United States. We respect President Trump,\" he said.\n\"President Trump is has put some very important issues at the top of his agenda.\"\nCarney has promised to uphold Canada's reciprocal tariffs on specific American goods for as long as Trump maintains 25% universal tariffs on Canadian goods not  covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) trade deal.\nCanada is dependent on trade with the US. Economists say it risks a recession if Trump's tariffs are fully imposed. \nSeveral of Carney's new cabinet members served under Trudeau, and in particular he kept on those who have been working directly with the Trump administration in recent months. \nThey including M\u00e9lanie Joly, who remains in foreign affairs; David McGuinty, who remains in public safety; Jonathan Wilkinson, staying on as energy minister; Dominic Leblanc, who has moved from finance to trade; and Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, moved from industry to finance. \nWhen the federal election comes, Carney's main rival will be Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. \nBefore the the threat of tariffs, Conservatives enjoyed a 20-point lead in some election polls. Now polls are indicating a much closer race. \nSpeaking after Carney on Friday, Poilievre argued that Liberals do not deserve a fourth term in office, arguing adding they have already had nine years to improve affordability and other issues in the country.\n\"It will be the same Liberal results,\" he said. \nPoilievre added that if he were to be elected prime minister, he would \"face off against President Trump directly, respond with counter tariffs and take back control\".\nWhen Canadians next go to the polls, the Liberals will face not only the Conservatives - who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons - but also the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats, and the New Democrats (NDP), who have 24.\nReacting to Carney's swearing in, the leader of the NDP argued that his cabinet appointments show that there is no room for progressive Liberals under his leadership. \nJagmeet Singh said that he had failed to create separate cabinet portfolios for minister of women, youth, or people with disabilities, and described Carney as someone who has made billionaires \"very rich at the cost of workers\".",

Then in 1891, a narrow-gauge railway opened, connecting M\u00fcrren to the nearby mountain village of Gr\u00fctschalp and a funicular that reached Lauterbrunnen. In 1965, a single-track cableway opened that could ferry residents down to another traffic-free village, Gimmelwald, above the valley.\nBut the day I arrived, this formerly secluded 430-person hamlet perched 1638m in the Bernese Oberland became directly connected with the outside world and valley below through the opening of the world's steepest cable car: the Schilthornbahn, which whisks travellers 775m up through some of the Swiss Alps' most jaw-dropping scenery in just four minutes.\nAfter arriving at the Stechelberg car park, I was soon being hoisted from the valley floor up in a glass-enclosed cabin, staring down towards the storybook cottages below and surrounded by craggy mountains and snow-covered pines. The trip up the vertical M\u00fcrrenfluh rockface was so smooth that I barely noticed the 159.4% gradient (the world's previous steepest cable car, the Loen Skylift in Norway, rises 133%), until my ears started to pop.\nPerched on a natural terrace at the foot of the Schilthorn summit (2970m) overlooking the Lauterbrunnen valley, M\u00fcrren is a 13th-Century village with traditional stone and timber cottages that looks like it's clinging to the edge of a cliff. Because of its unique position, engineers have never been able to connect it to the outside world by road.\n\"Taking the cable car to school might seem unusual to many, but it was an everyday ritual for me,\" said M\u00fcrren native Michael Abegglen. \"Most everyday necessities and services are available in M\u00fcrren, but every time we need a doctor, hairdresser or dentist, we need to go down to the valley where many of us have our cars parked.\"\nAccording to Abegglen, the village's few year-round residents have long relied on one another. \"When you grow up here like I did, you know almost everyone, and there's a strong close-knit community,\" Abegglen adds. \"Some guests are like locals, as they return to M\u00fcrren every single year.\"\nAfter checking into the Hotel Alpenruh, and admiring the awe-inspiring, 360-degree views of the Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau peaks from my balcony, I soon discovered that \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 this pocket-sized, car-free village is best explored on foot.\nM\u00fcrren's few streets are lined with cosy inns; rustic restaurants serving Alpine cheeses and dry sausages; bars offering evening aperitifs; and quaint souvenir shops selling postcards, fine Swiss chocolates, cuckoo clocks and cowbells. One of M\u00fcrren's main landmarks is the Hotel M\u00fcrren Palace, built in 1874 and nicknamed \"Switzerland's first palace\" after its history of hosting celebrity skiers and Hollywood actors like Rita Hayworth. Oozing elegance and grandeur, its ballroom served as a meeting point for high society back in the 20th Century. As the snow fell, I popped into the pub at the Eiger Guesthouse to warm up over a mug of gl\u00fchwein (traditional mulled wine).\nDespite its diminutive size, M\u00fcrren is a major winter sports hub. This former sleepy Walser settlement transformed in the late 1800s when British skiers discovered the village and fell in love with its scenery (and slopes).\n\"My great-grandfather Henry Lunn first came to M\u00fcrren in the 1890s and was smitten by its breathtaking beauty,\" said Bernard Lunn, a self-proclaimed \"ski bum\" and village resident. \"He soon started bringing British tourists here to witness the glorious 'triumvirate' of [the] Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau peaks. Later, my mountaineer grandfather Arnold Lunn and his wife Mabel started living here, and in 1922, Arnold founded the [world's] first slalom ski races. Mabel and a group of British Women established the Ladies' Ski Club here as well.\"\nArnold's arrival also paved the way for the formation of the Kandahar Ski Club in 1924 and the inauguration of the country's first ski school in M\u00fcrren in 1930.A year later, the first Alpine World Ski Championships kicked off in this tiny town in February 1931.\nNearly a century later, the surrounding mountains are laced with 54km of fresh, powdery pistes connected through cable cars, funiculars and chairlifts. When snow conditions allow, you can ski 16km from the Schilthorn summit to the valley floor in Lauterbrunnen.\n\"A coffee at the peak and a trip down on skis with family and friends is how I love spending my winter days in M\u00fcrren,\" said Alan Ramsay, a sociable Scot who has called the village home for more than 25 years and helps organise the International Inferno, the\u00a0world's biggest amateur ski race held in the town annually (21-24 January 2026).\nBut locals say there's more to M\u00fcrren than just skiing. From June through September, the area becomes a popular paragliding destination, offering magnificent birds-eye views over the region's soaring crags, turquoise lakes and more than 70 cascadingwaterfalls.You can also stroll the flower-studded trails and meadows dotted with grazing sheep.\n\"The mountains are an ever-changing canvas,\" said Belinda B\u00fchler, an avid trail runner who has lived her whole life in M\u00fcrren. \"In the winter, they wear a beautiful white coat. In the summer, the mood changes depending on whether we are having hot, rainy or foggy days. However, as winter slowly departs, you can already smell the scent of spring. As the earth starts to warm up, you see early summer blossoms and soon there are flower-filled meadows.\"\nB\u00fchler's main advice for those coming outside of ski season? \"Get out into nature onto the trails. You don't have to walk too far but as soon as you're on a trail, you're alone and can savour the stillness and beauty most palpably. The air is so pure and clean. I have grown up in Murren but I always call myself a local tourist, as I still tend to stop and take photos during my hikes. What I feel, see and hear on the trails in M\u00fcrren is indescribable!\"\nBernard's wife, Julia Lunn, who leads families and women on hikes in Murren added, \"People don't come here to shop or sightsee, but to experience life through skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, or simple pleasures like taking in the unrivalled views in solitude and dipping into the streams or the unspoiled Grauseeli lake.\"\nAt Ramsay's advice, I decided to experience one of those simple pleasures for myself. After grabbing a wooden sledge from the local Intersport rental shop, I took the funicular up to the Allmendhubel mountain station (the starting point of the infamous 3km Bob Chase featured in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service). After a few quick practice runs, I whisked down the soft, powdery slopes of the Blumental Valley, peppered with pines and chalet-like holiday homes with a sense of wonder and a child-like grin plastered across my face.\n\"When growing up in M\u00fcrren as a child, I didn't realise how lucky I was because I took [this] all for granted,\" said B\u00fchler. \"As a teenager, I even found the village too small and limiting. However, after I travelled around a bit and returned to Murren, I fell in love with it all over again, especially with the sense of freedom it gave me. Today, I often feel speechless when I wake up here and find it hard to describe M\u00fcrren, because no words seem to do its beauty justice. It is a place that needs to be experienced and felt.\"\nEven after just a two-day visit, I think I know what she means.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.\nOfficial decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around a third of those challenges are ultimately upheld at an independent tribunal.\n\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.\nAnother way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.\nAround 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.\nOne potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.\nThe fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.\nHowever, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.\nThe OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).\nAnother potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.\nSome advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.\nThere have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.\nEvaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.\nHowever, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.\nThat implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.\nNevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.\n\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

I have a huge respect for Roy Keane.\n\"Obviously not everything I do everyone will like or think in the same way and I respect everyone's opinion and I have huge respect for Roy Keane and I accept there's a lot of margin for improvement in my game, in my leadership and everything I do in my life.\"\nFernandes has been involved in 31 goals across all competitions this season, with only Mohamed Salah (54) and Erling Haaland (33) having more goal involvements among Premier League players.\nSince his United debut in February 2020, only Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne (90) has recorded more assists across all competitions for a side in Europe's big five leagues than Fernandes (80). \nAfter a routine win at second-bottom Leicester, he told Sky Sports: \"We knew it would be difficult and we had to be at our very best level. First half, we committed mistakes in the transition, but second half we were better at getting control of the game and getting the goals.\n\"Against Arsenal we were a little bit more deep on the pitch, we felt they didn't have much up front in terms of pace.\n\"I think you can see some progress, but that has to go on and on. We have important games.\n\"I want to score many goals as I can as it's a big part of my game and I need to assist my team-mates. I need to get on to the edge of the box and get goals as it is one of my qualities.\"\nAmorim also reserved praise for Fernandes, who set up goals for Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho, before slotting home a late strike.\nThe United boss said: \"He's a special guy in that aspect, he is always ready, he can recover quite well. I don't know the future but I'm reading what the performance department tell me, the numbers, and then what I see in the game.\n\"I always see a Bruno that is dangerous and one Bruno that can recover in every situation. So he is going to stay there.\n\"I already knew Bruno. What surprised me the most is the way he works every day, that was a surprise. \n\"We in Portugal see Bruno with that frustration and I was really surprised, he is a very good professional.

        "article_text": "Viewers and critics have heaped praise on Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, with many hailing it as a landmark TV show.\nThe four-part British series was released last week and is the most-watched show on the platform around the world over the weekend.\nThe Times' Tom Peck described it as \"complete perfection\", a view echoed by the Guardian's Lucy Mangan, who said it was \"the closest thing to TV perfection in decades\".\nFans on social media ranged from US director Paul Feig, who called the first episode \"one of the best hours of television I've ever seen\", to Jeremy Clarkson, who called it \"masterful\".\nAdolescence shows the aftermath of the stabbing of a teenage girl, with a 13-year-old boy from her school arrested for her murder.\nJamie, the young suspect, is played by newcomer Owen Cooper, with Stephen Graham as his dad.\nIts story shines a light on the corrosive impact of social media and misogynist influencers on some teenage boys.\nGraham said he was inspired to make the show after seeing two separate reports of boys stabbing girls to death.\n\"I just thought, what's going on in society where this kind of thing is becoming a regular occurrence?\" he told BBC's The One Show.\n\"I just couldn't fathom it. So I wanted to really have a look and try and shine a light on this particular thing.\"\nWriter Jack Thorne said they wanted to \"look in the eye of male rage\".\nThe central character had been \"indoctrinated by voices\" like Andrew Tate's and \"voices a lot more dangerous than Andrew Tate's\", Thorne told Radio 4's Front Row.\nErin Doherty, who plays a child psychologist, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This show has the bravery to just peel back the layers and go, let's talk about this thing, because we're still dealing with it today. There are still issues cropping up in the news today.\n\"So all we can hold ourselves accountable for is having the discussion, and hopefully that's what it does. It just allows parents, aunties, uncles, even just friends, to engage in the conversation.\"\nEach episode was filmed in a single, uninterrupted take.\nIn the Guardian, Mangan said its technical accomplishments \"are matched by an array of award-worthy performances and a script that manages to be intensely naturalistic and hugely evocative at the same time\".\nShe added: \"Adolescence is a deeply moving, deeply harrowing experience.\"\nPeck's review in the Times began: \"Wow. Just wow. I'm tempted to type out the word 'wow' a further 700 times or so, followed by, 'Don't miss Adolescence on Netflix,' and then be done with it.\"\nThe Telegraph's TV critic Anita Singh said it was \"a devastating watch\", adding: \"It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\" \nSingh said the single-shot technique \"can feel like a gimmick\" but that the acting is \"phenomenal\".\nGraham is \"the best actor working today\", but \"the truly remarkable performance\" is by Cooper, she wrote.\n\"He moves between vulnerability, anger, bravado and fear. What he does here is astonishing.\"\n\nElsewhere, Deadline's Jake Kanter wrote: \"Adolescence is as flawless a four hours of TV drama I have ever seen. It lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled. Astonishing telly.\"\nRolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall said it was \"among the very best things - and an early contender for the best thing - you will see on the small screen this year\".\nThe New York Times' Margaret Lyons called it \"a rich work of social critique\", describing the standout episode, the third, as \"one of the more fascinating hours of TV I've seen in a long time\".\nOn BBC Radio 5 Live's Must Watch, Hayley Campbell said the drama doesn't attempt to solve the problems it raises.\n\"It's bringing it up, it's looking at it. It's about the rise of misogyny, especially in young boys, brought about by people like Andrew Tate, who's namechecked in this, but only once. It's not about him.\n\"The drama is more about the horror of how little control you have over your kid and what they're doing on their phone.\"\nFellow critic Scott Bryan added: \"The performances are absolutely fantastic. I would say this is flawless. The person, though, I think who deserves the most recognition is 15-year-old Owen Cooper.\"",

        "article_text": "Tens of thousands of people have descended on Serbia's capital to protest against the deaths of 15 people in a railway station collapse.\nThe government has put attendance at 107,000 across Belgrade. Organisers and independent monitors have yet to give their estimates. \nEither way, it probably ranks as the largest demonstration Serbia has ever seen.\nThe Novi Sad collapse last November has galvanised anger towards the government and President Aleksandar Vucic. Demonstrators blame corruption and corner-cutting for the loss of life.\nThey believe the disaster reflects more than a decade of governing by the Progressive Party of Vucic - who closely associated himself with the station's recent renovation.\nDespite multiple resignations - and Vucic's insistence that he is going nowhere - the protests have only continued to grow.\n\"We just want a country that works,\" law student Jana Vasic told the BBC in the growing crowd in Belgrade.\n\"We want institutions that do their jobs properly. We don't care what party is in power. But we need a country that works, not one where you don't get justice for more than four months.\"\nRepublic Square - just one of the four meeting points around Serbia's capital for the \"15th for 15\" protest - was full to overflowing on Saturday.\nSome took refuge on the plinth of Prince Mihajlo's statue - the traditional spot for Belgraders to meet, the equivalent of Eros in London's Piccadilly. \nOthers queued up along the road in front of the National Museum, stretching all the way back to Students' Square.\nThe other meeting points were every bit as crowded ahead of the planned rendezvous in front of the National Assembly.\nWhile the protests over the Novi Sad collapse began with students, they have been joined by taxi drivers, farmers and lawyers.\nAhead of the big protest, motorbike riders pulled up outside the National Assembly, facing off against the tractors surrounding a camp of pro-government counter-protesters. \nThen a parade of military veterans received a rousing welcome. They said they would make a citizen's arrest on anyone who attacked the students.\nThe students have been calling for full transparency and accountability over the collapse of a concrete and glass canopy at the station in Serbia's second city, which was renovated and only reopened - by Vucic - in 2022.\nThey want the government to publish all the documentation relating to the renovation project and say they are not satisfied with the papers the authorities have released so far.\nThey also want those responsible for the disaster to be charged and convicted. Prosecutors have indicted at least 16 people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic. \nBut the charges have yet to go to trial. And the students insist they will continue with their protests until the authorities meet all their demands.\n\"We're making progress,\" a student representing Belgrade University's philosophy faculty told the BBC. \"But at this point none of our demands have been met completely.\"\n\"A couple of politicians have resigned from their offices,\" noted another. \"But they weren't fired. We're yet to see anything but empty promises\".\nPrime Minister Milos Vucevic announced his resignation at the end of January. But that has yet to be ratified by the National Assembly and he remains in his post.\nBut the real power in Serbia lies with Vucic, who insists that he is going nowhere.\n\"I don't give in to blackmail,\" he told a media conference on the eve of the big protest. \"I won't allow the street to pave a horrible future for this country.\"\nVucic described the student protests as \"well-intentioned\". But he had less flattering words for opposition parties, labelling them members of a \"criminal cartel\". He accused them of attempting to force the formation of a \"fraudulent interim government\".\nBorko Stefanovic does not deny that the opposition parties are looking for the establishment of a \"government of experts\".\nThe deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice describes it as the \"only rational way out\" of the political crisis, which would establish the conditions for fresh elections. \nLike other opposition leaders, Stefanovic says that free elections are not currently possible due to the Progressive Party's domination of the media and state institutions.\nBut this is not one of the students' demands. They are simply calling for the truth behind the Novi Sad disaster to be established.\nAs law professor Miodrag Jovanovic puts it \"they are asking for the things I've been lecturing about - the rule of law, respect for the constitution, and the responsibility and accountability of public officials\".\nWhatever happens during the \"15th for 15\" protest, it seems unlikely that the students will relent until they receive some satisfactory answers.",

        "article_text": "On Friday, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, found himself in a particularly uncomfortable position.\nPresident Donald Trump was singing his praises. And former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other influential Democrats were expressing their dismay with him \u2013 or worse.\nThis was Schumer's fate the day after he decided to back a Republican-crafted measure to avert a possible US government shutdown this weekend. \nLater, he followed through on his promise, voting with nine other Democrats and all but one Republican to overcome the key procedural hurdle that - if Democrats had stuck together in opposition - would have prevented  the funding bill from coming to a final vote.\nThe Senate bill, which passed that final vote shortly after, contained a number of provisions that angered liberals. These included cuts to non-military programmes, increased spending on border security, limits on how Congress can rescind Trump's tariffs and draconian restrictions on Washington DC's budget.\nSchumer acknowledged all of this, but said he was backing the bill because a shutdown, which would allow the president to determine what government services and employees to suspend, would be worse.\n\"I believe it is the best way to minimise the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,\" he said on Friday. \"Allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via government shutdown is a far worse option.\"\nIt didn't take long after Schumer's announcement for Democratic second guessing \u2013 and straight-up outrage \u2013 to ensue.\n\"Chuck Schumer is unwilling and unable to meet the moment,\" the Democratic group Pass the Torch, which led calls for Joe Biden to end his re-election bid last summer, said in a statement.\nPelosi, who wields considerable influence among House Democrats despite having stepped down from her leadership position, decried what she said was a \"false choice\" between a shutdown and accepting the Republican measure.\n\"We must fight back in a better way,\" she said, suggesting a short-term funding extension and new bipartisan negotiations. She called the Republican bill a \"blank cheque that makes a devastating assault on the well-being of working families across America\".\nIn a Friday press conference, the current House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, dodged questions about Schumer. When asked if he still had confidence in his Senate counterpart, he tersely replied: \"Next question.\"\nOthers in the party were less circumspect. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia told reporters that he expected \"new leadership\" in the Senate next year \u2013 or after the next presidential election in 2028.\nA group of 60 House Democrats \u2013 who joined all but one in their party to vote against the Republican bill in that chamber \u2013 penned a letter to Schumer, saying that the legislation \"potentially legitimises President Trump and the Republican party's dismantling of government\".\n\"If Republicans in Congress want to pass this bill,\" they wrote, \"they should do so with their own votes.\"\nAs if to add rub salt on Democratic wounds, Trump took to his Truth Social website on Friday morning to praise what he said was a \"good and smart move\" by Schumer \u2013 and to promise that more Republican legislation on taxes, spending and \"so much more\" was coming.\n\"This could lead to something big for USA,\" he wrote, \"a whole new direction and beginning!\"\nWhile many rank-and-file Democrats and liberal activists clamoured for Schumer and Senate Democrats to block the House measure even if it triggered a government shutdown, it is unclear whether such a move would have pressured Trump and Republicans to negotiate a less partisan government-funding bill.\nIn fact, there are many on the right, including Trump's designated government slasher, Elon Musk, who were relishing an opportunity to use a shutdown to further hamstring the federal bureaucracy. \nAfter days, or weeks, of shutdown pain that would disproportionately affect their supporters, the Democratic Party could have found itself in the same place it is now \u2013 with limited power and few good options.\n\"Neither House Democrats nor the people voting 'no' in the Senate nor the people getting mad on Twitter have an actual strategy for getting what the base wants out of this, which is some kind of act of Congress saying that Trump and Musk need to conduct the government differently,\" writes Matthew Yglesias, a left-leaning commentator.\nDemocrats have the power to block Republican legislation, but they simply don't have the votes to advance their own alternative either in the House or the Senate.\nThat doesn't make the situation Schumer and the Democrats have found themselves in any easier to stomach, however. Republicans, by sticking together, have been able to exert their will in Congress, while Trump pushes the boundaries of presidential power.\nElections, as they say, have consequences.

It's amazing,\" he says.\nIt even makes the three-hour commute he makes some days to train with the likes of UFC interim champion Tom Aspinall and KSW heavyweight champion Phil De Fries worth it.\n\"I could be going to like a building site in the freezing cold, which I would absolutely hate,\" he adds. \n\"I enjoy this, or sometimes it's a bit 'what are you being sad for? You've got an amazing life at the moment'.\"\nParkin is on a four-fight winning streak in the UFC. He signed with the UFC after just six bouts on his record.\nThe Sunderland man has been somewhat fast-tracked in the promotion thanks in part to the ever-changing nature of the division he fights in and his closeness with one of the UFC's biggest star, Aspinall.\nHe earned a spot on Dana White's Contender Series in 2022 and won himself a UFC contract with a first-round stoppage.\nBefore then, Parkin was working security at a bar, regularly travelling to Sunderland games.\nHis mother pushed him to try out the jiu-jitsu gym and from there he transitioned from kickboxing into MMA.\n\"I don't think I'd be anywhere near where I'm at now without Phil and Tom and coach [Andrew] Fisher,\" he says.\n\"I went [to train with Aspinall] and I thought I was really good and I just got knocked off. Really bad. I thought, 'oh my god', I'm useless at this. It's like starting again.\nHe adds: \"I know I haven't had many fights in the UFC but I'm already ranked. \n\"Heavyweight, you get pushed a little bit more, because there's just not many of us.\nDe Fries - globetrotter finds home as KSW heavyweight champ\nParkin trains with Phil De Fries (left) and Tom Aspinall during his camps\nThe heavyweight scene in the UK has often been scarce. Parkin says he turned pro because he struggled for opponents in the amateur ranks.\nBut recent years have seen two key men emerge and find success in very different factions. \nManchester fighter Aspinall, 31, shot through the UFC ranks and is now the number one heavyweight contender in the UFC, waiting for his shot at champion and legend Jon Jones.\nSunderland's De Fries, 38, is one of KSW's biggest star. He is the European promotion powerhouse's most dominant champion with eleven successful defences since 2018.\n'Extraordinary' - the case for Aspinall to fight Jones in numbers\nParkin sits number 13 in the UFC's rankings. He fights number eight contender Marcin Tybura at UFC London on Saturday. \nThe heavyweight division, not unlike boxing, continues to dominate attention in the UFC.\nThe scene is primed for another heavyweight to step up and under the tutelage of Aspinall and De Fries, Parkin could be that fighter.\nBut that doesn't mean Parkin has any aspirations to fight Aspinall in the future, quite the opposite.\n\"I wouldn't want to fight him. He's my friend, but I was hoping by the time I got there he'd be completely done, and maybe hopefully get this Jon Jones fight and get loads of money and retire,\" Parkin says.\n\"But I'm still loads of fights off that yet, and like, unless it was for crazy money, I just wouldn't want to fight him, really.\n\"I'm 13th ranked now. I know I'm fighting eighth but there's still potentially 15 guys I have to beat to even get there.\"\n\"I think Tybura had like 20 odd UFC fights,\" Parkin adds. \n\"So you kind of can't be not good having 20 UFC fights, you know. I do think I'm probably better than him. I do believe that.\"\nMMA schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

Getty ImagesJerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve (left) and Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, walk the grounds during the Jackson Hole economic symposium in 2019Crossing paths with TrumpCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.

The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politicsEarly life and childhoodAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship.",

        "article_text": "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.\nFilm critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.\nIt is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".\nPaste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".\nThere have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".\nBut overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.\nCritics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday. \nIt fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.\n\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.\nSandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".\n\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.\nBad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"\nWhile a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.\nThe Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.\nIt also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.\nThe Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.\nThe film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.\nThe streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements. \n\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.\n\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"\nRed Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.\nOther recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.\nBrooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.\nThey are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.\nIn December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".\n\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.\n\"But it does depend on the movie.\"\nNetflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.\nAnother critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.\n\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.\n\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.\n\"And it just feels like really, really bad value for money at that point.\"",

BBC Sport takes a look at who's involved and what to watch out for.\nThis video can not be played\n'It's about recovering and moving to the next game' - White on Chelsea's quadruple hopes\nGiven Emma Hayes' success during her 12-year spell as Chelsea manager, it was a lot to expect for new boss Sonia Bompastor to rival such achievements when she took over.\nHowever, the transition has been seamless. After 28 games, the Frenchwoman has yet to taste defeat as Blues boss, winning 26 games and drawing just twice.\nChelsea's quadruple hopes are still alive after Saturday's 2-1 League Cup final triumph over Manchester City. A sixth successive WSL title is almost within reach, and they are in the semi-finals of the FA Cup.\nThe Women's Champions League is the only major trophy that Chelsea have not won, but Bompastor has plenty of European experience - winning the tournament twice as a player, while she guided Lyon to the trophy in 2022.\nThe team have Champions League winners Lucy Bronze and Keira Walsh in their ranks, with the latter arriving from Barcelona in January, while they also strengthened their backline with the world record signing of American Naomi Girma.\nNick Cushing is back at Manchester City, five years after leaving the club in 2020\nHaving pushed Chelsea all the way in the WSL title race last season, missing out only on goal difference, Manchester City have had a frustrating domestic campaign so far.\nBefore this four-game run against Chelsea, City made the bold move to sack manager Gareth Taylor and re-hire former boss Nick Cushing on an interim basis.\nIn the WSL, City are fourth and sit 12 points behind the Blues with just six league matches remaining.\nRealistically, City's hopes of silverware this season rest on the Champions League and FA Cup, but on both fronts Chelsea could be the side that deny them.\nCushing led City to two Champions League semi-finals in his previous spell as manager. To make it a hat-trick, his side will have to upset Bompastor's Blues.\nArsenal have a perfect record in the Women's Champions League since Renee Slegers took charge of the Gunners in October 2024\nArsenal remain the only English team to have won the Women's Champions League.\nHowever, that was back in 2007. They haven't made it to the final since.\nUnder Jonas Eidevall, the Gunners' group stage got off to a shaky start with a 5-2 defeat at Bayern Munich - the Swedish manager's penultimate game before he resigned.\nBut they have had more success since Renee Slegers took over, with Arsenal winning their remaining five group matches by an aggregate score of 15-4 to top Group C.\nSlegers has transformed the north London team into a winning machine with 18 victories in her 22 games as manager.\nReal Madrid are the only remaining side in the competition never to have reached a Champions League semi-final, so being paired with them could be seen as a favourable draw for Arsenal.\nThe Spanish side stand in Barcelona's shadow in Liga F, while Chelsea beat them in their two group encounters.\nBarcelona have won each of the last two Women's Champions League finals\nIt has been almost 10 years since a team other than Lyon or Barcelona lifted the Champions League trophy - Frankfurt taking the honours in 2015.\nBarcelona are going for three in a row after retaining their title with a 2-0 win over Lyon in last year's final.\nBut, as Manchester City showed in the group stages and Liga F minnows Levante   demonstrated last month, Barcelona can be beaten.\nLyon, on the other hand, might prove trickier. The eight-time Champions League winners have yet to lose this season, except for a penalty shootout loss to Reims in the Coupe de France.\nJust as Bompastor has excelled since succeeding Hayes at Chelsea, so Joe Montemurro has been outstanding as Bompastor's Lyon replacement.\nThe French league leaders have won 21 of their 23 games this season, while they conceded just one goal in their six European group matches.\nOne English team is guaranteed a semi-final spot\nThe draw for the rest of the Women's Champions League took place on 7 February, with the route to the final now mapped out.\nThe winners of Wolfsburg v Barcelona will play the winners of Manchester City v Chelsea in the semi-final, with Real Madrid or Arsenal playing the winners of Bayern Munich v Lyon.\nEstadio Jose Alvalade, home of Sporting, will host this year's Women's Champions League final\nQuarter-finals\n(times all GMT)\nFirst leg\n18 March: Real Madrid v Arsenal (17:45), Bayern Munich v Lyon (20:00)\n19 March: Wolfsburg v Barcelona (17:45), Manchester City v Chelsea (20:00)\nSecond leg\n26 March: Lyon v Bayern Munich (17:45), Arsenal v Real Madrid (20:00)\n27 March: Barcelona v Wolfsburg (17:45), Chelsea v Manchester City (20:00)\nSemi-finals\nFirst leg: 19-20 April\nSecond leg: 26-27 April\nFinal\nSaturday, 24 May",

In total, 155 were injured at the concert.\nBiljana Arsovska said short-term detentions had been issued for 10 suspects believed to be responsible for the fire - including \"officials from the ministries which gave out this licence\".\nInterior Minister Pance Toskovski said on Sunday afternoon the venue did not have a legal licence to operate, while police are looking into whether bribery and corruption were linked to the fire are under way.\nThe venue, in a town around 100km (60 miles) east of the capital, Skopje, has been described as an \"improvised nightclub\" in the local press, having previously been a carpet warehouse.\nMs Arsovska said there had been only \"one efficient exit\" in the building, as the venue's back door was locked and could not be used. \nThe first on-site inspections on Sunday had also showed several \"abnormalities\" in the venue. \"There are deficiencies in the system for fire-extinguishing and the system for lightning,\" she said.\nCiting initial reports, Toskovski said the fire had been started by sparks from pyrotechnic devices that had hit the ceiling, which was made of highly flammable material.\nFootage shows the band - which formed in 2002 and has topped the North Macedonian charts over the past decade - playing on stage when two flares go off, after which sparks catch fire on the ceiling before spreading rapidly. \nVideo verified by the BBC shows people trying to extinguish the flames on the ceiling. The footage shows the club was still full and some people appeared to be watching efforts to put out the fire rather than leaving.\nReports suggest the fact there was only a single entry and exit point to the improvised nightclub caused panic.\nMarija Taseva, 20, told Channel 5 TV she was caught in a crush at the club as people rushed for the exits. She recalled falling to the ground and being trampled during the chaos before managing to get out.\n\"I don't know how, but somehow I managed to get out,\" she told the Reuters news agency. \"I'm fine now, but there are many dead.\"\nShe added that her 25-year-old sister - who her family had previously been searching for - had died, saying: \"I was saved and she wasn't.\"\nRed Cross volunteer Mustafa Saidov said most of those affected were young people aged 18 to 20.  Officials say more than 20 of the injured and three of those killed were under 18.\n\"The situation is brutal, chaotic, the stories are very sad, and unfortunately many young lives are lost,\" Mr Saidov added.\nDr Vladislav Gruev, a specialist in reconstructive and plastic surgery at the University Clinic for Surgical Diseases in the capital, told the BBC most of the patients being treated at his hospital arrived with extensive burns.\n\"[They have] second and third degree burns in the head, neck and upper torso,\" he said.\nKocani's hospital director earlier said that staff had initially been struggling to identify patients due to a lack of ID cards. Eighteen patients were assessed as being in a critical condition.\nPrime Minister Hristijan Mickoski called it a \"difficult and very sad day\" for the country, which had lost many \"young lives\".\nThe government has declared seven days of national mourning, and the government is holding an emergency session as part of ongoing investigations on how the incident unfolded.\nNorth Macedonia's President, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, said she was shocked \"as a mother, as a person, as a president\". Addressing the bereaved directly, she added: \"Your immense pain is mine too.\"\n\"No business or activity can function without standards and rules,\" she wrote in a statement. \"Let us not allow anyone to endanger the lives of innocent people again.\"\nSiljanovska-Davkova added that the most seriously injured were being taken to received treatment in specialist clinics in Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey. \nEuropean leaders have voiced their condolences, with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen saying the EU \"stands in solidarity with the people of North Macedonia in this difficult time\".\nNeighbouring Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic called it \"a tragedy of immense magnitude\", adding that fears remain as \"many more people will not be able to withstand the level of injuries they have at this moment\".\nAdditional reporting by Richard Irvine-Brown\nHave you been affected by the nightclub fire in North Macedonia?

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A cancer charity has said it is \"angry and frustrated\" that ministers and health officials have not approved the provision of a life-extending prostate cancer drug through the NHS in England.\nThe drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.\nIn a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\". \nThe government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.\nThe charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"\nAlthough not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body. \nIn England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already. \nIn Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.\nResearch has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.\nThe charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022. \nIt found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment. \nAccording to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread. \nUsing the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.\nIn October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England. \nHe chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not. \nAt the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men. \nHowever, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\". \nBecause abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.\nEach year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug. \nSmyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.\nMr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales. \nHe has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be.

Arsenal, in second, have an eight-point cushion to Newcastle in sixth so should secure another.\nHowever, with 10th-placed Fulham just five points off fifth, as many as eight teams probably remain in the mix for the final three places.\nCrystal Palace, in 11th, are in great form but closing a nine-point feels too big an ask, especially given the number of sides they would have to overhaul.\nWith 10 games left for most, BBC Sport looks at the eight clubs in contention and the challenges they will have to overcome to claim one of those lucrative places. Plus Phil McNulty gives his predictions on where each club will finish and fans have their say on why they back their team in the race for Europe...\nThis video can not be played\nNottingham Forest manager Nuno reflects on big win against Manchester City\nNuno Espirito Santo's side have been this season's surprise package (and a big one at that), going from a relegation scrap last term to challenging at the top, claiming famous wins at Anfield and Old Trafford along the way. Dreams of the title have faded since the start of the year but they remain in a great position to end a memorable campaign celebrating Champions League qualification.\nKey fixtures: The week after March's international break looks huge for Forest. After an FA Cup quarter-final at Brighton, they host Manchester United on 1 April before travelling to fellow top-five hopefuls Aston Villa four days later.\nShould it go down to the wire, expect quite the atmosphere when Forest face Chelsea at the City Ground on the final day of the season in what could be a winner-takes-all match.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Fourth\nWhat a story it will be for this great old club with the rich history of two European Cup wins under Brian Clough to return to the elite competition.\nAnd the surge of belief that swept around the atmospheric City Ground after the win against Manchester City makes you believe the force is with Nuno's side.\nThey have a top-class goalkeeper in Matz Sels, formidable central defenders in Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic, quality in midfield and out wide with Morgan Gibbs-White and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Throw in a striker having the season of his life in Chris Wood and a top-four place is there for the taking.\nOpta's prediction: 73.1% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nMossy: Best defence in the Premier League.\nStuart: Great business, great recruitment, great morals and an incredible work-rate.\nSteve: Forest will continue to do what they've done for most of the games so far, defend well and catch teams on the break.\nCole Palmer is Chelsea's top goalscorer in the Premier League but has gone seven league games without a goal\nAs recently as December, Chelsea were being mentioned as title challengers. Manager Enzo Maresca was quick to dismiss such talk before a post-Christmas slump that led to them dropping out of the Champions League spots. Back-to-back league wins suggest they might be finding form again at just the right time, though.\nKey fixtures: If Chelsea are to make the top five, they will really have earned it given their remaining fixtures. They travel to Arsenal on Sunday, then host rivals Tottenham before tricky games at Brentford and Fulham in April.\nIn May they face Liverpool and Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, either side of a trip to Newcastle, before that potentially crucial trip to Nottingham Forest on the last day.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Fifth\nTouted as title contenders at one point, there has been a drop off in form but Maresca still has lots of quality at his disposal. Cole Palmer is the shining symbol of that.\nMaresca's studied passing style of football has yet to fully win over Stamford Bridge and the fixture list is tough, but they should have enough to claim the fifth place which may secure Champions League football next season.\nOpta's prediction: 54.5% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nJohn: We'll qualify for Champions League because key players - including Nico Jackson - will come back from injury, Cole Palmer will find his form, and Enzo Maresca will loosen his system a bit and let these guys play the way they want to play.\nFahey: Our remaining 10 fixtures should result in 19-21 points, making 68-70 points overall. I think 65 will be enough to get fifth place.\nMatthew: Chelsea will qualify for the Champions League not on merit but because everyone else's form is also sketchy and others' inability to get results over the line will get us top five by default.\nThis video can not be played\n'He knows he should have saved that' - Hart on Ederson\nIn Pep Guardiola's time as manager, Champions League qualification has been a formality for City. However, injury problems and a once-formidable squad starting to show signs of age means it is just a matter of time before the defending champions relinquish their crown - and they still have work to do to book their place at Europe's top table next season.\nKey fixtures: In-form Brighton travel to the Etihad on Saturday with the chance to leapfrog City with a win, while Guardiola's side face Manchester United at Old Trafford early in April.\nBournemouth at home and Fulham away end City's league season and that could be very interesting should either side remain in the top-five hunt.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Third\nCity finishing in third place in the Premier League was unthinkable at the start of the season after four straight titles but they would gratefully settle for it now after a mediocre campaign by their own standards.\nThey still have some ground to make up, but with the quality still in Guardiola's squad and the goals of Erling Haaland, they should get that top-three place and go into the Champions League next season.\nOpta's prediction: 81.3% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nScott: Manchester City will qualify for the Champions League via their league position after a run of eight wins from their final 10 games.\nMark: City will qualify because the teams around them are even more unreliable when it comes to winning games.\nOnly Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland have scored more than Alexander Isak in the Premier League this season\nAfter a taste of the Champions League last season, a year without European football looked like the perfect opportunity for Newcastle to get themselves back there. Alexander Isak spearheaded a brilliant mid-season run to raise hopes they could kick on for a top-three finish, but three losses in their last five games, coupled with some untimely injuries, slowed their momentum.\nKey fixtures: An away game against Aston Villa is the standout of a busy April in which Newcastle play six times in the league - with four home matches. A very tricky May follows, in which they travel to Brighton and Arsenal with Chelsea coming to St James' Park in between.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Sixth\nThis has been a mixed season, but eyes are firmly on that first major domestic prize in 70 years with the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday.\nEddie Howe has a talented squad when fully fit, with a world-class striker in Isak. Top four may be beyond them but European football should not, irrespective of whether they end that long wait for a big trophy - their first since the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.\nOpta's prediction: 50.7% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nJohn: It's not a difficult run-in and with six of the final 10 games at home, Eddie Howe has the expert ability to implement the right tactics to deliver success.\nConnor: Eddie Howe is the best thing at this club in over 20 years and knows exactly what he's doing.\nBen: Alexander Isak - nothing more to say.\nBrighton are on their longest winning run in the league since April 2017\nBrighton look to have hit form at just the right time in Fabian Hurzeler's first season in charge, winning their past four league matches. With an FA Cup quarter-final to look forward to as well, the Seagulls could be heading for a thrilling conclusion to the campaign.\nKey fixtures: After taking on Manchester City on Saturday, Brighton host Aston Villa in their first league match after the international break, then travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace. Home games against Newcastle and Liverpool follow in May before a trip to Tottenham on the final day.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Ninth\nMomentum is all in the latter stages of the season and Brighton have it, as Hurzeler has engineered a remarkable run of six straight wins since the 7-0 loss at Nottingham Forest.\nThey can exact revenge on Forest in the FA Cup quarter-final, and anything is possible in their current form. They could yet make a nonsense of this prediction if it carries on, and they will really fancy their chances in the FA Cup.\nOpta's prediction: 18.1% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPeter: The team play as a cohesive unit, believing in their potential to win against any opposition and backed up by an exemplar management structure, other clubs would be proud of.\nIan: Brighton have the momentum and there are no immovable objects in our way.\nMax: They have belief in themselves and are not afraid of any club.\nThis video can not be played\nEmery praises 'fantastic' Aston Villa defence\nIt has been a strange year for Aston Villa with Unai Emery's side thrilling in Europe but frustrating in the league. Given their Champions League exertions, perhaps the inconsistent league form shouldn't be too much of surprise. But, with one fewer game left to play than their rivals, Villa need to find last season's consistency for the next two months if they want to be back among Europe's elite in 2025-26.\nKey fixtures: For all that two-legged quarter-final against Paris St-Germain will draw the eye, Villa have got some tricky league fixtures in April as well.\nBrighton at home and Forest away start the month, Newcastle at Villa Park and Manchester City away end it. With Fulham, Bournemouth, Tottenham and Manchester United to follow in May, it doesn't get a whole lot easier.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Seventh\nVilla's Premier League form has been up and down but Emery is the master of Europe and cup competitions and they are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and FA Cup. They must be serious contenders in the latter with a last-eight game at Preston North End.\nWill this be a distraction from the league? Time will tell, but Europe can still be achieved through the league, although repeating last season's top-four finish may be out of reach.\nOpta's prediction: 6.9% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPrit: Strength in depth and the master strategist that is Unai Emery.\nMichael: We have a better manager, better squad and a much better fanbase than the opposing teams!\nThis video can not be played\n'Desire and intent' - Rooney full of praise for Bournemouth's front three\nDespite a terrible run with injuries, Bournemouth have continued to impress under Andoni Iraola this season. They've beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Nottingham Forest at home, thumped Newcastle at St James' Park and reached an FA Cup quarter-final. Adding Champions League qualification to the list should not be ruled out.\nKey fixtures: With games at Arsenal and Manchester City to come in May, as well as a home match against Aston Villa, Bournemouth are likely to need a big April if they're to break into the top five. Given their only match against another side in the top half is at home to Fulham, the chance is there for them.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Eighth\nBournemouth are another team who will have eyes on what looks like a wide-open last eight in the FA Cup, although they have to navigate their way past Manchester City in the quarter-final.\nIraola has produced a top-class team with an intensity that makes them an eye-catching, entertaining watch. Will the FA Cup focus their minds more than the league?\nEither way it has been another season of progress for the Cherries and a top-10 place is surely theirs.\nOpta's prediction: 14.3% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nAndrew: We will qualify for the Champions League because Iraola will keep them running and pushing forward until the very last second of the very last game.\nJules: Bournemouth play an aggressive game, press hard, never give up and they've got a great manager.\nRoss: Andoni Iraola has transformed Bournemouth and he and the team deserve it.\nRaul Jimenez is Fulham's top scorer with 10 goals in the Premier League\nFulham are enjoying another excellent season with Marco Silva leading them to an FA Cup quarter-final and keeping them firmly in contention for a European place. The Cottagers are outsiders for a Champions League spot but draws against Arsenal and Liverpool, plus league doubles over Nottingham Forest and Newcastle, have shown what they're capable of.\nKey fixtures: Fulham face the top two in the space of five days in April - Arsenal away followed by Liverpool at Craven Cottage. Then it's Bournemouth and Chelsea before they go to Aston Villa and local rivals Brentford in May, finishing at home to Manchester City.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Tenth\nFulham have enjoyed another solid season of progress under the excellent coaching of Marco Silva and - add them to the list - will feel they have real chances in the FA Cup after winning on penalties at Manchester United.\nTenth is probably the highest they can reach but that represents another fine campaign. Could the FA Cup provide the icing?\nOpta's prediction: 1.2% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPatrick: Only two more of our league games for the season are against teams below us but we have proven our worth against the elite teams and that mindset will allow us to make it into a Champions League position.\nLuke: We have by far the hardest set of fixtures which I think favours Fulham because we play well against the best.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Lewis Hamilton is starting his 19th season in Formula 1\nAustralian Grand Prix\nVenue: Albert Park, Melbourne Date: Sunday, 16 March Race start: 04:00 GMT\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 03:30. Live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nThere was no fairytale for Lewis Hamilton on his first competitive outing for Ferrari, as Formula 1's most celebrated driver began his career with the sport's most iconic team.\nThe seven-time world champion qualified only eighth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - one place and 0.218 seconds slower than his team-mate Charles Leclerc, and a whopping 0.877secs behind Lando Norris' McLaren on pole position.\nAfterwards, Hamilton was repeating the mantra he has been using for some time - that it is going to take a little time before he is fully up to speed with his new car and team.\n\"For me, just improving every single lap, session on session,\" he said. \"Big learning curve this weekend.\n\"The car was so much different than I have ever experienced here and it's been a lot slower process to build confidence in the car.\n\"In the high-speed [corners], I have been down all weekend to Charles, who has had confidence from the get-go. He knew what the car does. I was just building up to that. I got a lot closer in the end and to be that close to Charles in my first qualifying session against a great qualifier...\"\nNorris takes Melbourne pole with Hamilton eighth\nAustralian Grand Prix Qualifying Review\nHe didn't complete the sentence, but the meaning was clear - Leclerc is blindingly fast; everyone knows that. So from Hamilton's point of view, in terms of his own relative performance, this was a perfectly decent start.\nThe same could not be said of Ferrari themselves. Hamilton is at Ferrari with one objective only - to win an eighth world title. Leclerc himself spoke on Thursday about winning a championship with Ferrari being his \"obsession\". Neither will achieve their aims with a car that qualifies on the fourth row of the grid.\nLeclerc was perplexed by what had happened. He had been quick all weekend, and fourth fastest in the first qualifying session, just over 0.1secs off Norris, who topped all three. But it became progressively worse as the hour developed.\n\"As soon as we started to push the car more and more,\" Leclerc said, \"we found more and more inconsistency, which was a bit of a shame.\n\"We lost the pace a little bit through qualifying. In Q1 we were good, in Q2 we were less good and in Q3 we had to push a lot to try and nail the lap time. We didn't really follow the track for some reason.\n\"This car has a lot of potential but for now we don't seem to be in the right window, so we have to find it.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBig surprises & how will Hamilton do?: BBC 5 Live team share 2025 predictions\nIt was a sobering start to a season that all in F1 had expected to start with Ferrari as McLaren's closest challenger. But not everyone felt it was necessarily a reflection of the team's true potential.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"I am certainly surprised at the gap between McLaren and Ferrari. But I would say more, I just don't take that gap at face value.\n\"I'm sure the potential of the red car is higher than for some reasons was possible to exploit today. I think we have seen that until possibly qualifying in every single session, even in Bahrain [at pre-season testing].\n\"So we are very realistic that Ferrari is definitely one of the main contenders.\"\nLando Norris has spent his entire F1 career with McLaren since making his debut in 2019\nHamilton at Ferrari - his personal quest for success, and the internal battle with Leclerc - is one of the dominant narratives at the start of this season.\nAnother is whether Norris can deliver on his ambition to mount a season-long title challenge from the off, rather than having to play catch-up - which he had to try to do last year because McLaren did not start on Red Bull's level.\nIn the end in Melbourne, McLaren did deliver on their potential, but not without a few scary moments.\nFacing a tougher challenge from Red Bull and Max Verstappen than they - and the four-time champion himself - had expected, Norris and Oscar Piastri both made mistakes on their first laps in the final part of qualifying.\nThat put them under pressure on their last runs - lacking a competitive first lap always makes finding the right balance of risk and reward on that all-important final lap much more difficult, because the penalty of making a mistake is so much greater.\nFor home favourite Piastri, this was bad enough - he was fourth after his first run. Norris, though, was 10th, having had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits.\nBoth absolutely nailed it. Piastri, hoping to become the first Australian to win his home grand prix in F1, improved by a second, knocking Verstappen from the top, and Norris did even better, pipping his team-mate by 0.084secs.\nNorris said. \"It's a track where you've got to commit. You know what your target is, and once you turn in you're kind of hoping for the best in a lot of cases. You want to take those risks.\n\"Obviously, I took too many on my first lap and got track limits, so I was in a difficult position knowing how much risk I wanted to take. But I put it together well. It was just a clean lap, no mistakes, and that was enough. So happy. A perfect way to start the season.\"\nMcLaren ended last year with their first constructors' championship title for 26 years, and Stella has said they have taken some risks with \"innovative\" design in pushing for more performance from a car that was the fastest in the field for the second half of last year.\nAlthough all the teams arrived in Melbourne expecting them to be at the front, Norris on Thursday described the idea they might be a chunk ahead of the rest as \"short-sighted\".\nIn the end, at least on the quick, demanding street circuit of Albert Park, he was the one who had to recalibrate.\n\"It really was not necessarily our expectation to have a bit of a gap to the rest of the cars,\" Norris said, before pointing to the fact that the errors they made were due to the difficulty in nailing a lap in a car that has taken the team to new heights.\n\"The car is extremely quick. And when you put it together, it's unbelievable. It's just difficult to put it together. So really it was like a little fight between me and Oscar today, and it was a tough one.\"\nMax Verstappen retired with a brake failure after just four laps of last year's race in Melbourne\nVerstappen might have been pleasantly surprised to be best of the rest, but the 0.385secs margin between him and Norris, while perhaps expected, will have been less palatable.\nFor his team, though, there are concerns on more than one level. On top of the apparent gap to McLaren, there was the performance of their new recruit Liam Lawson.\nAfter paying off Sergio Perez to leave just seven months after being given a new two-year contract, the last thing Red Bull will have wanted to see was Lawson more than 0.6secs off Verstappen on the first day's practice.\nLawson was then hit with an engine problem that robbed him of the entire final session on Saturday. In that context, it was no surprise that he should struggle in qualifying.\nEven so, a first lap a second off Verstappen, and a mistake on his second - putting him on to the grass and down in 18th on the grid - was not a good start.\nLawson is two places behind 18-year-old Italian Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Hamilton's replacement at Mercedes. Antonelli, who will become the third youngest driver to start an F1 race on Sunday, had his qualifying compromised by damage to the floor of his car. The other Mercedes of George Russell will start alongside Verstappen in fourth.\nThere was an impressive performance from another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto in the Sauber, a bad start to his first full season for Haas' British novice Oliver Bearman, and promise from Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin that was not delivered when an off in the second session damaged his floor.\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nMany would want a straightforward first race of the season. But Albert Park has a habit of throwing up curveballs, and it seems the weather may oblige on Sunday, with rain predicted.\n\"It's a new car,\" Norris said. \"So there are a lot of unknowns and question marks about how it will perform. It's not always as simple as just putting on wets and having a crack.\n\"A bit of our pace potentially goes out of the window because it's harder to extract and show the difference of pace we had today. But we're in the best position to do that if we can. I know the chances of rain have been going down, but normally wet races and inter races are pretty exciting.\"\nWhat he did not mention is that the rain brings Verstappen - who would not expect to match the McLarens in a dry race - right into the picture.\nStella was less reticent.\n\"The only thing I can say about Max in the wet is that he is mega,\" he said. \"He can be a significant threat.\"\nHamilton, too, has made a reputation for being special when it rains. But his circumstances mean he will not be treating it with the usual smile.\n\"The wet has often been something I have enjoyed,\" Hamilton said. \"So it's a comfort zone for me but I am going out for the first time in the wet in an uncomfortable position because I have never driven this car.\n\"It is going to be a shock to the system when I first get out there, but I will be learning on the fly and giving it everything.\"\nBritish driver Nigel Mansell won his first race for Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix.

        "summary": "\"Norris and Piastri 'nail' final laps after mistakesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris has spent his entire F1 career with McLaren since making his debut in 2019Hamilton at Ferrari - his personal quest for success, and the internal battle with Leclerc - is one of the dominant narratives at the start of this season.Another is whether Norris can deliver on his ambition to mount a season-long title challenge from the off, rather than having to play catch-up - which he had to try to do last year because McLaren did not start on Red Bull's level.In the end in Melbourne, McLaren did deliver on their potential, but not without a few scary moments.Facing a tougher challenge from Red Bull and Max Verstappen than they - and the four-time champion himself - had expected, Norris and Oscar Piastri both made mistakes on their first laps in the final part of qualifying.That put them under pressure on their last runs - lacking a competitive first lap always makes finding the right balance of risk and reward on that all-important final lap much more difficult, because the penalty of making a mistake is so much greater.For home favourite Piastri, this was bad enough - he was fourth after his first run. \"It's a new car,\" Norris said. Live text updates on BBC Sport website and appThere was no fairytale for Lewis Hamilton on his first competitive outing for Ferrari, as Formula 1's most celebrated driver began his career with the sport's most iconic team.The seven-time world champion qualified only eighth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - one place and 0.218 seconds slower than his team-mate Charles Leclerc, and a whopping 0.877secs behind Lando Norris' McLaren on pole position.Afterwards, Hamilton was repeating the mantra he has been using for some time - that it is going to take a little time before he is fully up to speed with his new car and team. \"It really was not necessarily our expectation to have a bit of a gap to the rest of the cars,\" Norris said, before pointing to the fact that the errors they made were due to the difficulty in nailing a lap in a car that has taken the team to new heights. I got a lot closer in the end and to be that close to Charles in my first qualifying session against a great qualifier...\"Norris takes Melbourne pole with Hamilton eighthPublished10 hours agoAustralian Grand Prix Qualifying ReviewHe didn't complete the sentence, but the meaning was clear - Leclerc is blindingly fast; everyone knows that.",

        "article_text": "Rory McIlroy is the first European to win the Players Championship more than once\nRory McIlroy woke early, far too early. It was 03:00 on Monday morning and his stomach was already starting to churn. He was three holes away from winning a second Players Championship and he felt the trophy should already be his.\nWould this prove another big victory to elude him? The world number 57, JJ Spaun, stood between him and one of the most coveted crowns in the game.\nAs it turned out, the 35-year-old Northern Irishman was going to be able to celebrate this St Patrick's Day in style. McIlroy channelled his nerves while his American opponent faltered - his hopes drowning when he overshot the island green 17th, the second of the three play-off holes.\nIt sets up McIlroy perfectly for his latest tilt at completing the career Grand Slam of major titles when he goes to Augusta for next month's Masters. That's where the chat is going - will he do it and finally, at long, long last don the famous Green Jacket?\n\"I feel like I'm a better player now than I ever have been,\" he said. \"I feel like I can play all conditions and in anything that comes my way.\"\nMcIlroy beats Spaun in play-off to win Players\nMcIlroy defeats Spaun in play-off to win second Players title - shot by shot\n'Slow progress & slow play lead PGA Tour's agenda'\nThis video can not be played\nIt's the most nervous I've been in a long time - McIlroy\nFirst he must celebrate this win. It was achieved without his very best golf.\nIt would be an exaggeration to say he won it ugly, but he did it with a largely errant driver and was able to put himself in contention in a way that was beyond golf's other leading lights.\nSawgrass is a capricious test at the best of times. Throw in the fierce gusting winds of Saturday, Sunday's four-hour storm delay and the cold breeze of the extra morning, which blew from a completely different direction, and it is the toughest of propositions.\nIt had already been too much for defending champion Scottie Scheffler, likewise Open and US PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, who only scraped into the weekend. It was too much too for Ludwig Aberg, who missed the cut.\nMcIlroy held it together, coming from four behind on the final day to lead by three before being caught by Spaun to force a play-off for which Sunday evening did not hold sufficient daylight.\nYes McIlroy was nervous on Monday. As nervous as he has ever been over a tee shot when the play-off began - but he did not show it. Instead, he striped a majestic drive to tell Spaun unequivocally who was the boss for this shootout.\nThere is an encouraging pragmatism about McIlroy these days. Deciding to abandon erratic new woods three rounds into the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week was an important change of mind.\nThe $1,000 taxi fare to ferry his old woods from his West Palm Beach mansion was money very well spent as he went back to his old set-up for Sawgrass, home of the biggest tournament of the year so far.\nAnd then before the play-off, McIlroy changed his hitting angles to rehearse the nine-iron shot into the wind that he would need for the pivotal second hole of the play-off.\nExperience told in both instances, just as it did when he abandoned big hitting for the final hole at Pebble Beach in February to secure his first PGA Tour title of 2025.\nAnd then came his honest admission of the nerves he was feeling. It is as though he was embracing them rather than allowing them to be the sort of demon that derailed him when he held a winning position at last year's US Open.\n\"I woke up at 03:00 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep,\" he told reporters. \"I was as nervous as I can remember.\"\nWhich is why the opening drive of the play-off was so important. He needed to go out and get the victory.\n\"If you play to win and you've hit an aggressive shot and you've hit a really good shot, I think that can relax you and it can calm your nervous system,\" he said.\n\"If you're playing sort of 'guidey' golf and just trying to not lose, I don't think that sort of golf calms you down.\"\nMcIlroy revealed he felt a turning point after painfully losing last year's Irish Open.  The following week he charged into a play-off at Wentworth and although he lost it to Billy Horschel's eagle in the BMW PGA shoot out there was hope.\nThen he went to the Middle East and ended his season with a crucial victory in the DP World Tour Championship. \"I feel that period, October, November, was a pretty important one,\" he said.\n\"And I was able to do some good work on my swing and then test it out pretty much straight after in a couple of tournaments, and I feel like that's carried into this year.\n\"It doesn't feel like I'm making those mistakes at the critical times like I was previously. I think a big part of that was just learning from those mistakes.\"\nAnd so to carry the momentum to Georgia next month. There will be a stop in Texas prior to the Masters, but already none of his big rivals can boast such an impressive form line heading into the year's first major.\n\"It's about doubling down and working on the things I've been working on,\" McIlroy told BBC Sport. \"And to make sure that I'm 100% ready to go for Augusta.\"",

        "article_text": "A Palestinian student activist, who was detained by US immigration officers earlier this month, has spoken out for the first time about his arrest.\nIn a letter dictated over the phone to his family from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, Mahmoud Khalil said he is a \"political prisoner\" and that he believes he was targeted for \"exercising my right to free speech\".\nBorn in Syria, Mr Khalil is a green card holder and recent graduate of Columbia University. He was a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests on campus in the spring of 2024.\nHis arrest has been linked to President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of \"un-American activity.\"\nTrump has alleged repeatedly that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, group designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest \"the first of many to come\".\nThe day after, Mr Khalil's arrest, Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed the administration's stance, posting on X: \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\nThe 30-year-old's lawyers have argued that he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. They accused the government of \"open repression of student activism and political speech\".\nIn his letter, released Tuesday, Mr Khalil said he believes he was arrested because he \"advocated for a free Palestine\".\nHe also detailed his arrest, saying he and his wife were \"accosted\" on their way home from dinner by Department of Homeland Security agents \"who refused to provide a warrant\".\n\"Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed me and forced me into an unmarked car,\" he said, adding that he was not told anything for hours, including the cause for his arrest.\nMr Khalil said he spent the night at 26 Federal Plaza, a federal office building in New York that includes an immigration court. Later, he was transported to a detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he said he was refused a blanket and forced to sleep on the ground.\nHe was transferred again to a detention facility in Louisiana, where he remains in custody. Mr Khalil's lawyers have been in court since to fight for his release.\nLast week, his lawyers pushed to bring him back to New York and accused the Trump administration of attempting to restrict access to their client. The judge did not issue a ruling at the hearing, but directed prosecutors to prove why the case should take place elsewhere.\nIn his letter, Mr Khalil called his detention \"unjust\" and said it was \"indicative of the anti-Palestinian racism that both the Biden and Trump administrations have demonstrated over the past 16 months.\"\nHe added that both administrations have \"continued to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians and prevented international intervention\". He noted Israel's resumption of air strikes on Gaza on Monday night that killed 400, according to the Hamas-run health authority.\nMr Khalil also took aim at Columbia University's leadership for its disciplining of pro-Palestinian students, saying that the school's actions laid the groundwork for students like him to be targeted.\nColumbia University has stated that law enforcement can enter campus property with a warrant, but the school denied that university leadership had invited ICE agents.\nAmid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.\nAt the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa.\nBack then, he said that he would continue protesting. But more recently, Mr Khalil's wife said her husband had grown worried about deportation, after facing online attacks that \"were simply not based in reality\".\nShe said he sent Columbia University an email asking for urgent legal help on 7 March, the day before immigration agents arrested him. Mr Khalil's wife, who is a US citizen, is now eight months pregnant.\nThe White House has continued to defend its move.\n\"This administration is not going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in our country and then siding with pro-terrorist organisations that have killed Americans,\" said Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary.\nMr Khalil said his story is a warning to others in the US, saying it is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to \"suppress dissent.\"\n\"Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs,\" he warned.",

        "article_text": "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.\nFilm critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.\nIt is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".\nPaste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".\nThere have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".\nBut overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.\nCritics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday. \nIt fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.\n\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.\nSandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".\n\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.\nBad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"\nWhile a critic's job is to a analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.\nThe Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.\nIt also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.\nThe Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.\nThe film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.\nThe streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements. \n\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.\n\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"\nRed Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.\nOther recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.\nBrooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.\nThey are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.\nIn December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".\n\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.\n\"But it does depend on the movie.\"\nNetflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.\nAnother critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.\n\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.\n\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.\n\"And it just feels like really, really bad value for money at that point.\"",

But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

It is not just the breakdown, but there is a physical raw edge to everything they are doing.\n\"It all makes your job so much easier, their back row were unbelievable.\"\nIn this year's Six Nations, England lead the way for turnovers won (36), slowing down their opponents' ruck speed, and jackals won (21).\nThe depth in the back row is only growing after 20-year-old Northampton Saints flanker Henry Pollock scored two tries on his debut, 21-year-old Chandler Cunningham-South also dotted down twice against Wales, while number eight Tom Willis, 26, impressed on his three starts.\nListen: The Six Nations review with Barclay and Warburton\n'Special' Pollock predicted try-scoring Test debut\n'I have not seen that complete an England performance for years'\nThis video can not be played\n'WRU must cut a region to solve Welsh rugby crisis' - Warburton\nWales' match in Italy in round two was their best shot of a victory this campaign but defeat ended Warren Gatland's troubled reign and left interim head coach Matt Sherratt with a tough task to restore pride in his three games in charge.\nHope that they could end their dreadful run of defeats before the end of the championship grew after a much-improved performance against Ireland.\nHowever, the campaign finished with Wales falling to a new low by conceding 68 points against England - the most in their Six Nations history.\nA 17th Test defeat on the bounce was also a record for a tier-one nation in the professional era and condemned Wales to a second successive Wooden Spoon.\nFormer Wales captain Sam Warburton believes now is the time for \"big changes\" and suggests cutting one of the Welsh regions in the United Rugby Championship.\n\"No action is the worst action now,\" he told Six Nations Rugby Special.\n\"Four regions do not work.

        "article_text": "We are surrounded by an invisible killer. One so common that we barely notice it shortening our lives.\nIt's causing heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and studies now even link it to dementia.\nWhat do you think it could be?\nThe answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing.\n\"It is a public health crisis, we've got huge numbers of people exposed in their everyday life,\" says Prof Charlotte Clark, from St George's, University of London.\nIt's just a crisis we don't talk about.\nSo I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world.\nI started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch.\nIt's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats.\nYou can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel.\nThe one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam.\nAnd the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more.\n\"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared.\nOnly the joyful sounds of the playground have a calming effect on my body. The dogs barking and the neighbour's party in the early hours lead to a negative response.\nBut why is sound changing my body?\n\"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark.\nSound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.\nThis is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.\n\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.\nAll of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.\n\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.\nInsidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.\n\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.\nNoise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes \u2013 are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise.\nI meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de Gr\u00e0cia area of Barcelona, Spain.\nThere's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie.\nFrom the balcony you can see the city's famous cathedral, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave.\n\"It's extremely noisy\u2026 it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks.\nShe gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate.\nHer home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\".\nShe has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says.\nIn Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization.\nAcross Europe noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health.\nI meet Dr Foraster at a caf\u00e9 that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here.\nWe can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume.\nThe crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.\n\"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster.\nAnd that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says.\nAlthough it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise.\nDr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend.\n\"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says.\nA loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise.\nThe sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.\nDr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road \u2013 my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels \u2013 and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s.\nBut there is something different about this street \u2013 it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old cross roads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly.\nRemember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body.\n\"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says. My heart rate went down and I stopped sweating.\nThe initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together.\nDr Mueller performed the research projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits.\nBut in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment.\nThe dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities.\nDhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns.\nArtist Momina Raman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem.\nFor about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance.\nHe took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says.\n\"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\"\nBut here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise.\nThere is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.\nShe said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"\nThe solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.\nWhat I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".\nLOUD was produced by Gerry Holt.

        "article_text": "A US federal judge has questioned why the Trump administration failed to obey his order halting the deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members.\nJames Boasberg, the top federal judge in Washington DC, ordered deportation flights to be turned around on Saturday night.\nWhite House officials argued in a court filing that they did not defy the ruling. The argued in part that because Boasberg's order was made orally rather than in written form, it was not enforceable - and that the planes had already left the US by the time it was issued.\nBoasberg has ordered the administration to give further details about the deportations by noon (16:00 GMT) on Tuesday.\nHe has requested further details about the timing of the order under which the deportations occurred, as well as details about the flights themselves.\nDuring a hearing on Monday, Boasberg said he clearly ordered the government to turn the planes around.\n\"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\" he asked Department of Justice lawyers.\nIn the same hearing on Monday, the judge said he would not make another ruling in the case until a hearing scheduled for Friday. \nIn the meantime, government lawyers said that the deportations had been paused. The Trump administration also asked in a court motion that Boasberg be removed from the case.\nThe dispute began over the weekend when a group of 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members, plus 23 alleged members of the international MS-13 gang, were sent from the US to a prison in El Salvador.\nAnnouncing the move on Saturday, Trump accused the gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".\nHe cited the Alien Enemies Act - legislation dating to 1798 that allows non-citizens to be deported in wartime.

The basis on which the other deportees were removed from the US is unclear.\nOn Saturday, during the hearing that took place as several of the deportation flights were in the air, Boasberg ordered a 14-day pause.\nAfter lawyers told the judge that planes with deportees already had taken off, he reportedly gave a verbal order for the flights to turn back \"immediately\", although that directive was not included in a written ruling published shortly thereafter.\nNonetheless, a timeline of events reported by US media suggests the Trump administration had the opportunity to stop at least some of the deportations.\nUnder the US system of checks and balances, government agencies are expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.\nBut Trump's Department of Justice argued, citing case law in a filing on Monday, that \"an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction\".\nAdministration officials also pointed out that the five named plaintiffs in the lawsuit that prompted the hearing were not among those deported, and also argued that once the flights left US airspace, the judge's powers no longer applied.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order.\"\nNeither the US government nor El Salvador has named those who have been deported, or provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.\nSeveral relatives of men believed to be among the group told the New York Times that their loved ones did not have gang ties.\nThe White House, for its part, has insisted that authorities are \"sure\" that the detainees were gang members, based on intelligence.\nTrump's border tsar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump did \"exactly the right thing\".\n\"The plane was already over international waters with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats,\" he said. \n\"We removed terrorists. That should be celebrated in this country.\"\nEl Salvador has agreed to accept the deportees from the US.\nThe country's president, Nayib Bukele, appeared to mock the judge's ruling.\n\"Oopsie\u2026 Too late,\" he posted on social media, along with a picture of a headline announcing the ruling and a 'crying with laughter' emoji.\nHis team also published footage of some of the detainees inside one of its mega-jails.\nAccording to the White House, El Salvador's government received $6m (\u00a34.62m) to take the detainees, which Leavitt said \"is pennies on the dollar\" compared to the cost of holding inmates in US prisons.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which brought the lawsuit leading to the judge's order, questioned Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act, a sweeping wartime authority that allows fast-track deportations.\n\"I think we're in very dangerous territory here in the United States with the invocation of this law,\" said the ACLU's Lee Gelernt.\nThe Alien Enemies Act only allowed deportations when the US was in a declared war with that foreign government, or was being invaded, Mr Gelernt said. \n\"A gang is not invading,\" he told BBC News.\nMaking matters worse was the fact \"the administration is saying nobody can review what they're doing\", Mr Gelernt added.\nAmnesty International USA said the deportations were \"yet another example of the Trump administration's racist targeting\" of Venezuelans \"based on sweeping claims of gang affiliation\".\nVenezuela itself criticised Trump, saying he \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\".\nThe latest deportations under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running campaign against illegal immigration.\nThe two gangs targeted with the weekend deportations were declared \"foreign terrorist organisations\" by Trump after returning to the White House in January.",

        "article_text": "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page, Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It\u2019s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino\u2019s Blue Lagoon is a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay\u2019s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds, protesting what they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n\u2022\u00a0 The summer that tourism fell apart\n\u2022\u00a0 Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of commercial operations at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap \u2013 reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations to combat overtourism. Venice has introduced entry fees for day-trippers, while Athens has capped daily visitor numbers to the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "After Kim Visintine put her son to bed every night at a hospital in St Louis, Missouri, she spent her evening in the hospital\u2019s library. She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old.\n\"Doctors were shocked,\" she says. \"We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs.\"\nKim\u2019s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45. \nZack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old.\nYears later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek.\nIn this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s. \nA compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area. \nThis Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024.\nBenefits were paid to such neighbours, frequently called \"downwinders\", in Arizona, Utah and Nevada, but not New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure.\nSt Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. After World War Two ended, the chemical was dumped near the creek and left uncovered, allowing waste to seep into the area.\nDecades later, federal investigators acknowledged an increased cancer risk for some people who played in the creek as children, but added in their report: \"The predicted increases in the number of cancer cases from exposures are small, and no method exists to link a particular cancer with this exposure.\"\nThe clean-up of the creek is still ongoing and is not expected to finish until 2038.\nA new bill has been put forward in the House, and Josh Hawley, a US senator representing Missouri, says he has raised the issue with President Donald Trump. \nWhen Kim flicks through her school yearbook, she can identify those who have become sick and those who have since passed away. The numbers are startling.\n\"My husband didn\u2019t grow up in this area, and he said to me, 'Kim, this is not normal. It seems like we\u2019re always talking about one of your friends passing away or going to a funeral',\" she says.\nJust streets away from the creek, Karen Nickel grew up spending her days near the water picking berries, or in the nearby park playing baseball. Her brother would often try and catch fish in Coldwater Creek.\n\"I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America,\" says Karen. \"Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night.\"\nBut years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different.\n\"Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers,\" she says. \"We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can\u2019t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this.\"\nWhen Karen\u2019s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen\u2019s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary.\nKaren helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area.\n\"We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure,\" she says. \"These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases.\"\nTeresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases.\nYears later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up. \nThat does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected. \n\"ALS took my sister at 50,\" Teresa says. \"I think it was the worst disease ever of mankind. When she was diagnosed in 2019, she\u2019d just got her career going and her children were growing. She stayed positive through all of it.\"\nLike Hawley, Just STL Moms and other community members want the government's compensation act to be expanded to include people within the St Louis area, despite the programme being in limbo after expiring.\nExpanding it to the Coldwater Creek community would mean that locals could be offered compensation if they could prove they were harmed as a result of the Manhattan Project, during which the atomic bomb was developed with the help of uranium-processing in St Louis. It would also allow screenings and further study into illnesses other than cancer. \nIn a statement to the BBC, the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it took concerns very seriously and had actively worked with federal, state and local partners - as well as community members - to understand their health concerns, and to ensure community members were not exposed to the Manhattan Project-era waste.\nThe BBC has also contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the clean-up - but has not received a response to a request for comment.\n\"My sister would have loved to be part of the fight. She\u2019d be the first to picket,\" says Teresa of her efforts to get greater support from the government.\nThe trend in people around Coldwater Creek getting unwell has not gone unnoticed among healthcare professionals.\nDr Gautum Agarwal, a cancer surgeon at Mercy Hospital in St Louis, says he has not noticed a \"statistical thing\", but notes that he has seen husbands and wives and their neighbours presenting cancers.\nNow, he ensures that his patients are asked where they live and how close they are to Coldwater Creek.\n\"I tell them that there\u2019s a potential that there\u2019s a link. And if your neighbours or family live near there, we should get them screened more often. And maybe you should get your kids screened earlier.\"\nHe hopes that over time more knowledge will be gained about the issue, and for a study into multi-cancer early detection tests to be introduced that could help catch any potential cancers, and help reassure people in the area.\nOther experts take a different view of the risks. \"There is a narrative that many people are sick from cancers, specifically from exposures while living next to Coldwater Creek for the last few decades\", says Roger Lewis, a professor in the environmental and occupations health department of St Louis University. \n\"But the data and studies don't indicate that. They show that there is some risk but it's small. It doesn't mean that it's not significant in some ways, but it's very limited.\" \nProf Lewis acknowledges the fear in the community, saying locals will feel safer if the government is clearer about its efforts  to eliminate any hazards. \nFor many people near Coldwater Creek, conversation with authorities is not easing the angst that comes with living in an area known for the dumping of nuclear waste.\n\"It\u2019s almost a given in our community that at some point we all expect to have some sort of cancer or illness,\u201d says Kim Visintine. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this apathy within our group that, well, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\"\nCorrection 16 March: This article originally reported that the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act covered parts of New Mexico. It has been amended to show that benefits were paid under the act to people in Arizona, Nevada and Utah, but not in New Mexico.",

        "article_text": "A midwife in Texas has been arrested for allegedly providing illegal abortions and operating a network of unlawful clinics in the Houston area.\nMaria Margarita Rojas has been charged with providing an abortion and practising medicine without a licence, according to the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nAuthorities accused Ms Rojas, 48, of operating multiple clinics in Houston where she allegedly performed illegal abortions in her clinic, violating the state's restrictive abortion laws.\nMs Rojas faces second-degree felony charges, which carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $10,000 (\u00a37,700) if convicted.\nUnder the Texas Human Life Protection Act - a 2021 law that bans abortion in most cases - state authorities can also fine Ms Rojas at least $100,000 \"per violation\".\nIn a news release on Monday announcing the arrest, Attorney General Paxton said that \"Texas law protecting life is clear, and we will hold those who violate it accountable\".\n\"I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state's pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individuals endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,\" Paxton said.\nHe added that Texas law holds abortion providers, not patients, \"criminally responsible\" for unlawful procedures.\nIn Texas, physicians are barred from performing an abortion once a foetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks into a pregnancy - before many realise they are pregnant. There are exceptions if the life or health of the pregnant patient is at risk, but not in cases of rape or incest.\nThe state's supreme court unanimously rejected a challenge last year from 20 women who said they were denied medically necessary abortions under Texas law.\nPaxton's office said Ms Rojas, who they allege is known as \"Dr Maria\", operated multiple clinics in north-west Houston.\nShe employed \"unlicensed individuals\" and performed \"illegal abortion procedures\", according to the allegations. \nAuthorities said they have filed a temporary restraining order to shut down the clinics.\nHolly Shearman, a midwife who runs a birth centre where Ms Rojas worked part-time, told the Texas Tribune that she was \"shocked\" by news of the arrest.\nAccording to the Texas-based news website, Ms Shearman said Ms Rojas was a devout Catholic who provided prenatal care to a primarily Spanish-speaking, low-income community. \n\"I don't believe it for one second,\" she said of the allegations.\nMs Rojas' arrest is believed to be one of the first criminal prosecutions under the Texas abortion ban. The state attorney general's office said she was taken into custody in Waller County, and it is unclear if she has a lawyer yet.\nLast year, Paxton's office filed a lawsuit against a New York-based abortion provider for allegedly posting abortion pills to a Texan. That same doctor was indicted earlier this year in the state on a charge of criminal abortion.  \nNew York has shield laws, which aim to protect providers who provide abortion to patients in other states.

        "article_text": "The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never intended to stay for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to be just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected.\u00a0\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stayed for longer.\u00a0\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days\u00a0living aboard the\u00a0American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\nHis time in orbit \u2013 which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days \u2013 was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space \u2013 a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in\u00a0a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is\u00a0expected to take around 1,100 days\u00a0(just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\nMuscles and bones\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\nSimilarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth.\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\nWeight loss\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit \u2013 the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\nEyesight\nOn Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent.\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\nNeural shuffling\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function \u2013 in other words, movement \u2013 and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\nFriendly bacteria\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\nResearchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.)\nSkin\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers \u2013 like Rubio, who spent one year in space \u2013 will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\nThere were also some changes in gene expression \u2013 the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells \u2013 seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system\u00a0was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n* This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

Musk says first mission to Mars will launch next year3 days agoShareSaveSeher AsafBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesSpaceX founder Elon Musk has said his Starship rocket will head to Mars by the end of next year, as the company investigates several recent explosions in flight tests.Human landings could begin as early as 2029 if initial missions go well, though \"2031 was more likely\", he added in a post on his social media platform X. Starship -  the largest rocket ever created standing at 123m -  is crucial to Musk's ambitions to colonise the planet Mars.However it has suffered multiple failures in tests - one of the rockets exploded minutes after it was launched from Texas as part of a test last week, the second failure this year after a similar \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" in January.SpaceX said it would review data \"to better understand [the] root cause\" of the most recent explosion and noted it happened after the loss of \"several\" engines.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the company would be required to conduct an investigation before it could fly again.Nasa hopes to use a modified version of the spaceship as a human lunar lander for its Artemis missions to return to the Moon.ReutersDebris was seen falling from the Bahamas after the rocket exploded last week. In 2024, he said he would launch the first Starships to Mars in 2026, with plans to send crewed flights in four years. The tech billionaire has grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humans to the Moon, and then on to Mars, making humans \"multi-planetary\".Musk has long targeted a trip to Mars.",

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Dublin's Molly Malone statue should be protected to prevent members of the public  from \"violating\" it by groping the sculpture's breasts, a campaigner has said. \nTilly Cripwell pointed out that the bronze artwork has been groped so many times over the years that its breasts have become discoloured. \nThe 23-year-old student said she has witnessed \"disgusting behaviour\" at the statue  many times while busking beside it in recent years. \nDublin City Council has said it is considering the campaigner's call to repair the discoloured statue and raise it on to a higher plinth. \nThe council also confirmed it is in the process of asking tourist companies to deter their customers from touching the statue. \nMs Cripwell said the groping of the sculpture's breasts by passers by and some tourists \"sets a really bad example to younger generations\". \n\"It triggered me so much, I just had to put a stop to it,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"The fact that this icon is immortalised in a statue but reduced to her breasts just seems so wrong.\" \nThe Molly Malone statue was erected 37 years ago in tribute to a legendary Dublin woman who sold shellfish in the streets of the Irish capital. \nIt is not clear if the character is based on a real or fictional person, but the figure of Molly Malone has come to represent part of Dublin's working class community. \nShe was also the subject of a traditional folk song, which tells the story of a fishmongers' daughter who sold cockles and mussels from a wheelbarrow.\nAccording to the colourful lyrics, Molly died of a fever but then returned as a ghost, still wheeling her wheelbarrow through the city's streets.\nMany public artworks in Dublin are popularly referred to by rhyming nicknames and for years, the Molly Malone statue was known as \"the tart with the cart\". \nThis name was in part due to suggestions that Molly Malone worked as a fishmonger by day and as a sex worker by night. \nThe statue was first erected in Dublin's Grafton Street in 1988, created by the renowned bronze sculptor, Jeanne Rynhart.\nIt was later moved to nearby St Andrews' Street to accommodate the construction of a tram line. \nMs Cripwell, who studies at Trinity College in Dublin, accepts that many people think they are doing nothing wrong because \"it's just a statue\".\nBut she said the groping annoys her because the sculpture is \"one of the few representations of women in Irish culture\".\n\"You can imagine the stag dos that come along and it's actually just disgusting behaviour, no matter what kind of object or person you're dealing with.\"\nThe statue is already on a small plinth but Ms Cripwell wants it raised higher to encourage respect and to prevent people clamouring over the statue so easily.\nShe points out that the statues of male figures in Dublin \"are all on high platforms reflecting their status\". \nThe campaigner acknowledged that she is asking for alternations to be made to an artwork that has become a Dublin landmark, but she argued change is necessary. \n\"She already been violated and that's shown in the gold discoloration on her breasts, so the original statue is not the same as it was.\"\nMs Cripwell is also lobbying for the whole sculpture to be repatinated \"so that her breasts aren't a different colour than the rest of her\". \nDublin City Council's spokeswoman told BBC News NI the request for \"repatination and securing the plinth is being considered\" and they are awaiting cost quotations.\n\"A full report will be made to the council's Strategic Policy Committee in April,\" she added. \nAn urban myth has emerged over the years which claims that touching the statue's breasts will somehow bring good luck. \nIt is a myth that has been perpetuated by some tourist companies - a practice that Ms Cripwell wants Dublin City Council to clamp down on. \nOne example of this was still visible on a Spain-based tourism website, Viabam, on Tuesday morning. \nIn a feature about the statue, the website read: \"They say that if you take a photo with her while touching her breasts, you will return to visit the city. \n\"And it seems to work, as it is one of the most sought-after and photographed monuments in Dublin.\"\nWhen contacted by BBC News NI, Viabam's spokesperson said the article was written a couple of years ago and it was \"never our intention to offend anyone\". \n\"We were totally unaware of this campaign and we have absolutely no problem in removing that information,\" they added. \nMs Cripwell said she wants tourist firms to \"actively deter\" their customers from touching the Molly Malone statue.\nBut several tourists - both male and female - were photographed by news agencies as they touched the statue during the St Patrick's Day festival on Monday. \nThe campaigner said the sculpture's \"allegedly busty dress\" was viewed as \"a green card for this behaviour\".\nShe added the practice is also popular at other European tourist sites, including at the statue of Shakespeare's Juliet in Verona.

You don't know what is behind the next door.\"\nTomazs said this outlook on life came from his father and mother passing away from cancer before they both reached the age of 60.\nHe described them as his \"best friends\". \n\"If I have 10 years left of being crazy then I will take it,\" he added.\nTomazs spent five years in London working in the Hippodrome Casino in Leicester Square but felt he \"needed something more from life\" and left TV behind him.\nThat career switch took him away from the glitz and the glamour of casino high-rollers to HMP Pentonville in north London. \nHe worked as a prison officer before he moved back to Nottingham to care for his father after he had been diagnosed with cancer.\nWith his caring duties, he transferred to HMP Nottingham in 2017.\n\"I loved it there, it was an incredible job.

        "article_text": "Stylish and experimental, Breathless heralded a new era of film-making when it was released 65 years ago. In 1964, its director told the BBC why he broke every rule he could.\nJean-Luc Godard was crystal clear about what he planned to do with his feature-length film debut, Breathless (\u00c0 bout de souffle), which was released 65 years ago this month. He wanted to blow up the whole idea of what cinema was. In 1964, the director told the BBC's Olivier Todd: \"It was a film which took everything the cinema had done \u2013 girls, gangsters, cars \u2013 exploded all this and put an end once and for all to the old style.\"\u00a0\nStylish and semi-improvised, Breathless seemed revolutionary when it hit French screens on 16 March 1960. With its fragmented editing, offbeat dialogue and nonchalant approach to storytelling, it helped rewrite the language of modern cinema. As renowned US film critic Roger Ebert wrote: \"No debut film since Citizen Kane in 1942 has been as influential.\"\nOn its surface, Breathless's plot resembles that of a hard-boiled crime thriller. It tells the story of amoral, impulsive petty criminal Michel Poiccard (played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his doomed relationship with the enigmatic Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg), an American journalism student living in Paris. The film's plot plays out as Michel tries to evade arrest after murdering a policeman: he struggles to collect the money necessary to fund his escape and to convince the ambivalent Patricia to flee with him to Italy. But its director was not so much concerned with its crime narrative as he was with shattering cinematic conventions.\u00a0\nBorn in 1930 to wealthy Franco-Swiss parents, Godard had spent the decade preceding Breathless's release immersed in cinema. At the beginning of the 1950s he had begun working as a film critic for the influential French magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. When he started, French cinema was dominated by studio-produced literary adaptations which valued polished storytelling over innovation. Godard, along with his fellow cinephiles at the magazine, railed against these films, arguing that they failed to capture any real emotion or show how people really behaved.\nAt the same time, US films that had been banned during the Nazi occupation were being shown in French cinemas. Following the Second World War, France had signed the Blum-Byrnes agreements which had opened up its markets to US products in return for eradicating its war debt. This led to a flood of US films that were enthusiastically embraced by these young French critics. They especially admired westerns and detective thrillers \u2013 genres they regarded as critically underappreciated. It was Italian-born French film critic Nino Frank who coined the term film noir or dark film. The Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma writers also revered film-makers who could stamp their own unique creative visions onto Hollywood productions, such as Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. They regarded these directors as the true \"auteurs\" or authors of those films, rather than the studio which produced them or the stars who appeared in them.\nThroughout the 1950s, these critics would debate and discuss the shortcomings of French cinema while developing their own ideas of what it should be. Many of the writers Godard worked alongside at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, such as Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, \u00c9ric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol, would also end up becoming directors and leading proponents of the influential movement that would become known as La Nouvelle Vague (The New Wave).\u00a0\nWith Breathless, Godard saw his chance to put the ideas he and his friends discussed into practice. He explained to the BBC in 1964 that he purposely set out to break rules he felt were holding back cinema. \"Conventions were exploded to make something with the remains, just as the debris is collected after an explosion. And when there is nothing useful left, we can start from scratch on fresh ground,\" he said.\nThe film's story was written by Truffaut, who based it loosely on a 1952 news article about a Paris criminal, Michel Portail. However, when Godard came to filming, he would pretty much abandon Truffaut's script. Instead, he got his actors to improvise scenes, or he would feed them lines from behind the camera while filming. This gave the dialogue a spontaneous and personal feel. But it meant that much of Breathless needed to be shot sequentially, so Belmondo and Seberg would know what had happened earlier in the story.\nDue to its limited budget, Godard's plan was to make the cheapest film possible. So instead of shooting in a studio where he would be able to control the lighting, the sound and the set, he took to the streets of Paris with his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, who filmed on location using a lightweight handheld camera and relying on natural light. The camera, while portable and effective at filming in low-light conditions, was both noisy and unable to record synchronised sound. This meant that nearly all of the improvised lines of dialogue needed to be written down as Belmondo and Seberg ad-libbed, and then dubbed in post-production. This resulted in the later recorded dialogue often not matching the actors' lips, leading to debates that continue to this day about what the characters are actually saying.\nBecause much of Breathless's guerilla-style filming was done without permits or permission, random people going about their everyday lives in Paris's bustling streets and cafes were often captured in shot, lending an authenticity to its depiction of life in the city. Coutard had been a war photographer, and his reportage style of filming captured an immediacy and intimacy that made the film seem, at times, documentary-like. His camera moves restlessly around, capturing small everyday moments as the characters meet, talk and hang out. Sometimes the camera almost seems to be a participant in the action, sitting in the passenger seat of the car Michel has just stolen while he talks to it as if it were a friend. Breathless's lack of a conventional film crew added to its inventiveness. One of its most famous scenes, where Michel and Patricia are seen walking down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es chatting as she advertises a newspaper, was achieved by Godard pulling Coutard along in a wheelchair while he filmed the actors walking towards him.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\n\"The freedom of shooting on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Jean Seberg walking down the curb with her unforgettable chanting, 'New York Herald Tribune'. It was like the invention of a mythology for me,\" the Italian director of Last Tango in Paris and The Last Emperor, Bernardo Bertolucci, told the BBC's The Film Programme in 2009.\nBut Godard wasn't trying to convince audiences that they were seeing unfiltered reality. He had been influenced by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, who believed that a story could so absorb an audience that they became passive and unthinking. So, to keep viewers critically engaged, Brecht would remind them that they were watching a play and not real life.\nGodard embraced this idea, using a range of stylistic devices to make it impossible for viewers to forget that they were watching a film. Characters regularly break the fourth wall, addressing their dialogue directly to the audience. Often, they comment on their own situation, shaking the viewer's feeling of being an unseen spectator. And while a typical film's soundtrack subtly suggests the mood of a scene, in Breathless the music starts and stops suddenly, often disconnected from what is happening on screen at the time.\u00a0\nBut it was Godard's rejection of the usual cinematic editing rules that would become the signature of the film. \"I was incredibly passionate about the style, the language of \u00c0 bout de souffle,\" Bertolucci told the BBC. \"There were these jump cuts, for example. At school they were always telling you how to avoid jump cuts which were considered mistakes, and the movie was full of jump cuts.\"\nBreathless's use of jump cuts \u2013 abrupt transitions forward in time within the same scene \u2013 came about partly by accident. The finished film turned out to be much longer than intended, and Godard needed a way to cut it down to a manageable length. But instead of dropping whole scenes or sequences, the director chose to condense its running time by cutting out sections within takes. Often, he removes material from a continuous shot of movement or dialogue while making no attempt to match the edits, breaking the viewer's immersion in the film and giving it an energetic, skittish rhythm.\nThis jittery editing style lent Breathless a feeling of unpredictability, grabbing the audience's attention and forcing them to be aware of the film-making process. Godard also did this by referencing other films, while at the same time subverting the very conventions that make those films work. Otto Preminger's 1950 film noir thriller Whirlpool is playing when Patricia enters a cinema in an effort to lose the police trailing her. In another scene, when she looks through a rolled-up poster at Michel, the shot mimics a scene in the western Forty Guns (1957) which is seen through a gun barrel. The admired French director of gangster films, Jean-Pierre Melville, has a cameo appearance playing a fictional celebrity author, while Godard himself crops up as a bystander on the street who recognises the fugitive Michel from the newspaper articles.\u00a0\nIn another homage to Godard's influences, the protagonist, Michel, dresses like his hero Humphrey Bogart and practises trying to emulate his onscreen mannerisms. At one point, while gazing at the poster for Bogart's last film, The Harder They Fall (1956), he whispers \"Bogey\" in admiration. But Michel's behaviour, unlike that of a Bogart hero, comes across as neither heroic nor courageous. He displays no conscience over his crimes or remorse over his actions. His girlfriend, Patricia, who goes on to betray him to the police, could be seen as a classic femme fatale character, but instead of being driven by passion, their relationship seems oddly detached and her motives remain opaque. The meaning in Breathless is never simply spelt out for its audience, and its freewheeling plot and morally ambiguous characters provide no easy answers. The film leaves it to the viewer to come to their own interpretations and judgements.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How Easy Rider revolutionised Hollywood\n\u2022\u00a0The classic western that made Clint Eastwood a star\n\u2022\u00a0The cult erotic film that became a global hit\nWith its distinctive storytelling, imaginative camerawork and photogenic young leads, who imbued it with an effortless sense of cool, Breathless was an immediate critical and commercial hit. It seemed to capture the mood of the times and people flocked to see it. \"They were in a sense ready for it,\" Professor James Williams told Kirsty Lang on the BBC's Last Word in 2022. \"I mean, people wanted something new and different.\" It would go on to win Godard the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 1960 Berlin International Film Festival.\nFor the aspiring directors who saw Breathless, its effect was electric. \"As a potential film-maker, it was like just being free, it was like being on a drug or something. It was just amazing,\" Get Carter's director Mike Hodges told the BBC's The Film Programme in 2006.\n\"It broke all the rules \u2013 and rules of film-making are quite frightening in many ways. You've got to get the angles right, and you have lines that you don't cross. This was in the classical tradition. So in a sense, cinema was very like the classical painters, whereas when you saw Godard's film, it was like the impressionists coming to life, but on the screen.\"\nBreathless's impact would be felt in many of the US films that followed its release, with Godard influencing the Hollywood studios that had so affected him. Breathless's characters' moral ambiguity and its abrupt shifts in tone could be seen in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), its innovative camera angles and examination of relationship uncertainty were reflected in The Graduate (1967), and its low-budget filming techniques and improvised dialogue were embraced in Easy Rider (1969).\u00a0\nIn the 1970s, a slew of young directors inspired by the French New Wave, such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, would put their own singular \"auteur\" visions of cinema on the screen. The director Quentin Tarantino, who named his production company A Band Apart, after Godard's 1964 film Bande \u00e0 part, has long acknowledged the effect the director had on him. He told Film Comment in a 1994 interview that \"Godard did to movies what Bob Dylan did to music: they both revolutionised their forms\".\nPart of Breathless's continuing influence on film-makers is in persuading them that it is possible for the viewer to do just what Godard did. As Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright wrote after Godard died in 2022: \"It was ironic that he himself revered the Hollywood studio film-making system, as perhaps no other director inspired as many people to just pick up a camera and start shooting.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In Japan, a smelly waste product is being reimagined as a potential clean fuel of the future that is powering cars and tractors.\nWe're being eyed suspiciously by dozens of cows. Their breath fogs cartoonishly from their nostrils.\nIt's a brisk morning in snowy Hokkaido, an island in the north of Japan. The cold air carries the distinct scent of cow manure \u2013 a smelly yet familiar side-effect of the region's thriving dairy industry. Accounting for 20% of the country's landmass, this island is the second-largest in Japan. It's also home to over a million cows, which produce over half of the country's milk and dairy products.\nWe are visiting one farm in Hokkaido that wants to transform the source of the pungent aroma in the air into something valuable. They are turning cattle manure into hydrogen.\u00a0\nWhen it is burned, hydrogen does not emit carbon, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. There are widespread hopes it could be used as a sustainable fuel to heat homes and power cars, trains, aircraft and ships in the future.\nBut the most common way of producing hydrogen today involves using methane \u2013 a fossil fuel piped up from deep underground, meaning it is still associated with significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.\nThe Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source \u2013 a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. Around 20 million tonnes of cow manure is generated in Hokkaido annually. If not treated correctly, it can be an environmental burden, producing significant methane emissions as well as affecting water quality if allowed to leak into streams and rivers. So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?\n\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. We are visiting the facility in Shikaoi, a town in central Hokkaido, to film an upcoming episode of the BBC's TechXplore focusing on Japan. \"Shikaoi accounts for 30% of Hokkaido\u2019s cow waste and urine, so it has great potential for renewable energy.\"\nLaunched in 2015 by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, the project aims to convert agricultural by-products into hydrogen to supply the local, rural community in a circular economy.\u00a0The cow excrement and urine is collected from local dairy farms before being fed into a anaerobic digester at a central facility. Here bacteria break down the organic waste to produce biogas and a liquid fertiliser. The biogas is then purified into methane that is used to manufacture hydrogen.\nThe plant now has a hydrogen production capacity of 70 cubic metres (18,500 gallons), with an onsite fuelling station that can fill around 28 vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells per day, says Abe. Although the fuel can be used by cars with fuel cells, the plant's fuelling station has been specially designed to accommodate agricultural vehicles such as tractors and forklift trucks. These farm vehicles are difficult to electrify with batteries due to their size and the type of work they do. The hydrogen-powered vehicles are used around the farms' sites, reducing the emissions that would otherwise be created by using other fuel sources.\u00a0\nCattle-made-hydrogen is also stored in canisters that are transported to provide power and heat to other facilities in the area, including a local sturgeon fish farm and the nearby Obihiro Zoo.\nBut hydrogen isn't without its problems. It needs to be stored in high-pressure tanks as a gas, and can be prone to leakage due to its low molecular weight. It can also degrade metal storage containers, leaving them embrittled, and is easily ignited and so requires additional safety precautions when handling it.\nHydrogen can also be stored as a liquid by chilling it to cryogenic temperatures of below \u2013253C (-423F), but this can be energy intensive and requires large amounts of additional infrastructure.\nHydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of petrol (gasoline) when taken by mass alone. But its low molecular weight also means that by volume, the energy packed into a litre of liquid hydrogen is a quarter that of petrol. Put simply, as the lightest gas in the Universe, hydrogen takes up more space kilogram for kilogram than petrol. This means a lot more storage space is needed for hydrogen compared to fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and natural gas. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.\nBut as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.\nHokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.\nUsing agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses\u00a0the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Here, steam heated to 800C (1,472F) reacts with the methane to produce hydrogen, along with the byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO2).\u00a0\nIn the case of cow manure, however, says Abe, the project remains sustainable as this carbon originated in the grass the cows grazed on: \"Since it was originally in the atmosphere, it is considered carbon neutral.\"\nIn addition, it helps to prevent the methane that would otherwise have been emitted from the manure from getting into the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas.\nLeftover slurry from the manure after the biogas has been extracted is sprayed as fertiliser onto nearby fields, while formic acid \u2013 which is both used in and created by the processes \u2013 could be offered as a preservative for cattle feed, says Abe.\u00a0\nCurrently, the electricity needed to produce and store the hydrogen comes from the national grid. But Abe says there's potential to shift to green energy, given Hokkaido\u2019s promising sea, wind and geothermal potential, thus reducing the carbon emissions of this electricity.\nStill, other challenges remain. The high cost of the hydrogen compared to fossil fuels and low demand mean expanding the operation is difficult.\u00a0\n\"The construction costs of hydrogen stations are very high,\" says Abe. \"Since hydrogen vehicles are not yet widespread, we're keeping our filling capacity low to manage initial investment. As adoption increases, we'll expand supply.\"\nTo encourage hydrogen vehicle adoption in the area, hydrogen prices are subsidised by the plant, matching the cost of petrol. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.\nHype Meter\nThe process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure. With other countries exploring how to use other types of waste, from pig dung to coconut husks, to produce hydrogen using similar processes, it appears this could be a model adaptable to other local contexts.\nWith the scale still small, however, and costs of production high, it remains to be seen how widespread this industry can be. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen.\u00a0\nJapan is the world leader in hydrogen vehicles and has invested considerably in developing the technology. But for now battery-powered electric vehicles remain cheaper than hydrogen powered ones.\nThough it's unlikely that cow manure alone will ever meet Japan's hydrogen demand, it could contribute significantly, and Shikaoi is creating a model for a circular economy that it hopes will show how costs can fall with the economies of scale.\u00a0\nAnd there is growing interest in other parts of the world in using waste materials to produce hydrogen, with pig dung, poultry waste and even coconut husks having been explored as potential feedstocks. In Thailand, vehicle manufacturer Toyota is even exploring the use of hydrogen made from chicken waste to fuel its vehicles.\nMeanwhile, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago in the US recently developed another promising method to make hydrogen involving manure. In their case, they used the manure, along with sugarcane waste and corn husks, to make biochar, a carbon-rich substance which vastly reduces the amount of electricity needed to convert water to hydrogen.\n\"We are the first group to show that you can produce hydrogen utilising biomass at a fraction of a volt,\" says Meenesh Singh, a chemical engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago who led the project.\nIn the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, on Kyushu, meanwhile, another waste product is being used to produce hydrogen \u2013 and here the dung is from humans.\nFor more than a decade, hydrogen has been created at the city's sewage treatment plant for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Most recently it has been used to fuel a fleet of zero-emission rubbish trucks.\nAkira Miyaoka, hydrogen utilisation manager for Fukuoka City, says trucks that transport daily products are the town's main source of CO2, rather than large factories as in many other cities. \"So we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from commercial trucks,\" she says.\nThe initiative started as a collaboration between Kyushu University and Fukuoka City, but now involves several major companies including Toyota.\n\"Sewage is something that is steadily discharged every day in the daily lives of citizens, so by making effective use of that sewage and extracting hydrogen as energy, we can achieve local production and local consumption of energy,\" says Miyaoka.\u00a0\nGenerating hydrogen from human waste starts with water from various household sources \u2013 including showers, dishwashers and toilets \u2013 arriving at the treatment plant. As the water is cleaned, the residual sludge is kept as a source of biogas and converted into hydrogen.\u00a0\n\"Sewage and biogas contain various impurities, so the process begins with the process of removing those impurities, which I think is a little different from other hydrogen production processes,\" says Miyaoka.\nIn 2024, Toyota helped the city launch Japan\u2019s first hydrogen-powered service vehicle fleet, including ambulances, delivery vans and bin trucks. Officials at the sewage treatment plant say it is capable of producing 300kg (661lbs) of hydrogen in 12 hours \u2013 enough to fuel 30 trucks.\u00a0\nThe rubbish trucks head out six nights each week, each collecting 1.7 tonnes (3,700lb) of rubbish, all while running silently and emission-free on the bodily waste of the people they are collecting other waste from.\nFukuoka's sewage-to-hydrogen fuelling station has been around since 2015, and several other countries around the world are now adopting a similar approach.\nConcord Blue has developed waste-to-energy plants in Germany, India, Japan and the US, converting waste and biomass into hydrogen and bioenergy. Several water authorities in the UK are also working on projects to derive hydrogen from sewage.\nA prototype race car has also been developed using sewage-derived hydrogen in the UK. The Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), in partnership with Severn Trent Water, is harnessing microbes that generate hydrogen fuel from waste. They anticipate the technology could hit the mainstream within five years, despite existing challenges. (Read about how sewage-powered cars could be the future of motorsport.)\nOn a larger scale, aviation accounts for 2% of global carbon emissions, and researchers in a UK lab have developed jet fuel made entirely from human sewage.\nStill, despite the promise, all of these technologies have yet to be delivered at significant scale.\nWhether in rural or city landscapes, the Japanese projects we've seen during in filming are inspiring because they have the local community at their heart.\nWhile adoption of hydrogen cars has stalled, hydrogen truck adoption is increasing gradually and it is these larger heavier industrial vehicles that contribute most significantly per vehicle to greenhouse gas emissions.\nBy reimagining waste as a resource, these projects demonstrate that energy can be found in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Paul Carter is the presenter of TechXplore.

Forty-four people, including a child, lost their lives to a cornstarch-based explosion in 1919 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which levelled part of the town. \"The main explosion seemed to lift great buildings and hold them in tension for a moment, letting them drop with their own weight,\" one observer wrote later.\nDust explosions, of various substances, have continued to take lives \u2013 in 2014, 97 people died when dust in a factory in Kunshan, China, ignited. In 2022, one industry report counted 50 such explosions globally, although not all of them involved foodstuffs.\nHow can the makings for a simple dessert cause carnage, though? In all dust explosions, there are a few common factors. The powder must be made of a flammable substance \u2013 that means you're safe from sand, which is made of minerals like silica. But flour, cornstarch, sugar, coal dust, powdered plastic, and aluminium powder can all burn, meaning that if they get airborne, the risk for a truly devastating explosion goes up.\nThat's because, suspended in a cloud, all those particles have an enormous surface area exposed to oxygen. That makes them swift to combust. If a few of them heat up to ignition \u2013 and in each of these cases, there was a source of heat like friction or static electricity involved \u2013 then the fire can spread almost instantaneously to the rest of the cloud. Like a pile of confetti ignited in a fireplace, suspended dust burns fast.\nThat evening at the Bird's Custard factory, there were 20 workers on duty. Several noticed that cornstarch was pouring out of the top of one of the bins, according to the accident report. \"At this point several witnesses saw a flash near the top of the bin and a wall of flame spreading outwards and downwards from the bin top,\" the report continues. \"Descriptions were of a gale-force wind with a flame front behind, which flashed through the area.\" Later inspection revealed that the machinery meant to pour cornstarch into various bins had malfunctioned, so cornstarch continued to pour into the container until it overflowed.\u00a0\u00a0\nKeeping the risk of such explosions down means coming at the problem from many angles \u2013 grounding all the machines in a factory to reduce static electricity, building in filtration systems that remove dust from the air, and diligent patrolling for any dust build-up are all recommended by health and safety agencies.\nLook at a spoonful of cornstarch or custard powder, and it is nearly impossible to imagine it as an engine of destruction. Very few of us have any direct experience of these events, so it is hard to see these substances the way you might see a sheet of paper held near a candle, or a cigarette smouldering by a pile of leaves, as an accident waiting to happen.\u00a0\nThere are situations in which you might encounter this dangerous chemistry in real life, however, outside of a custard factory or flour silo.\nParties in which coloured powder, often cornstarch, is shot into crowds, inspired by the Hindu festival of Holi, are popular spring-time events. In 2015, at a water park in Taiwan, coloured cornstarch sprayed over a concert audience ignited, provoking a maelstrom in which more than 500 people were injured. Twenty people died as a result of their injuries.\nMore like this\n\u2022\u00a0The odd-tasting oil that packed a healthy punch\n\u2022\u00a0What we owe the humble lentil\n\u2022\u00a0Gelatine: the ingredient with the wonder wobble\nThe park's management stated that they had no knowledge that such explosive fires were possible as a result of cornstarch clouds. In fact, coloured powders are often sold with labels incorrectly marking them as non-flammable, a team of scientists found in 2023 when they tested the combustible qualities of various powders.\nAt Bird's Custard, that day in 1981, the wall of flame thankfully did not kick up any dust that could have provoked a secondary explosion. But it's not uncommon for dust explosions to go from bad to worse as lingering dust is kicked up and rises into the air. The only way to prevent these disasters is to pre-empt them, say consultants who assess the risks for companies.\nKeep spaces where powders are used clean, patrol for sources of heat and, above all, have a healthy respect for the destructive potential in innocent, edible powder like custard.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "In 2019, climate scientist Steffen Olsen took a startling photo of huskies appearing to walk on water. The photo quickly went viral as it revealed the reality of Greenland's rapidly melting ice.\nIn June 2019, a striking image of husky dogs apparently walking on water in Greenland stunned the world and quickly went viral.\nThe photo was taken by Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute and lead of Blue Action, a European project which investigates the effect of a changing Arctic on weather and climate.\n\"The reaction surprised me,\" says Olsen. \"It surprised me that so many people saw this as a beautiful photo. I saw it as a scary situation.\"\nThat's because the dogs were in fact wading through ankle-deep meltwater on top of sea ice in Inglefield Bredning, an 80km-long (49.7 miles) system in northwestern Greenland.\n\"I learned to see the photo as an illusion. People don't see sea ice, but dogs walking on water,\" Olsen says.\u00a0\nOlsen captured the photo while travelling with a team of scientists who were monitoring sea and ice conditions near the town of Qaanaaq, one of the world's most northerly towns. They were retrieving scientific instruments they had deployed during the winter.\u00a0\n\"We had been travelling for some hours and it became clear that the melting was very extreme\u2026 [the ice] more or less melted beneath our feet while we were travelling on it,\" says Olsen. \"The local hunters and I were very surprised\u2026 we were searching for dry spots to get the dogs and the sleds out of the water and there were none in sight. We turned around and made it back to the coast.\"\nThe dogs are typically very hesitant to get their paws wet, says Olsen. \"Usually when we meet water, it's because there are cracks in the sea ice and the dogs have to jump over the water\u2026they hate it. But it was actually very warm so I think they were happy to have cold feet,\" he says, adding that temperatures reached 14C (57F) on the day.\nThe scientists managed to retrieve their instruments a few days later once the water had drained away through small cracks in the ice sheet. \"Then you have a short period of time when you can then travel again before the ice collapses and breaks up,\" says Olsen.\nOlsen says he was extremely surprised by the rapid melting he witnessed when he took the photo on 13 June 2019. He has only experienced such an extreme event once during his 15 years carrying out research in Greenland. It's unusual for melting to occur that quickly, Olsen explains.\n\"It requires a sudden onset of warm air while you still have fresh snow on the ice and solid sea ice. So it's an example of an extreme event developing early in the season... The local community have told me: 'you will have to wait 100 years to see [such an event] again'.\"\u00a0\nMelting events such as the one Olsen witnessed would normally not occur until later in the season, in late June and July, but in 2019 melting started in mid-April, around six to eight weeks before the 1981-2020 average, and affected roughly 95% of Greenland's ice sheet, according to the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSuch early melting events can have a \"snowball effect\" and lead to more melting as there is less snow and ice to reflect the Sun's rays back into space and keep the surface cool, explains Bianca Perren, a paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who studies sediment cores from polar regions to understand the long-term variability of the climate.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Antarctica's upside-down ice-scape we had no idea existed\n\u2022\u00a0The 'mind bomb' photos that changed the whaling industry\n\u2022\u00a0Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\nGreenland experienced record ice loss in 2019, shedding a total of 532 billion tonnes from its giant ice sheet, according to a 2020 study. On average, Greenland loses 234 billion tonnes of ice per year\u00a0\u2013 enough to pack into 6,324 Empire State Buildings.\n\"2019 was a really unusually warm year, but so was 2012,\" says Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist at BAS who studies the impacts of Greenland's melting ice sheet. In 2012, the summer period (June-August) was more than 2C (4F) warmer than the average for 1981-2010, and more than 1.5C (3F) warmer for the entire ice sheet. \"Those extremes are coming round more frequently than we had thought they would. They're happening every few years,\" says Hogan.\n\"What's really distinctive about Greenland is how much melting you get on the surface in the summer, because you don't get anywhere near as much as that in Antarctica,\" says Hogan. \"When you see huge volumes of water [on the ice], it is really shocking.\"\nBut it's rare to see \"giant pools of water\" on the surface like in Olsen's photo, says Perren, as usually the water seeps through cracks in the ice. \"It basically pops the ice sheet up and floats it out to the coast. So often you don't have this pooling of water, but instead you have warm water that's being sent down into the bowels of the Greenland ice sheet, basically warming the whole thing,\" she says.\nThe rapid melting of the ice is already affecting local communities' way of life. \"They are having to adapt the way they hunt and fish,\" says Olsen.\nIf the ice is unsafe to travel on, it also makes it more difficult for scientists to carry out their research, Olsen adds. \"We will have to adapt and rely more on automatic instruments instead of community-based monitoring.\"\u00a0\nSafety is already a concern, says Perren, adding: \"I have promised my son that I will not step foot on the ice sheet because it's so dangerous.\"\nThe photo has helped raise awareness of Greenland's vulnerability to climate change, says Olsen. \"I have definitely found that you can get a lot of attention for the problem with a photo\u2026 so it has been very efficient.\n\"But I've also been challenged by people saying: 'how can you take a photo of climate change?' And I agree, you cannot take one photo and call it climate change, because that is something that unfolds over a longer time period,\" says Olsen. \"We need to explain the photo and provide the right context.\"\nPhotos are useful tools for starting conversation about the environment and explaining scientific phenomena, says Perren. \"Science has a communication problem,\" she says.\n\"When I first saw it in 2019 I remember thinking: 'oh my gosh, this is such a shocking image,'\" adds Perren. \"It's a symbolic image of what climate change looks like in Greenland. But there's also a scientific side to it: maybe this is unprecedented but it also [paints] a very good, kind of emblematic picture of what the future would look like.\"\nHogan says that photo \"really drives home the extent of the problem\". \"It looks like the dogs are skating on something without a bottom\u2026 it feels like they could just sink at any moment, which is maybe some sort of metaphor for the ice sheet and the future.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Lewis Hamilton is starting his 19th season in Formula 1\nAustralian Grand Prix\nVenue: Albert Park, Melbourne Date: Sunday, 16 March Race start: 04:00 GMT\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 03:30. Live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nThere was no fairytale for Lewis Hamilton on his first competitive outing for Ferrari, as Formula 1's most celebrated driver began his career with the sport's most iconic team.\nThe seven-time world champion qualified only eighth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - one place and 0.218 seconds slower than his team-mate Charles Leclerc, and a whopping 0.877secs behind Lando Norris' McLaren on pole position.\nAfterwards, Hamilton was repeating the mantra he has been using for some time - that it is going to take a little time before he is fully up to speed with his new car and team.\n\"For me, just improving every single lap, session on session,\" he said. \"Big learning curve this weekend.\n\"The car was so much different than I have ever experienced here and it's been a lot slower process to build confidence in the car.\n\"In the high-speed [corners], I have been down all weekend to Charles, who has had confidence from the get-go. He knew what the car does. I was just building up to that. I got a lot closer in the end and to be that close to Charles in my first qualifying session against a great qualifier...\"\nNorris takes Melbourne pole with Hamilton eighth\nAustralian Grand Prix Qualifying Review\nHe didn't complete the sentence, but the meaning was clear - Leclerc is blindingly fast; everyone knows that. So from Hamilton's point of view, in terms of his own relative performance, this was a perfectly decent start.\nThe same could not be said of Ferrari themselves. Hamilton is at Ferrari with one objective only - to win an eighth world title. Leclerc himself spoke on Thursday about winning a championship with Ferrari being his \"obsession\". Neither will achieve their aims with a car that qualifies on the fourth row of the grid.\nLeclerc was perplexed by what had happened. He had been quick all weekend, and fourth fastest in the first qualifying session, just over 0.1secs off Norris, who topped all three. But it became progressively worse as the hour developed.\n\"As soon as we started to push the car more and more,\" Leclerc said, \"we found more and more inconsistency, which was a bit of a shame.\n\"We lost the pace a little bit through qualifying. In Q1 we were good, in Q2 we were less good and in Q3 we had to push a lot to try and nail the lap time. We didn't really follow the track for some reason.\n\"This car has a lot of potential but for now we don't seem to be in the right window, so we have to find it.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBig surprises & how will Hamilton do?: BBC 5 Live team share 2025 predictions\nIt was a sobering start to a season that all in F1 had expected to start with Ferrari as McLaren's closest challenger. But not everyone felt it was necessarily a reflection of the team's true potential.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"I am certainly surprised at the gap between McLaren and Ferrari. But I would say more, I just don't take that gap at face value.\n\"I'm sure the potential of the red car is higher than for some reasons was possible to exploit today. I think we have seen that until possibly qualifying in every single session, even in Bahrain [at pre-season testing].\n\"So we are very realistic that Ferrari is definitely one of the main contenders.\"\nLando Norris has spent his entire F1 career with McLaren since making his debut in 2019\nHamilton at Ferrari - his personal quest for success, and the internal battle with Leclerc - is one of the dominant narratives at the start of this season.\nAnother is whether Norris can deliver on his ambition to mount a season-long title challenge from the off, rather than having to play catch-up - which he had to try to do last year because McLaren did not start on Red Bull's level.\nIn the end in Melbourne, McLaren did deliver on their potential, but not without a few scary moments.\nFacing a tougher challenge from Red Bull and Max Verstappen than they - and the four-time champion himself - had expected, Norris and Oscar Piastri both made mistakes on their first laps in the final part of qualifying.\nThat put them under pressure on their last runs - lacking a competitive first lap always makes finding the right balance of risk and reward on that all-important final lap much more difficult, because the penalty of making a mistake is so much greater.\nFor home favourite Piastri, this was bad enough - he was fourth after his first run. Norris, though, was 10th, having had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits.\nBoth absolutely nailed it. Piastri, hoping to become the first Australian to win his home grand prix in F1, improved by a second, knocking Verstappen from the top, and Norris did even better, pipping his team-mate by 0.084secs.\nNorris said. \"It's a track where you've got to commit. You know what your target is, and once you turn in you're kind of hoping for the best in a lot of cases. You want to take those risks.\n\"Obviously, I took too many on my first lap and got track limits, so I was in a difficult position knowing how much risk I wanted to take. But I put it together well. It was just a clean lap, no mistakes, and that was enough. So happy. A perfect way to start the season.\"\nMcLaren ended last year with their first constructors' championship title for 26 years, and Stella has said they have taken some risks with \"innovative\" design in pushing for more performance from a car that was the fastest in the field for the second half of last year.\nAlthough all the teams arrived in Melbourne expecting them to be at the front, Norris on Thursday described the idea they might be a chunk ahead of the rest as \"short-sighted\".\nIn the end, at least on the quick, demanding street circuit of Albert Park, he was the one who had to recalibrate.\n\"It really was not necessarily our expectation to have a bit of a gap to the rest of the cars,\" Norris said, before pointing to the fact that the errors they made were due to the difficulty in nailing a lap in a car that has taken the team to new heights.\n\"The car is extremely quick. And when you put it together, it's unbelievable. It's just difficult to put it together. So really it was like a little fight between me and Oscar today, and it was a tough one.\"\nMax Verstappen retired with a brake failure after just four laps of last year's race in Melbourne\nVerstappen might have been pleasantly surprised to be best of the rest, but the 0.385secs margin between him and Norris, while perhaps expected, will have been less palatable.\nFor his team, though, there are concerns on more than one level. On top of the apparent gap to McLaren, there was the performance of their new recruit Liam Lawson.\nAfter paying off Sergio Perez to leave just seven months after being given a new two-year contract, the last thing Red Bull will have wanted to see was Lawson more than 0.6secs off Verstappen on the first day's practice.\nLawson was then hit with an engine problem that robbed him of the entire final session on Saturday. In that context, it was no surprise that he should struggle in qualifying.\nEven so, a first lap a second off Verstappen, and a mistake on his second - putting him on to the grass and down in 18th on the grid - was not a good start.\nLawson is two places behind 18-year-old Italian Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Hamilton's replacement at Mercedes. Antonelli, who will become the third youngest driver to start an F1 race on Sunday, had his qualifying compromised by damage to the floor of his car. The other Mercedes of George Russell will start alongside Verstappen in fourth.\nThere was an impressive performance from another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto in the Sauber, a bad start to his first full season for Haas' British novice Oliver Bearman, and promise from Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin that was not delivered when an off in the second session damaged his floor.\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nMany would want a straightforward first race of the season. But Albert Park has a habit of throwing up curveballs, and it seems the weather may oblige on Sunday, with rain predicted.\n\"It's a new car,\" Norris said. \"So there are a lot of unknowns and question marks about how it will perform. It's not always as simple as just putting on wets and having a crack.\n\"A bit of our pace potentially goes out of the window because it's harder to extract and show the difference of pace we had today. But we're in the best position to do that if we can. I know the chances of rain have been going down, but normally wet races and inter races are pretty exciting.\"\nWhat he did not mention is that the rain brings Verstappen - who would not expect to match the McLarens in a dry race - right into the picture.\nStella was less reticent.\n\"The only thing I can say about Max in the wet is that he is mega,\" he said. \"He can be a significant threat.\"\nHamilton, too, has made a reputation for being special when it rains. But his circumstances mean he will not be treating it with the usual smile.\n\"The wet has often been something I have enjoyed,\" Hamilton said. \"So it's a comfort zone for me but I am going out for the first time in the wet in an uncomfortable position because I have never driven this car.\n\"It is going to be a shock to the system when I first get out there, but I will be learning on the fly and giving it everything.\"\nBritish driver Nigel Mansell won his first race for Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nFrance thrash Scotland to become Six Nations champions\nHalf an hour played in Paris and things are a little testy. \nFrance's discipline is rank. They've had two men in the bin. Peato Mauvaka somehow escapes a full red for a diving headbutt on Ben White. And Darcy Graham has just scored. \nIt's 13-10 to the championship-chasers, but it's stressed.\nThe stadium cameras pick out Antoine Dupont in the crowd and the place erupts. To these people, it's like an apparition. God is with us, so have faith.\nApart from the cacophony that greeted the tries that came in a dominant second half, the roars for Dupont - in that moment of need and again later as he lifted the trophy with the stand-in captain Gregory Alldritt - were the loudest of the night.\nAnd what a night. What an era they might be entering. As the fireworks crackled, the tinsel fell and the lap of honour snaked around the vast stadium, it felt like the beginning of something. \nFrance overpower Scotland to win Six Nations title\nFrance's Bielle-Biarrey breaks Six Nations try record\nHow final day unfolded as France win Six Nations\nTo say that French rugby is in rude order is putting it mildly.\nFirst, a moment of reflection. Saturday was not the time or the place to ponder what might have been for this team - not when everybody was losing their mind at the joy of it all - but the realisation will dawn at some point that this should have been a Grand Slam season for Les Bleus.\nThat one inexplicable blip at Twickenham will confound experts for the rest of time. \nOne of the great wings of his generation (Damian Penaud) and arguably the greatest player ever (Dupont) both fumbled glorious chances to score. It's as surreal now as it was in real time.\nNearly everything else France have done this season has had world class written all over it. \nThe 43-0 drubbing of Wales on opening night was a record home win over the visitors. It was the first time they'd 'nilled' the Welsh in the championship in more than a quarter of a century.\nThe 73 points they put on Italy was the second highest total in a match in the history of the competition.\nThe trip to Dublin, billed as the clash of the heavyweights, turned into a one-sided romp. With awesome power and gorgeous subtlety, France put in one of the greatest away Six Nations performances that anybody can remember.\nIt was Ireland's biggest defeat at home in 12 years and France's total of 42 points was the most they'd scored in that fixture on Irish soil.\nThis video can not be played\nBielle-Biarrey scores try for France\nGame by game, they threatened to rewrite the record books. Before Saturday, there were potential milestones at every turn. \nThey needed four tries to get to 30 for the tournament, thereby breaking a mark set by England 24 years ago. \nThey duly broke that record just after the hour when Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Gael Fickou set up Yoram Moefana for a clinical score that showed France at their best.\nBielle-Biarrey already had a slice of history with an all-time high of 11 try involvements but he was looking for more. Another score would have taken him to eight for the championship - a record for the Six Nations. He delivered. Again.\nHis try early in the second half, a breakaway thing sparked by Ntamack, was crucial as it set France on their way. He now joins England's Cyril Lowe and Scotland's Ian Smith in a holy trinity who have scored eight championship tries in a single season.\nGiven that those two gentlemen did their thing in 1914 and 1925, you get a sense of the scale of what the young Bordeaux wizard has been doing.\nOthers turned up with collective glory and individual immortality in mind. \nBefore kick-off, Penaud was level with Serge Blanco as France's most prolific try-scorer. One more and he was out on his own, a new record of 39 tries in his 56th appearance. It took Blanco 93 games to get the mountain top in the first place.\nPenaud will have to wait for another day, but Thomas Ramos overtook Frederic Michalak's record of 436 points for his country. Another history man.\nIn their clear blue sky, the one cloud is the lack of a Slam, but given where French rugby is right now you wonder how much longer they'll be waiting. Prediction: not very long at all.\nFrench clubs have won the last four Champions Cup and three of the past four Challenge Cups. It would be the least surprising thing in global rugby if that trend continued in a few months.\nToulouse, the reigning champions, have already beaten Ulster 61-21, Exeter 64-21 and Leicester 80-12. Bordeaux, the fiercely impressive contenders, have put 69 points on Exeter and 66 points on the Sharks. They're a pair of behemoths.\nEngland are improving, Ireland regressing, but France are steaming ahead. On Friday they won the Under-20 Six Nations for the first time since 2018.\nThough still kids, 18 of the 23 that beat Scotland have played for their clubs this season. Toulouse, Bordeaux, Toulon, La Rochelle - all the biggest French guns have given game time to their youth. They start them early here.\nTheir under-age system has seen them win three of the past four Junior World Cups and they were beaten in the final of the other. One of the scariest things for everybody else is the age profile.\nTheo Attissogbe - three tries in his two games in the championship - is only 20. Bielle-Biarrey, Oscar Jegou and Hugo Auradou, all involved on Saturday, are 21. Nolann le Garrec, who was Maxime Lucu's deputy, is 22. Leo Barre, not in the squad for the denouement but scorer of two tries in his one game, is also 22.\nThere are other potential superstars waiting in the wings - Marko Gazzotti, the brilliant 20-year-old back-row from Bordeaux; Emilien Gailleton, the outstanding 21-year-old centre from Pau; Nicolas Depoortere, already an important figure in a magnificent Bordeaux backline at the age of 22.\nThe list isn't endless, but it can feel like it at times. \nAs they whooped and hollered and paraded the trophy around the Stade de France, you got an overwhelming sense that this Belle Epoque in rugby boots is only just getting started.",

        "article_text": "A mum whose friend's death from leukaemia prompted her to bank stem cells from her newborn's umbilical cord has described it as a \"back-up\" which has brought her reassurance.\nNatalie Harrop, 40, from Newport, arranged to have a stem cell harvesting procedure with her baby son Arthur and said it was a \"really straightforward\" but important process.\nThe cells remain banked for the family to use if needed until Arthur turns 25, after which they can decide whether or not to donate them.\nLeukaemia & Myeloma Research UK (LMRUK) said stem cells could be used for future treatment of blood cancers and other life-threatening illnesses, and described them as \"effective biological health insurance\".\nMs Harrop, a school wellbeing officer, was inspired to research leukaemia and cancer treatments following the death of her friend and colleague Jacqueline Walsh.\nShe described Ms Walsh as \"a lovely lady\" who was generous with her time, raising money for many different charities. \"She touched everybody's hearts,\" she added.\nOne area of research Ms Harrop became interested in was stem cell harvesting, after discovering there were more than a million blood-producing stem cells in the blood within the umbilical cord and placenta.\nPregnant with her fourth child, Arthur, Ms Harrop discussed the procedure with her partner Gary Hardwick-Bishop, who agreed that they should apply to have it done.\nThe procedure involves the cells being retrieved from the umbilical cord after birth, stored and then collected to be banked.\n\"It feels like you've got a little back-up there, so if anything does come up, we have that on the side if we ever do need it,\" said Ms Harrop, whose other children are aged eight, 14 and 18.\n\"And not just for our family, but for anyone who is a DNA match to Arthur or to me, anybody that needs them.\"\nMs Harrop explained there were some criteria they had to meet to be eligible, including having someone in their family who had had cancer.\n\"Gary's dad had cancer in the past and recovered, so it was really important to him as well, and my grandad died of cancer when I was young,\" she said.\nThe mum said she faced \"quite a few barriers\" and had to \"jump through a few hoops\" to gather the correct documentation, but added she felt this was due to a lack of awareness among medical professionals and said the process itself was completely non-invasive.\nShe now hopes raising awareness about it will make the process more widely considered.\nMs Harrop recalled one midwife being quite unsure about it and asking if she was \"jinxing herself\".\n\"There's nothing negative that can come from it. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, if the stem cells get damaged, they get damaged, but at least you've tried.\"\nAfter seeking out her grandfather's death certificate as part of the application process and seeing his name, Arthur, on it, Ms Harrop said it also prompted the couple to name their baby after him.\nMr Hardwick-Bishop contacted the phlebotomist when Ms Harrop went into labour and Arthur was born at The Grange hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen, on 31 October 2023 following a \"horrendous birth\".\n\"I ended up having an emergency caesarean, but whether you have a good birth or a bad birth you can still collect the cells, it doesn't really matter,\" said Ms Harrop.\nThe cord and placenta cells were transferred into a freezer, which stayed beside Ms Harrop at the hospital until they were collected and taken to a bank.\n\"They sent me a letter and a little certificate as well,\" she said.\nShe continued: \"Since we kept his stem cells I've done a bit more research and it just seems like it's really difficult when children or adults need stem cells, they're not on hand.\n\"Which seems such a shame, when there are so many births daily. It just baffles me there are all these stem cells going to waste.\"\nLMRUK runs a cord blood banking service, the Model Cell Biobank, and said taking stem cells from a baby's umbilical cord was \"effective biological health insurance\", providing options for treatment of the child or another member of the family should they need the stem cells in the future because of a serious illness, including blood cancer.\nLMRUK recently partnered with Smart Cells International, a private stem cell storage company, to procure, process and store cord blood stem cells for qualifying families.\nThe service is means-tested and is part-funded for some families, and fully funded for others, such as Ms Harrop's.\nDr Joanna Tilley, operations director at LMRUK, said stem cells were \"vital\" in cancer treatment, adding medical research was revealing new potential future uses for them.\nMs Harrop added: \"Any new mums considering this, there is absolutely nothing to lose.\n\"If Jacki was alive, she was such a funny person and I can just imagine her saying it was amazing, she'd be the first one to be promoting anything like this.\"",

        "article_text": "Chelsea had lost their three previous Women's League Cup finals\nOne match down, three to go - and it was Chelsea who came out on top against Manchester City in the first meeting of a quickfire four-game run.\nWith a first trophy of the season in the bag and their quadruple hopes intact, Sonia Bompastor's side were understandably all smiles as they left Pride Park.\nThe Women's Super League leaders were favourites to win the League Cup having gone unbeaten in all competitions this season, while City only had days to prepare with interim manager Nick Cushing starting his role on Tuesday.\nHowever, City arguably performed better in Saturday's final, creating numerous chances and putting Chelsea under pressure - before the Blues showed their ruthless streak to win 2-1 and lift the trophy. \nIn the end, Chelsea did what they do best - winning trophies.\n\"It feels great for sure, I'm really happy. The performance was maybe not a great one but we find a way to win the game,\" said Bompastor.\n\"City are a really good team so it was a tough game, but we were expecting that. We created some opportunities and did enough to win this game.\"\nChelsea beat Man City to win Women's League Cup\nPride Park pitch 'not fit' for League Cup final\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nThis video can not be played\nChelsea edge past Man City to win League Cup\nBompastor's celebrations after winning her first trophy with Chelsea will be subdued. \nThe players have a curfew and will be in bed before 21:00 GMT, she says, because in four days they will do it all again.\nCity host Chelsea in the first leg of their Women's Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, before a WSL showdown at Etihad Stadium and then the European second leg at Stamford Bridge. \nBompastor believes winning the first match of the four can be a \"big advantage\", but does not want her players to be complacent.\n\"Psychologically it's really important to win the first one,\" she said.\n\"Of course, it won't be the main element going into the next game but in terms of confidence, it's really positive. You always recover better when you win games. \n\"That's a big advantage but it won't be enough just to think that because we won today, it will be enough to win the game on Wednesday. \n\"It's really important in this really rare situation - when you have to face the same team four times in 12 days - to take it game by game.\"\nThe defeat for City was crushing. They came close, tested goalkeeper Hannah Hampton and fought back to grab an equaliser in the second half. \nCity were on top before Yui Hasegawa's unfortunate own goal restored Chelsea's lead having failed to capitalise on their dominance. Now interim boss Cushing must make sure they do not lose belief. \n\"That's my job, to swing this into being motivation rather than the deflation of losing, or the fear that we are playing a better team,\" he said. \n\"I'm a simple guy. This feeling that you get when you lose finals - if that is not enough motivation, then we are playing the wrong game. \n\"If watching that game back doesn't give you the belief that you can go on and win... we did enough to win the game and we had many moments. \n\"I was proud of that. If you carry that disappointment, it won't help on Wednesday. We can't do anything about this one now.\"\nNick Cushing met the Manchester City squad on Tuesday morning\nThere was intrigue this week to see what changes Cushing would make after stepping in last minute following the sudden sacking of Gareth Taylor.\nCushing previously enjoyed a successful seven-year spell at City, with his first trophy success coming in the Women's League Cup in 2016. \nBut limited by injuries, Cushing did not change too much on the pitch, instead focusing on pushing his players to \"believe\" in their quality.\nAsked what worked and what did not, Cushing said: \"The result didn't work! But I want this team to be a threat and to believe that it can be a threat - however the game goes and whoever we play. I hope you could see that. \n\"I thought we had multiple moments in their box and put them under pressure many times. We had real belief we could get back into the game.\n\"These finals always swing on moments. The moment fell to Chelsea and we didn't get back in it at 2-1 down. \n\"But I've seen enough to know that we can be competitive in the next three games. I have the belief that this team can win. I wouldn't be here if I didn't.\"\nThere were positives in City's performance but the concern is that Chelsea found a way to carve out a victory even when they were not at their best. \n\"I know this team has more than we showed today. But when you play with elite clubs, your job is to win games,\" said Bompastor. \n\"That is the most important thing. You have to find a way to win. I would love to have both - I would be the most happiest person. \n\"But if it's not possible, the one thing I would pick is winning.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'Recover and move to the next game' - White on Chelsea's quadruple hopes\nThe next three games could define both clubs' seasons.\nCity are out of the WSL title race but must secure a top-three spot to ensure they are in the Champions League next season, as well as throwing everything at their two-legged quarter-final with Chelsea. \nBompastor's side remain on course to win a quadruple and will not want to lose ground in any competition.\nSo what will Wednesday bring?\n\"We have to be prepared for anything. We could be seeing changes. You never know what you are coming up against,\" said Chelsea captain Millie Bright. \n\"It is an unusual position for two teams to be in and I don't think it's ever happened before. They are in the same position as we are.\n\"Momentum in football is just such a big thing, especially when you are playing the same opponent four times in a row. It is so important to be champions.\"",

        "article_text": "Cher Horowitz has brought her life of Beverly Hills high fashion, friendship and matchmaking to London's West End, as classic 1990s teen film Clueless has been given a musical makeover.\nClueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.\nHeckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.\nThe story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself. \nAn adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.\nThe stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.\nThe Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".\nShe says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".\nThe process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.\n\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.\nHeckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".\n\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.\nCritics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\". \nSimilarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\". \nBut What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".\nFor Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience. \n\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"\nFlynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".\nCo-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor. \n\"The flip phone was the most advanced technology they had in the 90s and there's something so enchanting about a time where there was no access to social media,\" he says.\nThe show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman. \nWhile it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems. \nThe Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.\n\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.\nFor Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters. \nJane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.\n\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.\n\"Those themes are universal and that's what makes this story so enduring.\"",

        "article_text": "The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never intended to stay for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to be just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected.\u00a0\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stayed for longer.\u00a0\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days\u00a0living aboard the\u00a0American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\nHis time in orbit \u2013 which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days \u2013 was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space \u2013 a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in\u00a0a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is\u00a0expected to take around 1,100 days\u00a0(just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\nMuscles and bones\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\nSimilarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth.\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\nWeight loss\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit \u2013 the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\nEyesight\nOn Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent.\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\nNeural shuffling\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function \u2013 in other words, movement \u2013 and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\nFriendly bacteria\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\nResearchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.)\nSkin\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers \u2013 like Rubio, who spent one year in space \u2013 will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\nThere were also some changes in gene expression \u2013 the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells \u2013 seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system\u00a0was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n* This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

It's a career path I wouldn't even have looked into but I'm really excited by it.\"\nSonia Shaljean, who runs the organisation, says she knew Harley had huge potential, even though he was \"quite shut down\" when he joined them.\nShe believes fatherlessness is a key factor in issues from crime and addiction to school exclusions, homelessness and male suicide.\n\"It's not taken seriously enough,\" she says. \"We skirt around the issue, and it's almost controversial to say it, but boys need a supportive father figure.\n\"Some people are offended by our name - Lads Need Dads - but I stand by it.

It's a misconception that father absence is just an issue in certain communities.\"\nNot all fathers are absent by choice, she says.\n\"Some were wonderful dads but have sadly passed away. Some boys have been abandoned by their fathers but others desperately want to be involved in their sons' lives and some even struggle with suicidal thoughts as a result.\"\nAround the eight-month mark of the programme, boys often start to talk about their fathers, she says.\n\"As their confidence grows, some feel ready to explore the possibility of reconnecting and many go on to re-establish a relationship with their dads.\"\nSonia set up Lads Need Dads 10 years ago, with an initial grant of \u00a34,000, having worked for more than 20 years on the frontlines of criminal justice, addiction, domestic abuse and homelessness.\n\"I kept seeing the same heartbreaking pattern - so many men stuck in cycles of crime, addiction, and hopelessness. And nearly every time, there was one thing they had in common: growing up without a father or a positive male role model.\n\"I thought 'I've got to do something'. If we don't provide a service for these boys we won't break this cycle,\" she says.\nAbout 250 boys have been helped by the organisation. \nCharlie Howlett, 19, says it saved his life when he joined six years ago.\nHis mother had died when he was a two, leaving his father to bring him and his younger brother up alone.\n\"My dad didn't take it too well and it wasn't the best situation growing up,\" he adds.\nThe brothers moved in with their nan and aunt a few years later, but still remained close to their dad until he died suddenly from a blood clot when Charlie was 12.\nCharlie tried to be strong for everyone and be the father figure. \"But I couldn't cope,\" he says. \"I was lashing out at everyone and started thinking about taking my own life.\"\nLads Need Dads has given him an \"unimaginable\" amount of support, he says.\n\"I thought I was the only person going through it, then I met this group of boys my age who were also growing up without a dad.\n\"The mentors were a huge part of it for me. You grow to trust them like your own dad.\"\nSonia and her team supported Charlie three years ago when his nan, who he was still living with, also died.\n\"They have helped me be a better big brother and I think that has kept him on a good path too,\" he adds.\nSonia helped Charlie get a plumbing apprenticeship and, for the last year, he has also been mentoring boys on the programme.\n\"It's a really good feeling to know I'm giving something back.

        "article_text": "In Japan, a smelly waste product is being reimagined as a potential clean fuel of the future that is powering cars and tractors.\nWe're being eyed suspiciously by dozens of cows. Their breath fogs cartoonishly from their nostrils.\nIt's a brisk morning in snowy Hokkaido, an island in the north of Japan. The cold air carries the distinct scent of cow manure \u2013 a smelly yet familiar side-effect of the region's thriving dairy industry. Accounting for 20% of the country's landmass, this island is the second-largest in Japan. It's also home to over a million cows, which produce over half of the country's milk and dairy products.\nWe are visiting one farm in Hokkaido that wants to transform the source of the pungent aroma in the air into something valuable. They are turning cattle manure into hydrogen.\u00a0\nWhen it is burned, hydrogen does not emit carbon, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. There are widespread hopes it could be used as a sustainable fuel to heat homes and power cars, trains, aircraft and ships in the future.\nBut the most common way of producing hydrogen today involves using methane \u2013 a fossil fuel piped up from deep underground, meaning it is still associated with significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.\nThe Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source \u2013 a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. Around 20 million tonnes of cow manure is generated in Hokkaido annually. If not treated correctly, it can be an environmental burden, producing significant methane emissions as well as affecting water quality if allowed to leak into streams and rivers. So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?\n\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. We are visiting the facility in Shikaoi, a town in central Hokkaido, to film an upcoming episode of the BBC's TechXplore focusing on Japan. \"Shikaoi accounts for 30% of Hokkaido\u2019s cow waste and urine, so it has great potential for renewable energy.\"\nLaunched in 2015 by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, the project aims to convert agricultural by-products into hydrogen to supply the local, rural community in a circular economy.\u00a0The cow excrement and urine is collected from local dairy farms before being fed into a anaerobic digester at a central facility. Here bacteria break down the organic waste to produce biogas and a liquid fertiliser. The biogas is then purified into methane that is used to manufacture hydrogen.\nThe plant now has a hydrogen production capacity of 70 cubic metres (18,500 gallons), with an onsite fuelling station that can fill around 28 vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells per day, says Abe. Although the fuel can be used by cars with fuel cells, the plant's fuelling station has been specially designed to accommodate agricultural vehicles such as tractors and forklift trucks. These farm vehicles are difficult to electrify with batteries due to their size and the type of work they do. The hydrogen-powered vehicles are used around the farms' sites, reducing the emissions that would otherwise be created by using other fuel sources.\u00a0\nCattle-made-hydrogen is also stored in canisters that are transported to provide power and heat to other facilities in the area, including a local sturgeon fish farm and the nearby Obihiro Zoo.\nBut hydrogen isn't without its problems. It needs to be stored in high-pressure tanks as a gas, and can be prone to leakage due to its low molecular weight. It can also degrade metal storage containers, leaving them embrittled, and is easily ignited and so requires additional safety precautions when handling it.\nHydrogen can also be stored as a liquid by chilling it to cryogenic temperatures of below \u2013253C (-423F), but this can be energy intensive and requires large amounts of additional infrastructure.\nHydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of petrol (gasoline) when taken by mass alone. But its low molecular weight also means that by volume, the energy packed into a litre of liquid hydrogen is a quarter that of petrol. Put simply, as the lightest gas in the Universe, hydrogen takes up more space kilogram for kilogram than petrol. This means a lot more storage space is needed for hydrogen compared to fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and natural gas. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.\nBut as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.\nHokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.\nUsing agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses\u00a0the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Here, steam heated to 800C (1,472F) reacts with the methane to produce hydrogen, along with the byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO2).\u00a0\nIn the case of cow manure, however, says Abe, the project remains sustainable as this carbon originated in the grass the cows grazed on: \"Since it was originally in the atmosphere, it is considered carbon neutral.\"\nIn addition, it helps to prevent the methane that would otherwise have been emitted from the manure from getting into the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas.\nLeftover slurry from the manure after the biogas has been extracted is sprayed as fertiliser onto nearby fields, while formic acid \u2013 which is both used in and created by the processes \u2013 could be offered as a preservative for cattle feed, says Abe.\u00a0\nCurrently, the electricity needed to produce and store the hydrogen comes from the national grid. But Abe says there's potential to shift to green energy, given Hokkaido\u2019s promising sea, wind and geothermal potential, thus reducing the carbon emissions of this electricity.\nStill, other challenges remain. The high cost of the hydrogen compared to fossil fuels and low demand mean expanding the operation is difficult.\u00a0\n\"The construction costs of hydrogen stations are very high,\" says Abe. \"Since hydrogen vehicles are not yet widespread, we're keeping our filling capacity low to manage initial investment. As adoption increases, we'll expand supply.\"\nTo encourage hydrogen vehicle adoption in the area, hydrogen prices are subsidised by the plant, matching the cost of petrol. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.\nHype Meter\nThe process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure. With other countries exploring how to use other types of waste, from pig dung to coconut husks, to produce hydrogen using similar processes, it appears this could be a model adaptable to other local contexts.\nWith the scale still small, however, and costs of production high, it remains to be seen how widespread this industry can be. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen.\u00a0\nJapan is the world leader in hydrogen vehicles and has invested considerably in developing the technology. But for now battery-powered electric vehicles remain cheaper than hydrogen powered ones.\nThough it's unlikely that cow manure alone will ever meet Japan's hydrogen demand, it could contribute significantly, and Shikaoi is creating a model for a circular economy that it hopes will show how costs can fall with the economies of scale.\u00a0\nAnd there is growing interest in other parts of the world in using waste materials to produce hydrogen, with pig dung, poultry waste and even coconut husks having been explored as potential feedstocks. In Thailand, vehicle manufacturer Toyota is even exploring the use of hydrogen made from chicken waste to fuel its vehicles.\nMeanwhile, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago in the US recently developed another promising method to make hydrogen involving manure. In their case, they used the manure, along with sugarcane waste and corn husks, to make biochar, a carbon-rich substance which vastly reduces the amount of electricity needed to convert water to hydrogen.\n\"We are the first group to show that you can produce hydrogen utilising biomass at a fraction of a volt,\" says Meenesh Singh, a chemical engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago who led the project.\nIn the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, on Kyushu, meanwhile, another waste product is being used to produce hydrogen \u2013 and here the dung is from humans.\nFor more than a decade, hydrogen has been created at the city's sewage treatment plant for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Most recently it has been used to fuel a fleet of zero-emission rubbish trucks.\nAkira Miyaoka, hydrogen utilisation manager for Fukuoka City, says trucks that transport daily products are the town's main source of CO2, rather than large factories as in many other cities. \"So we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from commercial trucks,\" she says.\nThe initiative started as a collaboration between Kyushu University and Fukuoka City, but now involves several major companies including Toyota.\n\"Sewage is something that is steadily discharged every day in the daily lives of citizens, so by making effective use of that sewage and extracting hydrogen as energy, we can achieve local production and local consumption of energy,\" says Miyaoka.\u00a0\nGenerating hydrogen from human waste starts with water from various household sources \u2013 including showers, dishwashers and toilets \u2013 arriving at the treatment plant. As the water is cleaned, the residual sludge is kept as a source of biogas and converted into hydrogen.\u00a0\n\"Sewage and biogas contain various impurities, so the process begins with the process of removing those impurities, which I think is a little different from other hydrogen production processes,\" says Miyaoka.\nIn 2024, Toyota helped the city launch Japan\u2019s first hydrogen-powered service vehicle fleet, including ambulances, delivery vans and bin trucks. Officials at the sewage treatment plant say it is capable of producing 300kg (661lbs) of hydrogen in 12 hours \u2013 enough to fuel 30 trucks.\u00a0\nThe rubbish trucks head out six nights each week, each collecting 1.7 tonnes (3,700lb) of rubbish, all while running silently and emission-free on the bodily waste of the people they are collecting other waste from.\nFukuoka's sewage-to-hydrogen fuelling station has been around since 2015, and several other countries around the world are now adopting a similar approach.\nConcord Blue has developed waste-to-energy plants in Germany, India, Japan and the US, converting waste and biomass into hydrogen and bioenergy. Several water authorities in the UK are also working on projects to derive hydrogen from sewage.\nA prototype race car has also been developed using sewage-derived hydrogen in the UK. The Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), in partnership with Severn Trent Water, is harnessing microbes that generate hydrogen fuel from waste. They anticipate the technology could hit the mainstream within five years, despite existing challenges. (Read about how sewage-powered cars could be the future of motorsport.)\nOn a larger scale, aviation accounts for 2% of global carbon emissions, and researchers in a UK lab have developed jet fuel made entirely from human sewage.\nStill, despite the promise, all of these technologies have yet to be delivered at significant scale.\nWhether in rural or city landscapes, the Japanese projects we've seen during in filming are inspiring because they have the local community at their heart.\nWhile adoption of hydrogen cars has stalled, hydrogen truck adoption is increasing gradually and it is these larger heavier industrial vehicles that contribute most significantly per vehicle to greenhouse gas emissions.\nBy reimagining waste as a resource, these projects demonstrate that energy can be found in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Paul Carter is the presenter of TechXplore.

        "article_text": "Cher Horowitz has brought her life of Beverly Hills high fashion, friendship and matchmaking to London's West End, as classic 1990s teen film Clueless has been given a musical makeover.\nClueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.\nHeckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.\nThe story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself. \nAn adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.\nThe stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.\nThe Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".\nShe says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".\nThe process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.\n\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.\nHeckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".\n\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.\nCritics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\". \nSimilarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\". \nBut What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".\nFor Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience. \n\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"\nFlynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".\nCo-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor. \n\"The flip phone was the most advanced technology they had in the 90s and there's something so enchanting about a time where there was no access to social media,\" he says.\nThe show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman. \nWhile it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems. \nThe Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.\n\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.\nFor Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters. \nJane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.\n\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.\n\"Those themes are universal and that's what makes this story so enduring.\"",

Clueless is backCher Horowitz has brought her life of Beverly Hills high fashion, friendship and matchmaking to London's West End, as classic 1990s teen film Clueless has been given a musical makeover.Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.Heckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" But What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".Pamela RaithCritics have praised Emma Flynn and Keelan McAuley for their performances as Cher and JoshFor Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience. \"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.Pamela RaithThe glamour of Beverley Hills in the 90s has been bought to Trafalgar Theatre in London For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters. \"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.",

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

Two prancing horses on the front perhaps a nod to the surrounding cattle-grazing and sugarcane fields.\nYet what lies behind the black iron doors is allegedly evidence of some of Mexico's worst drug cartel violence of recent times.\nFollowing a tip-off about the possible location of a mass grave, an activist group of relatives of some of Mexico's thousands of disappeared people went to the ranch, hoping to find some sign of their missing loved ones.\nWhat they found was far worse: 200 pairs of shoes, hundreds of items of clothing, scores of suitcases and rucksacks, discarded after the owners themselves were apparently disposed of.\nEven more chilling, several ovens and human bone fragments were found at the ranch. \nThe site was used, the activists claim, by the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG) for the forced recruitment and training of their foot-soldiers, and for torturing their victims and cremating their bodies.\n\"There were children's toys in there,\" says Luz Toscano, a member of the Buscadores Guerreros de Jalisco Collective. \n\"People were desperate,\" she recalls.\n\"They'd see the shoes and say: 'those look like the ones my missing relative was wearing when they disappeared'.\" \nToscano believes the authorities must now go through all the personal effects piece by piece and make them available to the families for closer inspection.\nFor many, however, the worst part of the gruesome discovery is that local police raided the ranch, near the village of Teuchitl\u00e1n, as recently as last September. \nWhile at the time they made 10 arrests and released two hostages, they either didn't find or didn't reveal any evidence of the apparent magnitude of violence carried out there.\nWhile the full picture is still to come over what action, if any, was taken by the municipal and state authorities after last year's operation, critics and victims' families openly accuse them of complicity with the cartels in Jalisco.\nState Governor Pablo Lemus responded in a video message.\nHis administration was cooperating fully with the federal authorities, he said, and insisted that \"no one in Jalisco is washing their hands\" of the case.\nFor Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the events in Jalisco threaten to overshadow a strong start to her presidency. \nGiven the serious doubts about the actions of the local police and the state attorney general's office, she has ordered federal investigators to take charge of the case.\nShe urged people not to jump to conclusions while the investigation is ongoing.\n\"It is important is to make the investigation before we come to any conclusions,\" she said in her morning press briefing earlier this week.\n\"What did they find at the site? Before anything else, we must hear from the attorney general's office, which is the agency responsible, and they will let the entire country know what they have found.\"\nWhether most Mexicans will believe the official version of events, however, is another question.\nThe place is now crawling with police officers, federal investigators and forensics teams in dust overalls. \nWhatever they conclude, though, the media in Mexico is calling the Izaguirre Ranch an \"extermination\" site.\nMeanwhile, more search teams of victims' relatives have come to the state capital, Guadalajara, ahead of a protest march this weekend to urge the authorities to do more to find Mexico's missing people.\nRosario Maga\u00f1a was among them. She is the mother of Carlos Amador Maga\u00f1a, who disappeared in June 2017. He was just 19 years old.\n\"I still feel desperate, as it's been eight years and I'm still in the same situation,\" she said - speaking of her endless search for her son who was kidnapped along with his best friend.\n\"It's a very, very slow process when it comes to the state attorney general's office and the investigation.\"\n\"I still have faith and hope of finding him,\" she stressed. \"But I'm in a situation which doesn't move forward, and it's discouraging.\"\nAs she left a church service for the unknown victims at the ranch in Teuchitl\u00e1n, Rosario said the allegations of mistakes, oversight, collusion and negligence in the case only underlined the uphill struggle mothers like her have faced for years in obtaining answers to the most basic of questions about their children's whereabouts.\n\"There are so many mass graves in Jalisco, so many cartel safehouses, the authorities know the CJNG's modus operandi.

There is always something missing.\n\"The will to play well and to attack is there. The lads want to win and do their best.

We need to lose games to know what it feels like to play at the level the Six Nations is at, as Italy had that opportunity in the early 2000s.\n\"We feel we've earned the right, not to be given that place, we want the opportunity to prove that potentially we're good enough to compete on a regular basis at that level.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'WRU must cut a region to solve Welsh rugby crisis' - Warburton\nCockerill does however admit the prospect of a play-off in the near future is unlikely. \n\"I don't think so. If you're in the Six Nations you wouldn't want to be voting for that type of play-off, would you?\" he added. \n\"Because it might be you, and the ramifications of not being in the Six Nations, from a rugby point of view but also from a financial point of view, would be very, very difficult.\n\"It's a bit like a Championship football club getting into the Premiership isn't it? You know it would be the richest game in world rugby. \n\"That would be a game people would want to watch and the money involved and the profile involved for Georgian rugby would catapult us into a completely different sphere if we were good enough to beat whoever finishes bottom.\n\"And if we lose, well we re-group, we keep developing and we fight for the opportunity to do that again. I don't see that as an unreasonable request.\"\nFormer England hooker and forwards coach Richard Cockerill was appointed head coach of Georgia in January 2024\nCockerill was part of England's coaching staff under Eddie Jones and led the team on an interim basis when the Australian was sacked in 2022.\nCurrently in charge of both the Georgian national team and the country's leading club side Black Lion, the former Leicester forward says he is not interested in Welsh rugby vacancies.\nThe Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) are looking for a new director of rugby as well as a full-time replacement for Warren Gatland, who left the Wales head coach role during the 2025 Six Nations.\n\"I think the Welsh job would be attractive for anybody,\" said Cockerill.\n\"It's a fantastic country with fantastic history, a country that loves its rugby. \n\"But whoever comes in next has got to be given time from top to bottom to develop the players that Wales need to be competitive because I think you look at the moment at players available for Wales, are they really good enough to be competing and being competitive in the Six Nations?\n\"I think honestly, and with all respect to everybody, I just think that they haven't quite got the quality at this point.\n\"They may grow into it with a lot of young players being in and around the squad, but they're not quite good enough at the moment so whoever comes in is going to need time - and we know in professional sport the one thing you don't get... is the opportunity to build a squad and settle in and build it from the ground up, which at the moment is probably where Wales is at.\"",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

Commercial income, which includes sponsorships, partnerships, merchandising sales and pre-season tour income, is expected to represent the largest share of revenue across women's sports (54%), with broadcast revenues contributing 25% and matchday revenues providing the remaining 21%.Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in the Deloitte Sports Business Group, said: \"The growth of women's sport has continued to exceed expectations as various competitions, leagues, clubs and athletes generate significant returns, despite limited resources. \"How do WSL clubs make money?Published6 FebruaryWhat to look out for in Women's Champions League quarter-finalsPublished1 day agoWomen's FA Cup semi-final dates set with both live on BBCPublished4 days ago'More work to be done'However, despite the growth, a Fifa report, external into women's football published on Monday underlined the financial disparity in wages and sponsorship between genders.Key findings from Fifa's annual report into women's football - entitled Setting the Pace - emphasised the financial state of the game.The average annual salary for a female player globally is \u00a38,400 ($10,900), a figure which is also skewed by a small number of top clubs.Among the teams Fifa designated as being in the top tier, which includes 41 clubs from 16 countries, the average salary was around \u00a318,500 ($24,030), with the highest of those \u00a393,000 ($120,000).For clubs categorised by Fifa as being in second and third tiers, the average salaries of players were \u00a33,357 ($4,361) and \u00a32,160 ($2,805) respectively.Only four women's domestic leagues have title sponsorships worth more than \u00a3770,000 ($1m).Attendances were also highlighted as an area of concern by the report.Arsenal hosted Manchester United in front of a Women's Super League record 60,160 fans at Emirates Stadium last year.However, tier one teams averaged 1,713 fans, while those in tiers two and three were 480 and 380 respectively.Arsenal were among the 23% of clubs that played some matches at a stadium other than their regular ground, playing five home league games at The Emirates and the rest at Meadow Park, which has a seating capacity of 1,700 and total capacity of 4,500.Women are underrepresented in coaching roles, with 22% of head coaches across all tiers being women.There is more gender equity among officials, with 42% of referees being female, ranging from 57% in tier leagues to 25% in tiers two and three. \"The commercial appeal of women's sports and its athletes has never been higher, as the sector continues to shine on the global stage. She added: \"Major events are increasing visibility and participation across many sports and geographies, but deliberate actions need to be taken after these big moments to drive domestic success for leagues and clubs.",

        "article_text": "For country music singer Riley, this weekend is her chance to showcase her \"country-pop\" sound in her hometown.  \nThe Glasgow-born musician is performing at the Country 2 Country (C2C) music festival, which is taking place in Glasgow, London and Belfast. \nAhead of her performance in at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, she told BBC Scotland News how the city of her birth inspires her music. \nAnd she revealed that her musical hero, Taylor Swift, has inspired her in the business-side of the music industry. \n\"I've learned so much from Taylor. She's probably one of the smartest businesswomen I've ever seen,\" Riley says. \nSwift is famously re-recording six albums after her former music manager Scooter Braun gained control of the master recordings.\nShe has said she saw it as a an act of aggression that \"stripped me of my life's work\". \nRiley said Swift's experiences showed her the importance of keeping the rights to her songs and gave her the confidence to explore other genres of music.\n\"You're na\u00efve when you're younger,\" says Riley, who was 11 when she was introduced to Swift's music by a school friend, inspiring her to write her own songs. \n\"You think 'I'll write the songs, I'll wear the dresses, I'll play on the stages and somebody else will handle the business aspect of things' but actually Taylor has shown me that's not the case.\"\nFollowing Swift's example, Riley worked hard and saved to produce her own music \"song by song, one by one\", while retaining the rights to them.\nSince starting her career at age 17, Riley has toured with fellow Scottish artists ili and Tide Lines.\nRecent trips to Nashville to collaborate and meet others in the industry have helped develop her career and the confidence to stay as an independent artist until the time is right.\n\"I used to hate the thought of being independent. It had a stigma attached that they're not good enough to get signed or they won't be able to do it,\" she says.\n\"When I realised what that word meant - that you don't need anyone and can accomplish things by yourself - I look back at my music that I've saved up song by song to produce, it was a ton of work but it's so worth it to see people listen to those songs.\"\nRiley's passion for music began after being introduced to artists like James Taylor and Joni Mitchell by her dad. Her grandmother gave her a book of poetry, leading her to write her own \"poems to a tune\".\nLike many teenagers, Riley enjoyed attending concerts but felt something different when she saw country artists perform.\n\"These country music gigs absolutely blew me away,\" she says.\n\"It had a hold on me and it made me realise I wanted to do that myself.\"\nRiley soon began to appreciate other country music artists - Ella Langley, Megan Moroney, Carter Faith and - to her, \"the Queen of everything\"- Kelsea Ballerini.\nFunding from charity Help Musicians was the key that allowed Riley to visit the country music city of Nashville and work on her new EP.\nThe EP even has nods to her hometown, mentioning Glasgow streets as well as a song dedicated to Maggie's Rock n Rodeo, a popular venue for country music fans.\n\"My song writing inspiration absolutely comes mixed from Glasgow and Nashville,\" she says.\n\"Glasgow feels a lot like Nashville to me. \n\"When I got to Nashville the first time, I phoned my mum and she asked how it was. I said it literally feels just like home.\"\nRiley is performing at King Tut's as part of the Country to Country festival on Sunday 16 March.",

It is not just the breakdown, but there is a physical raw edge to everything they are doing.\n\"It all makes your job so much easier, their back row were unbelievable.\"\nIn this year's Six Nations, England lead the way for turnovers won (36), slowing down their opponents' ruck speed, and jackals won (21).\nThe depth in the back row is only growing after 20-year-old Northampton Saints flanker Henry Pollock scored two tries on his debut, 21-year-old Chandler Cunningham-South also dotted down twice against Wales, while number eight Tom Willis, 26, impressed on his three starts.\nListen: The Six Nations review with Barclay and Warburton\n'Special' Pollock predicted try-scoring Test debut\n'I have not seen that complete an England performance for years'\nThis video can not be played\n'WRU must cut a region to solve Welsh rugby crisis' - Warburton\nWales' match in Italy in round two was their best shot of a victory this campaign but defeat ended Warren Gatland's troubled reign and left interim head coach Matt Sherratt with a tough task to restore pride in his three games in charge.\nHope that they could end their dreadful run of defeats before the end of the championship grew after a much-improved performance against Ireland.\nHowever, the campaign finished with Wales falling to a new low by conceding 68 points against England - the most in their Six Nations history.\nA 17th Test defeat on the bounce was also a record for a tier-one nation in the professional era and condemned Wales to a second successive Wooden Spoon.\nFormer Wales captain Sam Warburton believes now is the time for \"big changes\" and suggests cutting one of the Welsh regions in the United Rugby Championship.\n\"No action is the worst action now,\" he told Six Nations Rugby Special.\n\"Four regions do not work. Look at the impact - by accident - of losing three teams in the [English] Premiership. We need to concentrate our player pool into three teams.\n\"You can't make a decision that pleases everyone but you have to try and make the best decision that genuinely has the best impact on Welsh rugby.\n\"I can't see us winning another championship for five years, but if there is a five-year plan to buy into and get on board with then we will be on the right path.\"\nWelsh rugby reaches record low as England run riot \n'Wales players need support after record loss'\nSix Nations: France take the title and England thrash Wales\nThis video can not be played\nSheehan shines as Ireland hold off Italy but title bid falls short\nIreland began this year's Six Nations aiming for a record third successive title, and with games against England and France at home that goal seemed more than realistic.\nVictory in their final match against Italy meant Simon Easterby's side ended the campaign in third place with four wins out of five - the same as England and France - but the feeling in Rome differed from their rivals.\nA crushing defeat in Dublin against champions France ended their Grand Slam bid, and even with a possible title on the line, Ireland's championship petered out, with Italy pushing for a shock victory in the closing stages.\nThe campaign marked the end of the road for a trio of Test centurions as Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray all bowed out of the international arena.\nEight of Ireland's starting XV against France were also aged 30 or older, and Warburton feels there is going to be a \"good changing of the guard\" over the next three to four years in Irish rugby.\n\"When they start to lose those players [in their mid-30s], you start to think there is maybe not as much coming through as they would have had five to 10 years ago,\" he said.\n\"It is a bit alarming so they might want to hang on to those older players until some more players start to come through.\"\nInterim head coach Easterby will continue the transition this summer before Andy Farrell returns after British and Irish Lions duty this summer.\n'Evolution beckons for Ireland as legends bow out'\nIreland 'trying a bit too hard' in Italy win - Easterby\nBloodgate: The scandal that rocked rugby union\nThis video can not be played\nWhy France were deserved Six Nations winners\nFrance have been the great entertainers this championship, scoring a record 30 tries in five games to win their first title since 2022.\nIt was not all plain sailing in the first half against Scotland as a disallowed try prevented the visitors from leading at half-time.\nHowever, a dominant second-half display saw France score three tries to get the win they needed, with wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey racing clear for a record eighth score of the championship.\n\"He is probably going to get player of the tournament,\" Warburton said. \"A real superstar, another one France have to lean on.\"\nFabien Galthie again opted for a 7-1 bench split, which has proved a point of difference, as his side scored 1.2 more tries per game in the final 40 minutes.\nThey also gained more metres and line breaks on average in the second half of games.\n\"Their tries against Scotland were all caused from their power and physicality,\" Warburton added.\n\"When France got into the Scotland 22, Scotland found it difficult to contain them. I have it as 23 points scored from maul and carry dominance which led on to tries.\n\"In international rugby, if you win the power game, you win the game.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBielle-Biarrey stars in Six Nations best tries\nAre Scotland flattering to deceive? Or is this their level?\n'French rugby's Belle Epoque is only just beginning'\nFrance's Bielle-Biarrey breaks Six Nations try record\nThis video can not be played\nFrance thrash Scotland to become Six Nations champions\nScotland finished fourth for the second year running - and have now finished outside the top three six times since Gregor Townsend took charge in 2018.\nFull-back Blair Kinghorn topped this year's championship stats for carries (86), line breaks (9) and offloads (13), while he was second for defenders beaten (25) - only behind team-mate Duhan van der Merwe (28).\nGiven the majority of Scotland's backline are in contention to be heading on the Lions tour this summer, more was expected than just wins over Italy and Wales.\nDubbed as one of the most talented Scottish sides in the modern era, Barclay believes they lack punch in the forwards to support their talented backs, evident through France's seven destructive replacement forwards.\n\"The sense of frustration is why this group of players are not kicking on,\" Barclay said.\n\"I think there are generational backs in that team and the Lions selection will reflect that.\n\"They lack a little bit of grunt up front that France or England have.

        "article_text": "A fashion show held last week in a picturesque, snow-clad town in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked a major controversy that is still simmering.\nThe show, by the well-known fashion brand Shivan & Narresh, was held last Friday at a ski resort in Gulmarg to display their skiwear collection. The label is the first big, non-local brand to hold a fashion show in Kashmir, a scenic Himalayan region which has seen decades of violence.\nBut it soon sparked outrage among locals, politicians and religious leaders in Muslim-majority Kashmir after fashion publisher Elle India posted a video on social media which showed some models wearing underwear or bikinis. Locals were also angry over another video - shared by online magazine Lifestyle Asia - of a party held after the show, which showed people drinking alcohol outdoors.\nMany took offence with the show being held in the holy month of Ramadan - a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims - and accused the designers of \"mocking their faith\" and \"disregarding local culture and sentiments\". Some clerics called the show \"obscene\" and said it was like \"soft porn\". \nSome others explained that the outrage had arisen not only from religious conservatism, but also from a fear of cultural imposition from \"outsiders\". Kashmir has witnessed decades of armed separatist insurgency against Indian rule since the late 1980s. \nThe backlash prompted Elle India and Lifestyle Asia to delete their videos. Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja, the designers behind the label, also apologised, saying that their \"sole intention was to celebrate creativity\" and that they didn't intend to offend religious sentiments.\nKashmir - known as the land of saints and Sufism (Islamic mysticism) - has a rich tradition of spirituality which influences many aspects of peoples' lives. The traditional attire is modest, with locals - both men and women - often wearing the pheran, a long, loose cloak.\nThe row also moved off social media and a discussion about the show and the after-party caused a ruckus in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly.\nThe opposition criticised the government, accusing it of giving permission for the event despite being aware of local sensitivities. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah distanced his government from the event, saying it had been organised by private entities, and asking local authorities to investigate the matter and submit a report.\n\"If law has been violated, strict action will be taken,\" he said in the assembly on Monday. The police have not yet given details about who organised the event and what laws, if any, have been violated.\nThe fashion brand did not respond to the BBC's questions about the show, including about permissions it obtained.\nIt's not surprising that scenic Gulmarg - one of India's few skiing destinations and a favourite with tourists - was the choice of venue for a show highlighting a skiwear collection.\nFashion journalist Shefalee Vasudev says it's not uncommon for designers to want to hold fashion shows in exquisite locations.\nIn fact, international designers like Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld are remembered as much for their creative, theatrical fashion shows as they are for their iconic designs.\nBut experimentation brings with it the risk of controversy and so, it's important to be mindful of the political and cultural sensitivities of a place, Ms Vasudev told the BBC.\nAnd this holds especially true in a place like Kashmir, which has witnessed wars and decades of armed conflict.\nBoth India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the territory.\nThousands of people have been killed since the late 1980s, when a separatist insurgency broke out against Indian rule. Though the separatist movement has lost steam over the years, many locals continue to view the administration in Delhi with distrust.\nThese sentiments have deepened since 2019 when the federal government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, stripped the region of its autonomy.\nSo some locals told the BBC that they were not surprised by the reactions to the show.\n\"Everything in Kashmir is political; people see things through a political prism,\" says Mir, a professor at a local university (he asked for his surname to be withheld to protect his identity). He adds that people are sceptical about big corporate events like the fashion show and - even if they are organised by private players - they believe that the government is trying to dilute their culture.\nArshid Ahmad, a researcher, uses stronger words to express public angst. \"The government is trying to dilute the spirit of resistance in Kashmiris,\" he says.\nThis isn't the first time an event held by non-locals has triggered a controversy in Kashmir. In 2013, separatists and human rights activists in the region protested against a show by renowned conductor Zubin Mehta. They said it was an attempt by the government to show the world that all was well in Kashmir when people were \"suffering and dying\".\nSome of the recent apprehensions around culture and identity can also be tied to the increase in tourists to Kashmir from other states in India. The federal government has often connected this boom in tourism to the abrogation of Article 370, which stripped the region of its autonomy.\nNousheen Fatima, 34, says because of government messaging, people outside Kashmir now see the region as being safer and \"more assimilated with India\". But she alleges that many tourists do not respect the region's culture.\nLast year, a video showing tourists drinking alcohol during a boat ride on the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar evoked outrage from political and religious leaders, who called the behaviour \"un-Islamic and unethical\".\nIn February, locals put up posters in Srinagar, asking tourists to \"respect local culture and traditions\" and \"avoid alcohol and use of drugs\", but these were later pulled down by the police.\nIn an editorial for The Voice of Fashion magazine, Ms Vasudev argues that the outrage needs to be examined from a critical lens. She asks if it would have been all right for the show to have been held in another Indian city instead of Kashmir, where Muslims would also be observing Ramadan. And whether it would have been acceptable to hold the show in Kashmir if it featured only outfits perceived as modest.\nShe also points out that Kashmir is home to the \"world's finest wool yarn; some of the finest handspun, handwoven pashmina creations and its artisans\".\n\"What Kashmir creates and stands for cannot be replicated anywhere. Shouldn't a fashion show at Gulmarg then, with innovative garments made with 100% wool, be seen as regenerating interest in untried ways?\" she asks.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

There should be fairness, not politically correct body positivity. Adverts normalising an unhealthy weight, be it obese or severely underweight, are equally as harmful.\"\nBut Snag founder Ms Read says: \"Shaming fat people does not help them to lose weight and actually it really impacts mental health and therefore their physical health.\"\nShe thinks the idea of banning adverts showing models with bigger bodies is a symptom of society's \"fat phobia\".\nOf her 100 staff, 12 are dedicated \"just to remove negative comments and big up those promoting body positivity\".\n\"Fat people exist, they're equally as valid as thin people, they buy clothes and they need to see what they look like on people that look like them,\" she says.\n\"You are not worth less the bigger you are. Models of all sizes, shapes, ethnicities and abilities are valid and should be represented.\"\nSophie Scott is a 27-year-old salon owner from Lossiemouth in Scotland who has modelled for Snag, and received positive and negative comments about her size on social media.\n\"I get either 'you're so beautiful' or 'you need to lose weight'. When I started modelling I was a size 30. Having lost weight since then I'm still on the receiving end of hate comments because it will never be enough for some people.\"\nSophie is used to online comments telling her she is \"unhealthy\", but says, \"fitness is not measured by the way you look. They are making assumptions, they don't know me or my activity levels.\n\"People say 'you're glorifying obesity' but I don't think anyone is looking at me and saying 'I want to look like that'.

We know people with eating disorders seek out images of very thin people as 'thinspiration'. But if anyone sees a picture of a bigger person they're not going to drive to buy 10 McDonald's to try to get fatter.\"\nJess Tye at the ASA told the BBC the watchdog gets about 35,000 complaints a year about all advertising, and in 2024 received 61 complaints about 52 adverts relating to the model's weight.\nShe says an advert will be investigated if it could be seen to be encouraging people to aspire to an unhealthy body weight. Adverts simply promoting body confidence and using a model who is relevant to the product's size range would not be investigated.\n\"It's to do with the wider societal context.

        "article_text": "The live-action version of the classic fairy-tale animation sounded like a surefire hit. But even before it's reached cinemas, the response to it has been loud and often hostile.\nYou wouldn't think that the war in Gaza would have much impact on a Disney remake. But the live-action Snow White, a revamped version of the 1937 animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, has become a flashpoint for social and political divisions, even before its global release next week. \u00a0\nThere was some backlash to the casting of Rachel Zegler, of Colombian descent, as the heroine. More recently, there has been blowback both about Zegler's pro-Palestinian comments and about pro-Israel comments by Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen. And there is an ongoing debate about whether there should have been dwarfs at all, live or CGI. The film's director, Marc Webb, said in Disney's official production notes, \"I think all good stories evolve over time. They become reflections of the world that we live in\". He has likely got more than he bargained for, as reactions to Snow White inadvertently reflect the most polarised aspects of the world today. Like political rhetoric in countries around the world, responses to the film's production have been loud, irate and sometimes ugly.\nSnow White has been in the works since 2019, and began in earnest with Zegler's casting in 2021. Since then attacks on its so-called \"wokeness\" have proliferated, making the film a lightning rod for opinions that have little to do with the fairy tale it is based on. A recent Hollywood Reporter article asked, \"Have some PR missteps combined with anti-woke outrage turned marketing the film into a poisoned apple?\" And alongside such measured reporting there have been heated responses in the media. The editorial board of the New York Post \u2013 owned by Rupert Murdoch, the conservative mogul whose company also owns Fox News \u2013 weighed in this week, declaring the film a financial disaster before it has opened, writing: \"Disney 'Snow White' controversy proves it again: Go woke, go broke!\"\nThe original film needed an update if it was going to be remade at all. In its day it set a high bar for Disney's future animated films, but it also introduced the song Someday My Prince Will Come, blighting the expectations of generations of girls by setting them up to wait for a Prince Charming to make their lives complete. Meanwhile, Snow White happily sweeps the floor for the dwarfs until he shows up to rescue her with a kiss after she bites the Queen's poisoned apple. Soon after her casting announcement, Zegler told the television show Extra that in the old Snow White \"there was a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her\". In fact, the original film states that he \"searched far and wide\" to find her after falling in love at first sight, and he disappears for most of the film, so no need to take that comment too seriously. Zegler was excited and laughing when she said it. But in an early sign of the blinkered reactions to come, social media posts complained that she was anti-love.\nSome people also rejected the idea that a Latina actress could play a character called Snow White; alongside criticisms of such non-traditional casting, she was subject to racist trolling. This was a similar reaction to that experienced by the black actress Halle Bailey when she was cast as Ariel in 2023's The Little Mermaid.\nThe film stumbled into more trouble simply because its lead actresses expressed political opinions. On X in August 2024, Zegler thanked fans for the response to the Snow White trailer, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".\nGadot has posted her support for Israel on social media, and especially since the 7 October attacks by Hamas has been outspoken in defence of her country and against anti-semitism. That led to some short-lived calls by pro-Palestinian social media users to boycott the film simply because she is in it.\nThe fallout on the film intensified after the 2024 US presidential election. Zegler posted on Instagram that she was \"heartbroken\" and fearful, and that she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\". In response Megyn Kelly, the former Fox news personality, attacked Zegler, saying on her radio show, \"This woman is a pig,\" and that Disney was going to have to recast the role. Zegler apologised to Trump voters, saying \"I let my emotions get the best of me\".\nEven when people reacting to the film have agreed on a basic principle, like more opportunities for actors who have dwarfism, they have disagreed on how to get there. Peter Dinklage, perhaps the world's most well-known actor with dwarfism, questioned the entire project before many details were known, calling the 1937 film \"a backwards story of seven dwarfs living in a cave together\". Disney announced the next day, \"To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters.\"\nAs it turned out, the seven characters are CGI, and Disney has reclassifed them as \"magical creatures\", not dwarfs. What do they look like? Even a glimpse at the trailer reveals that they look exactly like CGI dwarfs. They are still named Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful and Dopey.\nThe changes have caused a backlash from some people with dwarfism, who have rebutted Dinklage and accused Disney of depriving them of acting roles. As recently as this week, one told the Daily Mail, \"I think Disney is trying too hard to be politically correct, but in doing so it's damaging our careers and opportunities.\" \nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 of the best films to watch this March\n\u2022\u00a0The real meaning of Wicked\n\u2022\u00a0Why Disney had a hard centenary year\nAmidst this swirl of controversies, Disney altered the traditional red-carpet treatment it would usually give such a major film. The premiere took place in Spain on 12 March, and the Los Angeles premiere is due to take place today at an unusual, afternoon hour. The regular red-carpet journalists have not been invited, even though as a group they are not known to ask hard-hitting questions.\nTrying to avoid more political and social discord isn't Disney's only Snow White problem, though. There is much online speculation that the film might just be bad. The first full trailer was greeted with a rush of complaints about the underwhelming CGI, with The Guardian calling the trailer \"the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\". The film has new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the team behind La La Land, but the one released as a video, Waiting On a Wish, has a bland, generic Disney style. Box-office tracking predicts an opening weekend of around $50m (\u00a339m), solid but at the low end for a would-be blockbuster that reportedly cost over $200m (\u00a3155m) to make.\nOf course, given the Disney juggernaut \u2013 the recent Moana 2 has made more than $1bn (\u00a3773m) and Mufasa: The Lion King, which had a slow start, more than $712m (\u00a3550m) \u2013 the debacle leading up to Snow White's opening may not hurt it at the box office at all.\nOr the film may become the victim of its moment, a fairy-tale princess covered in mud.\u00a0\nSnow White is released internationally on March 21\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

A year removed from a historic series success in New Zealand and six months on from completing the Grand Slam on home soil, it felt as though the squad were peaking at the right time. \nIt proved a false dawn. Johnny Sexton, the heartbeat of Irish rugby, was denied a fairytale ending to his Test career. Eighteen months on, three of his long-time team-mates - Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray - bow out amid a feeling of what might have been. \nAnd the curtain closing on three more illustrious careers in green brings into focus the need for Ireland to evolve. \nEven before the France game, Paul O'Connell admitted the squad will encounter \"days when we struggle\" given the experience drain. \nAnd while striking a more positive note, Caelan Doris hammered home the need for improvement on the road ahead as he recapped his first Six Nations as captain on Saturday. \n\"There are obviously lots of things we can learn and grow from over the last couple of weeks and I hope that it will be a springboard for us as a group to go on and continue to evolve, and a bit of a realisation that there's still a lot of work to be done and a lot in us,\" said the Irish skipper. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders\nFor the first time in 14 years, O'Mahony will not be part of that work. \nHaving poured his lot into the Irish cause over a career that yielded 114 caps and five Six Nations titles - including one as captain - the Munster great is looking forward to watching games from the stands with his family. \nAnd as he bows out, O'Mahony - as well-placed as anyone to comment on the health of Irish rugby - insists the team is still in \"incredible shape\" despite a third-place finish, considering where they have come from. \nO'Mahony, of course, was one of the last links to the darker days, pointing to the famous 2013 loss to Italy in Rome. \nIreland finished fifth that year, but rebuilt impressively under Joe Schmidt after Declan Kidney's departure, capturing back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015 before the Grand Slam three years later.\n\"Now the expectation of everyone in Ireland when we take to the pitch is that we win,\" said O'Mahony, who received a rapturous ovation when he replaced Josh van der Flier after 51 minutes against Italy.\n\"The expectation when we start the Six Nations is that we win the Six Nations. That's down to the hard work of the players. We've gone from hoping to expecting. Over the space of a decade or so, we've changed the mindset of players and supporters to expect nothing but wins from Ireland. \n\"That group is one of the most talented you'll ever come across from an Irish point of view. I look at the younger players I've been lucky enough to play alongside over the past eight weeks, it's getting better and better. \n\"It gives me a huge amount of pride, Cian [Healy] spoke inside about leaving a mark on the younger players and if I've made a little difference or shown them a few things not to do, I'd be a happy man.\"\nProp Jack Boyle was the only Ireland debutant during this year's Six Nations\nThe pain of relinquishing their Six Nations crown will be acute in the days ahead, but Ireland have much to look forward to in the remainder of 2025. \nHowever, before a Chicago rematch against the All Blacks and mouthwatering Dublin Tests against Australia and South Africa in November, interim boss Simon Easterby will oversee a summer tour. \nWhile the details have not been confirmed, matches against Georgia, Romania and Portugal have been mooted. \nRegardless of the opponents, though, it will be a crucial period as Easterby looks to future-proof the squad and introduce new talent to the international game while his frontline players are on the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. \nSince last year's Six Nations triumph, Ireland have blooded Jamie Osborne, Tom Clarkson, Sam Prendergast, Cormac Izuchukwu, Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle. \nBut outside of the retiring O'Mahony and Conor Murray, 10 of Ireland's 23 against Italy are at least 30 years of age, highlighting the need for squad progression. \nSummer tours on Lions years have in the past been fertile ground for Ireland. The 2017 tour to Japan, for example, marked the emergence of Jacob Stockdale, Andrew Porter and James Ryan. \nWhether or not Ireland uncover a similar calibre of player this year remains to be seen, but there appears an acknowledgement of the need to deepen the squad before Andy Farrell's return from Lions duty. \nNow the work must start.",

        "article_text": "Custard powder makes a delicious dessert but also has a rather less savoury potential \u2013 in certain conditions, it can be a powerful explosive.\nInstant custard powder is a staple of many kitchens. Just add water and heat, and the powdery mixture of cornstarch and flavourings will transform into an unctuous treat. It's hard to imagine anything more inoffensive. But on 18 November 1981, at the Bird's Custard factory in Oxfordshire, the substance showed its dark side. A hopper of powder overflowed, and the resulting dust cloud ignited, exploding into flame.\nNine people were injured in the explosion. They were lucky \u2013 powder explosions can be lethal. Fourteen people were killed in Minnesota in 1871 when a flour mill went up. Forty-four people, including a child, lost their lives to a cornstarch-based explosion in 1919 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which levelled part of the town. \"The main explosion seemed to lift great buildings and hold them in tension for a moment, letting them drop with their own weight,\" one observer wrote later.\nDust explosions, of various substances, have continued to take lives \u2013 in 2014, 97 people died when dust in a factory in Kunshan, China, ignited. In 2022, one industry report counted 50 such explosions globally, although not all of them involved foodstuffs.\nHow can the makings for a simple dessert cause carnage, though? In all dust explosions, there are a few common factors. The powder must be made of a flammable substance \u2013 that means you're safe from sand, which is made of minerals like silica. But flour, cornstarch, sugar, coal dust, powdered plastic, and aluminium powder can all burn, meaning that if they get airborne, the risk for a truly devastating explosion goes up.\nThat's because, suspended in a cloud, all those particles have an enormous surface area exposed to oxygen. That makes them swift to combust. If a few of them heat up to ignition \u2013 and in each of these cases, there was a source of heat like friction or static electricity involved \u2013 then the fire can spread almost instantaneously to the rest of the cloud. Like a pile of confetti ignited in a fireplace, suspended dust burns fast.\nThat evening at the Bird's Custard factory, there were 20 workers on duty. Several noticed that cornstarch was pouring out of the top of one of the bins, according to the accident report. \"At this point several witnesses saw a flash near the top of the bin and a wall of flame spreading outwards and downwards from the bin top,\" the report continues. \"Descriptions were of a gale-force wind with a flame front behind, which flashed through the area.\" Later inspection revealed that the machinery meant to pour cornstarch into various bins had malfunctioned, so cornstarch continued to pour into the container until it overflowed.\u00a0\u00a0\nKeeping the risk of such explosions down means coming at the problem from many angles \u2013 grounding all the machines in a factory to reduce static electricity, building in filtration systems that remove dust from the air, and diligent patrolling for any dust build-up are all recommended by health and safety agencies.\nLook at a spoonful of cornstarch or custard powder, and it is nearly impossible to imagine it as an engine of destruction. Very few of us have any direct experience of these events, so it is hard to see these substances the way you might see a sheet of paper held near a candle, or a cigarette smouldering by a pile of leaves, as an accident waiting to happen.\u00a0\nThere are situations in which you might encounter this dangerous chemistry in real life, however, outside of a custard factory or flour silo.\nParties in which coloured powder, often cornstarch, is shot into crowds, inspired by the Hindu festival of Holi, are popular spring-time events. In 2015, at a water park in Taiwan, coloured cornstarch sprayed over a concert audience ignited, provoking a maelstrom in which more than 500 people were injured. Twenty people died as a result of their injuries.\nMore like this\n\u2022\u00a0The odd-tasting oil that packed a healthy punch\n\u2022\u00a0What we owe the humble lentil\n\u2022\u00a0Gelatine: the ingredient with the wonder wobble\nThe park's management stated that they had no knowledge that such explosive fires were possible as a result of cornstarch clouds. In fact, coloured powders are often sold with labels incorrectly marking them as non-flammable, a team of scientists found in 2023 when they tested the combustible qualities of various powders.\nAt Bird's Custard, that day in 1981, the wall of flame thankfully did not kick up any dust that could have provoked a secondary explosion. But it's not uncommon for dust explosions to go from bad to worse as lingering dust is kicked up and rises into the air. The only way to prevent these disasters is to pre-empt them, say consultants who assess the risks for companies.\nKeep spaces where powders are used clean, patrol for sources of heat and, above all, have a healthy respect for the destructive potential in innocent, edible powder like custard.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "A fashion show held last week in a picturesque, snow-clad town in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked a major controversy that is still simmering.\nThe show, by the well-known fashion brand Shivan & Narresh, was held last Friday at a ski resort in Gulmarg to display their skiwear collection. The label is the first big, non-local brand to hold a fashion show in Kashmir, a scenic Himalayan region which has seen decades of violence.\nBut it soon sparked outrage among locals, politicians and religious leaders in Muslim-majority Kashmir after fashion publisher Elle India posted a video on social media which showed some models wearing underwear or bikinis. Locals were also angry over another video - shared by online magazine Lifestyle Asia - of a party held after the show, which showed people drinking alcohol outdoors.\nMany took offence with the show being held in the holy month of Ramadan - a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims - and accused the designers of \"mocking their faith\" and \"disregarding local culture and sentiments\". Some clerics called the show \"obscene\" and said it was like \"soft porn\". \nSome others explained that the outrage had arisen not only from religious conservatism, but also from a fear of cultural imposition from \"outsiders\". Kashmir has witnessed decades of armed separatist insurgency against Indian rule since the late 1980s. \nThe backlash prompted Elle India and Lifestyle Asia to delete their videos. Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja, the designers behind the label, also apologised, saying that their \"sole intention was to celebrate creativity\" and that they didn't intend to offend religious sentiments.\nKashmir - known as the land of saints and Sufism (Islamic mysticism) - has a rich tradition of spirituality which influences many aspects of peoples' lives. The traditional attire is modest, with locals - both men and women - often wearing the pheran, a long, loose cloak.\nThe row also moved off social media and a discussion about the show and the after-party caused a ruckus in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly.\nThe opposition criticised the government, accusing it of giving permission for the event despite being aware of local sensitivities. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah distanced his government from the event, saying it had been organised by private entities, and asking local authorities to investigate the matter and submit a report.\n\"If law has been violated, strict action will be taken,\" he said in the assembly on Monday. The police have not yet given details about who organised the event and what laws, if any, have been violated.\nThe fashion brand did not respond to the BBC's questions about the show, including about permissions it obtained.\nIt's not surprising that scenic Gulmarg - one of India's few skiing destinations and a favourite with tourists - was the choice of venue for a show highlighting a skiwear collection.\nFashion journalist Shefalee Vasudev says it's not uncommon for designers to want to hold fashion shows in exquisite locations.\nIn fact, international designers like Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld are remembered as much for their creative, theatrical fashion shows as they are for their iconic designs.\nBut experimentation brings with it the risk of controversy and so, it's important to be mindful of the political and cultural sensitivities of a place, Ms Vasudev told the BBC.\nAnd this holds especially true in a place like Kashmir, which has witnessed wars and decades of armed conflict.\nBoth India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the territory.\nThousands of people have been killed since the late 1980s, when a separatist insurgency broke out against Indian rule. Though the separatist movement has lost steam over the years, many locals continue to view the administration in Delhi with distrust.\nThese sentiments have deepened since 2019 when the federal government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, stripped the region of its autonomy.\nSo some locals told the BBC that they were not surprised by the reactions to the show.\n\"Everything in Kashmir is political; people see things through a political prism,\" says Mir, a professor at a local university (he asked for his surname to be withheld to protect his identity). He adds that people are sceptical about big corporate events like the fashion show and - even if they are organised by private players - they believe that the government is trying to dilute their culture.\nArshid Ahmad, a researcher, uses stronger words to express public angst. \"The government is trying to dilute the spirit of resistance in Kashmiris,\" he says.\nThis isn't the first time an event held by non-locals has triggered a controversy in Kashmir. In 2013, separatists and human rights activists in the region protested against a show by renowned conductor Zubin Mehta. They said it was an attempt by the government to show the world that all was well in Kashmir when people were \"suffering and dying\".\nSome of the recent apprehensions around culture and identity can also be tied to the increase in tourists to Kashmir from other states in India. The federal government has often connected this boom in tourism to the abrogation of Article 370, which stripped the region of its autonomy.\nNousheen Fatima, 34, says because of government messaging, people outside Kashmir now see the region as being safer and \"more assimilated with India\". But she alleges that many tourists do not respect the region's culture.\nLast year, a video showing tourists drinking alcohol during a boat ride on the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar evoked outrage from political and religious leaders, who called the behaviour \"un-Islamic and unethical\".\nIn February, locals put up posters in Srinagar, asking tourists to \"respect local culture and traditions\" and \"avoid alcohol and use of drugs\", but these were later pulled down by the police.\nIn an editorial for The Voice of Fashion magazine, Ms Vasudev argues that the outrage needs to be examined from a critical lens. She asks if it would have been all right for the show to have been held in another Indian city instead of Kashmir, where Muslims would also be observing Ramadan. And whether it would have been acceptable to hold the show in Kashmir if it featured only outfits perceived as modest.\nShe also points out that Kashmir is home to the \"world's finest wool yarn; some of the finest handspun, handwoven pashmina creations and its artisans\".\n\"What Kashmir creates and stands for cannot be replicated anywhere. Shouldn't a fashion show at Gulmarg then, with innovative garments made with 100% wool, be seen as regenerating interest in untried ways?\" she asks.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never intended to stay for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to be just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected.\u00a0\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stayed for longer.\u00a0\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days\u00a0living aboard the\u00a0American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\nHis time in orbit \u2013 which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days \u2013 was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space \u2013 a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in\u00a0a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is\u00a0expected to take around 1,100 days\u00a0(just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\nMuscles and bones\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\nSimilarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth.\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\nWeight loss\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit \u2013 the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\nEyesight\nOn Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent.\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\nNeural shuffling\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function \u2013 in other words, movement \u2013 and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\nFriendly bacteria\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\nResearchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.)\nSkin\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers \u2013 like Rubio, who spent one year in space \u2013 will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\nThere were also some changes in gene expression \u2013 the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells \u2013 seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system\u00a0was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n* This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

        "article_text": "At the toughest, most turbulent time of his life, the Post-Impressionist painter was supported by an unlikely soulmate, Joseph Roulin, a postman in Arles. A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin\u2026 has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition\u00a0Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him \u2013 this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits \u2013 the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Caf\u00e9 de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the caf\u00e9, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness,\u00a0despair\u00a0and\u00a0impending doom\u00a0seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who\u00a0described him\u00a0as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter \u2013 on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\u2022\u00a0Six Nordic paintings that help us rethink winter\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice \u2013 on furnishing the yellow house for example \u2013 and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good\u00a0Doctor\u00a0and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours \u2013 green, blue, yellow or red \u2013 vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection \u2013 a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process \u2013 and his ways of creating connection \u2013 will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The White House has denied an accusation from rights groups that it flouted due process by defying a judge's order while carrying out deportations at the weekend.\nA group of 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members, plus 23 alleged members of the international MS-13 gang, were sent from the US to a prison in El Salvador. Some were removed from the country under a law not invoked since World War Two.\nThe move came despite a temporary block issued by a judge. The White House said the judge's order itself was not lawful and was issued after the group was deported.\nNeither the US government nor El Salvador has identified the detainees, or provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.\nAnnouncing the move on Saturday, the day after he signed it, Trump accused the gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".\nHe cited the Alien Enemies Act - a piece of legislation that dates to 1798, which was designed to allow non-citizens to be deported in times of war or invasion. Campaigners have questioned Trump's justification.\nThe act was used to process 137 of the total of 261 people who were deported, the White House said on Monday. \nThe basis on which the other deportees were removed from the US remains unclear, and details of the group as a whole have not been disclosed.\nSeveral relatives of men believed to be among the group told the New York Times that their loved ones did not have gang ties. \nThe White House, for its part, has insisted that authorities are \"sure\" that the detainees were gang members, based on intelligence. \nThe case raises constitutional questions since, under the US system of checks and balances, government agencies are expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.\nA hearing to ascertain more information about the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act is taking place on Monday afternoon. \nThe order to halt the deportations came from US District Judge James Boasberg on Saturday evening, who demanded a 14-day pause pending further legal arguments.\nAfter lawyers told him that planes with deportees had already taken off, the judge reportedly gave a verbal order for the flights to turn back, although that directive did not form part of his written ruling.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the court ruling had been broken. \n\"The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" she said. \"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from US territory.\"\nThe justice department echoed Leavitt, saying the deportees had already left before the judge's ruling - which it has appealed against.\nBut a timeline of events reported by US media suggests the Trump administration appears to have had the opportunity to stop at least some of the deportations.\nTrump's border tsar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump did \"exactly the right thing\". \n\"The plane was already over international waters with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats,\" he said. \"We removed terrorists. That should be celebrated in this country.\" \nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed the arrival of deportees. \"Oopsie... Too late,\" he said of the judge's order, writing on social media. His team also published footage of some of the men inside one of its mega-jails.\nAccording to the White House, El Salvador's government received $6m (\u00a34.62m) to take the detainees, which Leavitt said \"is pennies on the dollar\" compared to the cost of confining them in US prisons. \nRights groups accused Trump of using a 227-year-old law to circumvent due process.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) questioned Trump's use of a sweeping wartime authority which allows fast-track deportations. \"I think we're in very dangerous territory here in the United States with the invocation of this law,\" said Lee Gelernt from the organisation.\nThe Alien Enemies Act only allowed deportations when the US was in a declared war with that foreign government, or was being invaded, Mr Gelernt said. \"A gang is not invading,\" he told BBC News. \nThe act was last used during World War Two to intern Japanese-American civilians.\nMaking matters worse was the fact \"the administration is saying nobody can review what they're doing\", Mr Gelernt added.\nMeanwhile, Amnesty International USA said the deportations were \"yet another example of the Trump administration's racist targeting\" of Venezuelans \"based on sweeping claims of gang affiliation\".\nVenezuela itself criticised Trump, saying he \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\".\nThe latest deportations under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running campaign against illegal immigration.  \nThe US president has also moved to strengthen ties with El Salvador.\nThe two gangs targeted with the weekend deportations were declared \"foreign terrorist organisations\" by Trump after returning to the White House in January.",

        "article_text": "In Japan, a smelly waste product is being reimagined as a potential clean fuel of the future that is powering cars and tractors.\nWe're being eyed suspiciously by dozens of cows. Their breath fogs cartoonishly from their nostrils.\nIt's a brisk morning in snowy Hokkaido, an island in the north of Japan. The cold air carries the distinct scent of cow manure \u2013 a smelly yet familiar side-effect of the region's thriving dairy industry. Accounting for 20% of the country's landmass, this island is the second-largest in Japan. It's also home to over a million cows, which produce over half of the country's milk and dairy products.\nWe are visiting one farm in Hokkaido that wants to transform the source of the pungent aroma in the air into something valuable. They are turning cattle manure into hydrogen.\u00a0\nWhen it is burned, hydrogen does not emit carbon, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. There are widespread hopes it could be used as a sustainable fuel to heat homes and power cars, trains, aircraft and ships in the future.\nBut the most common way of producing hydrogen today involves using methane \u2013 a fossil fuel piped up from deep underground, meaning it is still associated with significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.\nThe Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source \u2013 a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. Around 20 million tonnes of cow manure is generated in Hokkaido annually. If not treated correctly, it can be an environmental burden, producing significant methane emissions as well as affecting water quality if allowed to leak into streams and rivers. So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?\n\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. We are visiting the facility in Shikaoi, a town in central Hokkaido, to film an upcoming episode of the BBC's TechXplore focusing on Japan. \"Shikaoi accounts for 30% of Hokkaido\u2019s cow waste and urine, so it has great potential for renewable energy.\"\nLaunched in 2015 by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, the project aims to convert agricultural by-products into hydrogen to supply the local, rural community in a circular economy.\u00a0The cow excrement and urine is collected from local dairy farms before being fed into a anaerobic digester at a central facility. Here bacteria break down the organic waste to produce biogas and a liquid fertiliser. The biogas is then purified into methane that is used to manufacture hydrogen.\nThe plant now has a hydrogen production capacity of 70 cubic metres (18,500 gallons), with an onsite fuelling station that can fill around 28 vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells per day, says Abe. Although the fuel can be used by cars with fuel cells, the plant's fuelling station has been specially designed to accommodate agricultural vehicles such as tractors and forklift trucks. These farm vehicles are difficult to electrify with batteries due to their size and the type of work they do. The hydrogen-powered vehicles are used around the farms' sites, reducing the emissions that would otherwise be created by using other fuel sources.\u00a0\nCattle-made-hydrogen is also stored in canisters that are transported to provide power and heat to other facilities in the area, including a local sturgeon fish farm and the nearby Obihiro Zoo.\nBut hydrogen isn't without its problems. It needs to be stored in high-pressure tanks as a gas, and can be prone to leakage due to its low molecular weight. It can also degrade metal storage containers, leaving them embrittled, and is easily ignited and so requires additional safety precautions when handling it.\nHydrogen can also be stored as a liquid by chilling it to cryogenic temperatures of below \u2013253C (-423F), but this can be energy intensive and requires large amounts of additional infrastructure.\nHydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of petrol (gasoline) when taken by mass alone. But its low molecular weight also means that by volume, the energy packed into a litre of liquid hydrogen is a quarter that of petrol. Put simply, as the lightest gas in the Universe, hydrogen takes up more space kilogram for kilogram than petrol. This means a lot more storage space is needed for hydrogen compared to fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and natural gas. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.\nBut as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.\nHokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.\nUsing agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses\u00a0the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Here, steam heated to 800C (1,472F) reacts with the methane to produce hydrogen, along with the byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO2).\u00a0\nIn the case of cow manure, however, says Abe, the project remains sustainable as this carbon originated in the grass the cows grazed on: \"Since it was originally in the atmosphere, it is considered carbon neutral.\"\nIn addition, it helps to prevent the methane that would otherwise have been emitted from the manure from getting into the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas.\nLeftover slurry from the manure after the biogas has been extracted is sprayed as fertiliser onto nearby fields, while formic acid \u2013 which is both used in and created by the processes \u2013 could be offered as a preservative for cattle feed, says Abe.\u00a0\nCurrently, the electricity needed to produce and store the hydrogen comes from the national grid. But Abe says there's potential to shift to green energy, given Hokkaido\u2019s promising sea, wind and geothermal potential, thus reducing the carbon emissions of this electricity.\nStill, other challenges remain. The high cost of the hydrogen compared to fossil fuels and low demand mean expanding the operation is difficult.\u00a0\n\"The construction costs of hydrogen stations are very high,\" says Abe. \"Since hydrogen vehicles are not yet widespread, we're keeping our filling capacity low to manage initial investment. As adoption increases, we'll expand supply.\"\nTo encourage hydrogen vehicle adoption in the area, hydrogen prices are subsidised by the plant, matching the cost of petrol. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.\nHype Meter\nThe process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure. With other countries exploring how to use other types of waste, from pig dung to coconut husks, to produce hydrogen using similar processes, it appears this could be a model adaptable to other local contexts.\nWith the scale still small, however, and costs of production high, it remains to be seen how widespread this industry can be. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen.\u00a0\nJapan is the world leader in hydrogen vehicles and has invested considerably in developing the technology. But for now battery-powered electric vehicles remain cheaper than hydrogen powered ones.\nThough it's unlikely that cow manure alone will ever meet Japan's hydrogen demand, it could contribute significantly, and Shikaoi is creating a model for a circular economy that it hopes will show how costs can fall with the economies of scale.\u00a0\nAnd there is growing interest in other parts of the world in using waste materials to produce hydrogen, with pig dung, poultry waste and even coconut husks having been explored as potential feedstocks. In Thailand, vehicle manufacturer Toyota is even exploring the use of hydrogen made from chicken waste to fuel its vehicles.\nMeanwhile, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago in the US recently developed another promising method to make hydrogen involving manure. In their case, they used the manure, along with sugarcane waste and corn husks, to make biochar, a carbon-rich substance which vastly reduces the amount of electricity needed to convert water to hydrogen.\n\"We are the first group to show that you can produce hydrogen utilising biomass at a fraction of a volt,\" says Meenesh Singh, a chemical engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago who led the project.\nIn the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, on Kyushu, meanwhile, another waste product is being used to produce hydrogen \u2013 and here the dung is from humans.\nFor more than a decade, hydrogen has been created at the city's sewage treatment plant for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Most recently it has been used to fuel a fleet of zero-emission rubbish trucks.\nAkira Miyaoka, hydrogen utilisation manager for Fukuoka City, says trucks that transport daily products are the town's main source of CO2, rather than large factories as in many other cities. \"So we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from commercial trucks,\" she says.\nThe initiative started as a collaboration between Kyushu University and Fukuoka City, but now involves several major companies including Toyota.\n\"Sewage is something that is steadily discharged every day in the daily lives of citizens, so by making effective use of that sewage and extracting hydrogen as energy, we can achieve local production and local consumption of energy,\" says Miyaoka.\u00a0\nGenerating hydrogen from human waste starts with water from various household sources \u2013 including showers, dishwashers and toilets \u2013 arriving at the treatment plant. As the water is cleaned, the residual sludge is kept as a source of biogas and converted into hydrogen.\u00a0\n\"Sewage and biogas contain various impurities, so the process begins with the process of removing those impurities, which I think is a little different from other hydrogen production processes,\" says Miyaoka.\nIn 2024, Toyota helped the city launch Japan\u2019s first hydrogen-powered service vehicle fleet, including ambulances, delivery vans and bin trucks. Officials at the sewage treatment plant say it is capable of producing 300kg (661lbs) of hydrogen in 12 hours \u2013 enough to fuel 30 trucks.\u00a0\nThe rubbish trucks head out six nights each week, each collecting 1.7 tonnes (3,700lb) of rubbish, all while running silently and emission-free on the bodily waste of the people they are collecting other waste from.\nFukuoka's sewage-to-hydrogen fuelling station has been around since 2015, and several other countries around the world are now adopting a similar approach.\nConcord Blue has developed waste-to-energy plants in Germany, India, Japan and the US, converting waste and biomass into hydrogen and bioenergy. Several water authorities in the UK are also working on projects to derive hydrogen from sewage.\nA prototype race car has also been developed using sewage-derived hydrogen in the UK. The Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), in partnership with Severn Trent Water, is harnessing microbes that generate hydrogen fuel from waste. They anticipate the technology could hit the mainstream within five years, despite existing challenges. (Read about how sewage-powered cars could be the future of motorsport.)\nOn a larger scale, aviation accounts for 2% of global carbon emissions, and researchers in a UK lab have developed jet fuel made entirely from human sewage.\nStill, despite the promise, all of these technologies have yet to be delivered at significant scale.\nWhether in rural or city landscapes, the Japanese projects we've seen during in filming are inspiring because they have the local community at their heart.\nWhile adoption of hydrogen cars has stalled, hydrogen truck adoption is increasing gradually and it is these larger heavier industrial vehicles that contribute most significantly per vehicle to greenhouse gas emissions.\nBy reimagining waste as a resource, these projects demonstrate that energy can be found in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Paul Carter is the presenter of TechXplore.

        "summary": "So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?The Japanese farm turning cow manure into hydrogen fuel\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.But as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.Hokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.Using agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses\u00a0the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.The Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source \u2013 a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.Hype MeterThe process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure.",

        "article_text": "After Kim Visintine put her son to bed every night at a hospital in St Louis, Missouri, she spent her evening in the hospital\u2019s library. She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old.\n\"Doctors were shocked,\" she says. \"We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs.\"\nKim\u2019s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45. \nZack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old.\nYears later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek.\nIn this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s. \nA compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area. \nThis Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024.\nBenefits were paid to such neighbours, frequently called \"downwinders\", in Arizona, Utah and Nevada, but not New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure.\nSt Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. After World War Two ended, the chemical was dumped near the creek and left uncovered, allowing waste to seep into the area.\nDecades later, federal investigators acknowledged an increased cancer risk for some people who played in the creek as children, but added in their report: \"The predicted increases in the number of cancer cases from exposures are small, and no method exists to link a particular cancer with this exposure.\"\nThe clean-up of the creek is still ongoing and is not expected to finish until 2038.\nA new bill has been put forward in the House, and Josh Hawley, a US senator representing Missouri, says he has raised the issue with President Donald Trump. \nWhen Kim flicks through her school yearbook, she can identify those who have become sick and those who have since passed away. The numbers are startling.\n\"My husband didn\u2019t grow up in this area, and he said to me, 'Kim, this is not normal. It seems like we\u2019re always talking about one of your friends passing away or going to a funeral',\" she says.\nJust streets away from the creek, Karen Nickel grew up spending her days near the water picking berries, or in the nearby park playing baseball. Her brother would often try and catch fish in Coldwater Creek.\n\"I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America,\" says Karen. \"Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night.\"\nBut years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different.\n\"Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers,\" she says. \"We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can\u2019t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this.\"\nWhen Karen\u2019s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen\u2019s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary.\nKaren helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area.\n\"We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure,\" she says. \"These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases.\"\nTeresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases.\nYears later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up. \nThat does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected. \n\"ALS took my sister at 50,\" Teresa says. \"I think it was the worst disease ever of mankind. When she was diagnosed in 2019, she\u2019d just got her career going and her children were growing. She stayed positive through all of it.\"\nLike Hawley, Just STL Moms and other community members want the government's compensation act to be expanded to include people within the St Louis area, despite the programme being in limbo after expiring.\nExpanding it to the Coldwater Creek community would mean that locals could be offered compensation if they could prove they were harmed as a result of the Manhattan Project, during which the atomic bomb was developed with the help of uranium-processing in St Louis. It would also allow screenings and further study into illnesses other than cancer. \nIn a statement to the BBC, the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it took concerns very seriously and had actively worked with federal, state and local partners - as well as community members - to understand their health concerns, and to ensure community members were not exposed to the Manhattan Project-era waste.\nThe BBC has also contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the clean-up - but has not received a response to a request for comment.\n\"My sister would have loved to be part of the fight. She\u2019d be the first to picket,\" says Teresa of her efforts to get greater support from the government.\nThe trend in people around Coldwater Creek getting unwell has not gone unnoticed among healthcare professionals.\nDr Gautum Agarwal, a cancer surgeon at Mercy Hospital in St Louis, says he has not noticed a \"statistical thing\", but notes that he has seen husbands and wives and their neighbours presenting cancers.\nNow, he ensures that his patients are asked where they live and how close they are to Coldwater Creek.\n\"I tell them that there\u2019s a potential that there\u2019s a link. And if your neighbours or family live near there, we should get them screened more often. And maybe you should get your kids screened earlier.\"\nHe hopes that over time more knowledge will be gained about the issue, and for a study into multi-cancer early detection tests to be introduced that could help catch any potential cancers, and help reassure people in the area.\nOther experts take a different view of the risks. \"There is a narrative that many people are sick from cancers, specifically from exposures while living next to Coldwater Creek for the last few decades\", says Roger Lewis, a professor in the environmental and occupations health department of St Louis University. \n\"But the data and studies don't indicate that. They show that there is some risk but it's small. It doesn't mean that it's not significant in some ways, but it's very limited.\" \nProf Lewis acknowledges the fear in the community, saying locals will feel safer if the government is clearer about its efforts  to eliminate any hazards. \nFor many people near Coldwater Creek, conversation with authorities is not easing the angst that comes with living in an area known for the dumping of nuclear waste.\n\"It\u2019s almost a given in our community that at some point we all expect to have some sort of cancer or illness,\u201d says Kim Visintine. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this apathy within our group that, well, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\"\nCorrection 16 March: This article originally reported that the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act covered parts of New Mexico. It has been amended to show that benefits were paid under the act to people in Arizona, Nevada and Utah, but not in New Mexico.",

        "article_text": "In 2019, climate scientist Steffen Olsen took a startling photo of huskies appearing to walk on water. The photo quickly went viral as it revealed the reality of Greenland's rapidly melting ice.\nIn June 2019, a striking image of husky dogs apparently walking on water in Greenland stunned the world and quickly went viral.\nThe photo was taken by Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute and lead of Blue Action, a European project which investigates the effect of a changing Arctic on weather and climate.\n\"The reaction surprised me,\" says Olsen. \"It surprised me that so many people saw this as a beautiful photo. I saw it as a scary situation.\"\nThat's because the dogs were in fact wading through ankle-deep meltwater on top of sea ice in Inglefield Bredning, an 80km-long (49.7 miles) system in northwestern Greenland.\n\"I learned to see the photo as an illusion. People don't see sea ice, but dogs walking on water,\" Olsen says.\u00a0\nOlsen captured the photo while travelling with a team of scientists who were monitoring sea and ice conditions near the town of Qaanaaq, one of the world's most northerly towns. They were retrieving scientific instruments they had deployed during the winter.\u00a0\n\"We had been travelling for some hours and it became clear that the melting was very extreme\u2026 [the ice] more or less melted beneath our feet while we were travelling on it,\" says Olsen. \"The local hunters and I were very surprised\u2026 we were searching for dry spots to get the dogs and the sleds out of the water and there were none in sight. We turned around and made it back to the coast.\"\nThe dogs are typically very hesitant to get their paws wet, says Olsen. \"Usually when we meet water, it's because there are cracks in the sea ice and the dogs have to jump over the water\u2026they hate it. But it was actually very warm so I think they were happy to have cold feet,\" he says, adding that temperatures reached 14C (57F) on the day.\nThe scientists managed to retrieve their instruments a few days later once the water had drained away through small cracks in the ice sheet. \"Then you have a short period of time when you can then travel again before the ice collapses and breaks up,\" says Olsen.\nOlsen says he was extremely surprised by the rapid melting he witnessed when he took the photo on 13 June 2019. He has only experienced such an extreme event once during his 15 years carrying out research in Greenland. It's unusual for melting to occur that quickly, Olsen explains.\n\"It requires a sudden onset of warm air while you still have fresh snow on the ice and solid sea ice. So it's an example of an extreme event developing early in the season... The local community have told me: 'you will have to wait 100 years to see [such an event] again'.\"\u00a0\nMelting events such as the one Olsen witnessed would normally not occur until later in the season, in late June and July, but in 2019 melting started in mid-April, around six to eight weeks before the 1981-2020 average, and affected roughly 95% of Greenland's ice sheet, according to the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSuch early melting events can have a \"snowball effect\" and lead to more melting as there is less snow and ice to reflect the Sun's rays back into space and keep the surface cool, explains Bianca Perren, a paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who studies sediment cores from polar regions to understand the long-term variability of the climate.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Antarctica's upside-down ice-scape we had no idea existed\n\u2022\u00a0The 'mind bomb' photos that changed the whaling industry\n\u2022\u00a0Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\nGreenland experienced record ice loss in 2019, shedding a total of 532 billion tonnes from its giant ice sheet, according to a 2020 study. On average, Greenland loses 234 billion tonnes of ice per year\u00a0\u2013 enough to pack into 6,324 Empire State Buildings.\n\"2019 was a really unusually warm year, but so was 2012,\" says Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist at BAS who studies the impacts of Greenland's melting ice sheet. In 2012, the summer period (June-August) was more than 2C (4F) warmer than the average for 1981-2010, and more than 1.5C (3F) warmer for the entire ice sheet. \"Those extremes are coming round more frequently than we had thought they would. They're happening every few years,\" says Hogan.\n\"What's really distinctive about Greenland is how much melting you get on the surface in the summer, because you don't get anywhere near as much as that in Antarctica,\" says Hogan. \"When you see huge volumes of water [on the ice], it is really shocking.\"\nBut it's rare to see \"giant pools of water\" on the surface like in Olsen's photo, says Perren, as usually the water seeps through cracks in the ice. \"It basically pops the ice sheet up and floats it out to the coast. So often you don't have this pooling of water, but instead you have warm water that's being sent down into the bowels of the Greenland ice sheet, basically warming the whole thing,\" she says.\nThe rapid melting of the ice is already affecting local communities' way of life. \"They are having to adapt the way they hunt and fish,\" says Olsen.\nIf the ice is unsafe to travel on, it also makes it more difficult for scientists to carry out their research, Olsen adds. \"We will have to adapt and rely more on automatic instruments instead of community-based monitoring.\"\u00a0\nSafety is already a concern, says Perren, adding: \"I have promised my son that I will not step foot on the ice sheet because it's so dangerous.\"\nThe photo has helped raise awareness of Greenland's vulnerability to climate change, says Olsen. \"I have definitely found that you can get a lot of attention for the problem with a photo\u2026 so it has been very efficient.\n\"But I've also been challenged by people saying: 'how can you take a photo of climate change?' And I agree, you cannot take one photo and call it climate change, because that is something that unfolds over a longer time period,\" says Olsen. \"We need to explain the photo and provide the right context.\"\nPhotos are useful tools for starting conversation about the environment and explaining scientific phenomena, says Perren. \"Science has a communication problem,\" she says.\n\"When I first saw it in 2019 I remember thinking: 'oh my gosh, this is such a shocking image,'\" adds Perren. \"It's a symbolic image of what climate change looks like in Greenland. But there's also a scientific side to it: maybe this is unprecedented but it also [paints] a very good, kind of emblematic picture of what the future would look like.\"\nHogan says that photo \"really drives home the extent of the problem\". \"It looks like the dogs are skating on something without a bottom\u2026 it feels like they could just sink at any moment, which is maybe some sort of metaphor for the ice sheet and the future.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

Some of those players are maybe expecting him to hit a cross-court forehand, they're almost going that way. And then when he is hitting a flatter one down the line they are not sure.\n\"I've seen quite a lot of them trying to slice the ball on the forehand, because they have not got the footwork in because they think it's going the other way.\"\nCoach James Trotman, who has worked with Draper since he was a teenager, has been a driving force in his success.\n\"Jack has a way of playing that we should be looking to execute first and foremost,\" he told the ATP website., external\n\"A big part of [our] journey is to try and impose his weapons and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand.\"\nWelcome to Second Serve - your new weekly tennis briefing\nFormer world number one Andy Murray might be in Novak Djokovic's coaching box nowadays, but the long-time flagbearer of British tennis continues to have an influence on Draper.\nTwo core pillars of the recently-retired Scot's team - physiotherapist Shane Annun and fitness coach Matt Little - are now part of Draper's inner circle.\nJust two years ago, Draper was lamenting being known as \"the guy who got injured all the time\".\nBuilding his fitness in the gym has allowed him to compete more regularly on the tour - instrumental in his rise up the rankings.\n\"Being away from home, waking up early on a daily basis \u2013 it's like groundhog day,\" Draper told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.\n\"Putting in hours and hours on the court, in the gym, in the ice bath at the end of the day when I don't want to.\n\"It's like a normal job. Some days you really enjoy it and other times you don't want to get out of bed.\n\"But you do it anyway and do it to the best of your ability because you know it is going to pay off on the big stage.\"\nOff the court, Draper has spent nights in Indian Wells playing Monopoly Deal - a shorter version of the classic board game - and refuelling with healthy takeaways.\n\"As much as I enjoy playing, being around my team and doing the right thing, it's one thing saying you'll do the hard work and another to do it when you're tired and really don't want to,\" Draper added.\n\"That is what feels good when you're playing well on court.\"\nJack Draper won the third title of his career in Indian Wells and moved up to a career-high ranking of seventh in the world\nDraper's rise over the past year has been solid and steady.\nHis first trophy came on the Stuttgart grass in June last year, followed by an ATP 500 hard-court title in Vienna in October.\nHis run to the US Open semi-finals captured the attention of the wider British public, although his nerves were illustrated by vomiting on court in a defeat by eventual champion Jannik Sinner.\nDraper began seeing a \"breathing coach\" to help solve the issue, and he pointed to the way he came through the third set against Alcaraz as an example of his improved composure.\n\"I had a few doubts before the Indian Wells final wondering if would feel the same things - but I didn't,\" he said.\n\"I was really strong and focused on my breathing and things I could control. That's what I was really proud of.\"\nThe next step from Masters champion is a logical one - becoming a Grand Slam champion.\nWinning Indian Wells is no guarantee of future major success but as Dominic Thiem, Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu have shown, coming through a 96-player field of the very best opponents is a strong indicator.\nHard courts have been Draper's most successful surface, but the next two majors are on the French Open clay-courts and Wimbledon grass.\nSo far he has struggled on clay, but his improved footwork should help, while the increasingly dangerous serve and groundstrokes are suited to grass-court success.\n\"I still feel I have a lot to prove on the clay,\" Draper added.\n\"I didn't get it going last year, but I don't see why I can't be pushing the best players on that surface.\n\"As for grass, I feel my game has improved massively since last year.\"\nFrom hothead to warrior - Draper's journey to US Open semis\nHow Britain's Draper became US Open semi-finalist",

Or are mid-table finishes about right given what's at their disposal?\nTownsend optimistic on future but is it 'time for change'?\n'Scotland bum cheek away from converting' in Paris\nReaction, analysis & have your say\nDecisions went against Scotland throughout the championship. Pundits were taken aback when France hooker Peato Mauvaka's headbutt on Ben White was only punished with a yellow card while the hosts were 10-0 ahead in Paris.\nBut ultimately, the Scots didn't capitalise against Ireland, England and France when the matches were in the balance and went on to suffer three defeats.\nWhen asked if Scotland deserved to finish higher than fourth, head coach Gregor Townsend was clear.\n\"No, if we don't win when we have a lot of the game, that's where we are going to finish,\" he said.\n\"It is a very tough competition. Teams can't play well every game; no-one won a Grand Slam. We are a quality side, it just didn't go our way this year.\"\nThis video can not be played\nScotland 'can match world's best packs' - Townsend\nFrance are the benchmark just now. A thriving domestic league, a thriving youth setup, and a thriving grassroots scene. It's night and day from the situation in Scotland. \n\"Look at our player participation numbers,\" said former Scotland forward Johnnie Beattie. \"France have hundreds of thousands and we have around 20,000 adults.\n\"That is not something Scottish fans will want to hear but when you look at numbers, that is where we are.\"\nWe can quibble over the precise numbers, perhaps, but the thrust of Beattie's argument is unimpeachable. \nNo more was the difference in depth exposed than after 46 minutes of play in Paris, when France head coach Fabien Galthie turned to his bench.\nJulien Marchand, Cyril Baille, Dorian Aldegheri, Emmanuel Meafou, Oscar Jegou and Anthony Jelonch were all sent on to turn the tide the home side's way. \nWorld-class back-rower and France captain Gregory Alldritt was removed from the fray, because he can be. It worked a treat. \nIn contrast, Townsend left replacement prop Will Hurd on the bench and asked Zander Fagerson to play the full 80 minutes. \nOf those who were introduced, Ewan Ashman is plagued by line-out throwing issues; Ewan Johnson plies his trade in France's second tier with Oyonnax; and Marshall Sykes is not a guaranteed starter for struggling Edinburgh. \nThe Scottish replacements left everything out on the pitch when they came on, but they are being asked to compete with a different level of player.\nIt was a similar tale in the defeat by Ireland. Scotland were outthought and outmuscled at Murrayfield.\nFormer Irish fly-half Ronan O'Gara said \"it felt like a 40-point win\" for Ireland that day, and he wasn't exaggerating.\nWhen push comes to shove, Scotland are a level below the northern hemisphere's elite sides.\nBecause of that lack of depth, Scotland are forced to play in a manner that isn't conducive to grinding out Test match win after Test match win. \nTheir gameplan in Paris was clear. Keep the ball alive, take risks, play with pace and width and get their talented backline involved as much as possible.\n\"We played with some fantastic endeavour and were quite sharp on the ball, but we couldn't break through, get in behind and really stress them,\" former Scotland full-back Chris Paterson said.\n\"Scotland played the right way, gave ourselves the best opportunity by keeping the ball alive, playing as quick as possible. It wasn't always accurate but it's the right way to go about it.\"\nFormer Scotland prop Peter Wright echoed those thoughts: \"I was pretty proud of the way Scotland played. They stuck at it, went out and tried to play the game that could have beaten France.\n\"They had a go, moved the ball, played with width. [Blair] Kinghorn had one of his best games. [Duhan] van der Merwe and [Darcy] Graham looked dangerous.\"\n\"[Finn] Russell will get a lot of criticism for certain things, but I thought he played pretty well and gave Scotland a chance. He varied the game enough to try and hurt the French.\"\nTownsend's side were not fixated on playing the percentages and relying on a solid set-piece, because this Scotland team cannot do that.\nThey have magnificent moments in games, plays that take your breath away, but because of the high-risk strategy they rarely deliver for the duration of a match, let alone for multiple matches across a championship.\nTheir first-half performance was excellent at Stade de France, but they were brushed aside as legs grew tired and mistakes were punished.\nTownsend's side have beaten Italy and the worst Welsh team for a generation in this tournament. That is it.\nPerhaps Wright summed it up best. \n\"Ultimately, France are a better side,\" he said. \"There are world-class players all over the pitch, they can bring real quality off the bench and that just adds to the tempo and physicality.\"\n'Scotland put lot into it, but France just better'\n15/03/25",

Some of the best-selling games on Nintendo's Switch system - Mario Kart 8 and the Mario Party series - are frequently played with mates around the TV.\nIn recent years, developers have tried to replicate the success of games like Fortnite - so-called \"live service\" titles that constantly update and retain players for months, if not years.\nIf you get it right, the potential financial rewards are huge, but cutting through in a saturated market is difficult.\nAnd as the video games industry continues to deal with mass layoffs, studio closures and decreased spending on premium games, not many publishers want to take a risk.\nJosef believes there may be too much focus on the bottom line.\n\"Publishers need to step up and really trust the developer,\" he says.\n\"But also developers, I think, need to have a clear vision and stick with what they believe in.\"\nHe does admit, though, that not everyone has his studio's history, nor his personality.\n\"I am a - what do you say? - a different breed,\" says Josef.\nWhen he was directing his first game, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, feedback from some early playtests was \"super bad\".\n\"I'm like, they're wrong, they're wrong, because I know it's great,\" he says.\nHe's spoken before about resisting pressure to put micro-transactions - in-game purchases - in his projects, and is uncompromising despite his studio's close relationship with EA, one of the world's biggest publishers.\n\"I don't expect everybody to be like me, but that's me with my extreme confidence,\" he says.\n\"What we do, I love it.\n\"We're sticking to the vision of what we believe in.

That may never be made public.\nThe pressure is on to justify the financial waste.\nWhy did it take so long to reach an agreement?\nBoth sides were entrenched. For two years, they were in conflict, with the presenters off screen for half of that time.\nContracts are binding. Employees remain on full pay while internal disputes are resolved. But this one took a long time, and they continued to fight when they returned to work. Only, on the brink of the tribunal, was there a resolution.\nThe BBC will have had licence fee payers in mind when weighing up whether to proceed to a full tribunal or settle. It apparently decided it wasn't worth going through three damaging weeks, with all the headlines and media attention that would have generated.\nA settlement is always likely to bring down costs. The impact of a tribunal can be substantial, and there is also the potential for appeals and further hearings that increase the financial impact.\nBut the optics of the last two years, ending in a settlement, aren't good. And there is frustration inside the BBC about the impact of it all, at a time when budgets are shrinking.",

So I wanted to really have a look and try and shine a light on this particular thing.\"\nWriter Jack Thorne said they wanted to \"look in the eye of male rage\".\nThe central character had been \"indoctrinated by voices\" like Andrew Tate's and \"voices a lot more dangerous than Andrew Tate's\", Thorne told Radio 4's Front Row.\nErin Doherty, who plays a child psychologist, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This show has the bravery to just peel back the layers and go, let's talk about this thing, because we're still dealing with it today. There are still issues cropping up in the news today.\n\"So all we can hold ourselves accountable for is having the discussion, and hopefully that's what it does. It just allows parents, aunties, uncles, even just friends, to engage in the conversation.\"\nEach episode was filmed in a single, uninterrupted take.\nIn the Guardian, Mangan said its technical accomplishments \"are matched by an array of award-worthy performances and a script that manages to be intensely naturalistic and hugely evocative at the same time\".\nShe added: \"Adolescence is a deeply moving, deeply harrowing experience.\"\nPeck's review in the Times began: \"Wow. Just wow. I'm tempted to type out the word 'wow' a further 700 times or so, followed by, 'Don't miss Adolescence on Netflix,' and then be done with it.\"\nThe Telegraph's TV critic Anita Singh said it was \"a devastating watch\", adding: \"It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\" \nSingh said the single-shot technique \"can feel like a gimmick\" but that the acting is \"phenomenal\".\nGraham is \"the best actor working today\", but \"the truly remarkable performance\" is by Cooper, she wrote.\n\"He moves between vulnerability, anger, bravado and fear. What he does here is astonishing.\"\n\nElsewhere, Deadline's Jake Kanter wrote: \"Adolescence is as flawless a four hours of TV drama I have ever seen. It lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled. Astonishing telly.\"\nRolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall said it was \"among the very best things - and an early contender for the best thing - you will see on the small screen this year\".\nThe New York Times' Margaret Lyons called it \"a rich work of social critique\", describing the standout episode, the third, as \"one of the more fascinating hours of TV I've seen in a long time\".\nOn BBC Radio 5 Live's Must Watch, Hayley Campbell said the drama doesn't attempt to solve the problems it raises.\n\"It's bringing it up, it's looking at it. It's about the rise of misogyny, especially in young boys, brought about by people like Andrew Tate, who's namechecked in this, but only once. It's not about him.\n\"The drama is more about the horror of how little control you have over your kid and what they're doing on their phone.\"\nFellow critic Scott Bryan added: \"The performances are absolutely fantastic. I would say this is flawless. The person, though, I think who deserves the most recognition is 15-year-old Owen Cooper.\"",

Their World Cup adventure was ended by New Zealand while, in the Italian capital on Saturday, any faint Irish hopes of remaining at the Six Nations summit were emphatically crushed when England put Wales to the sword.\nIt ensured a dispiriting end to a Six Nations that at one stage promised much for Ireland. \nA Triple Crown-securing win over Wales in round three stirred hopes of a Grand Slam and a third straight title, only for France to tear up the script in Dublin. \nBut unlike England, who scored 10 tries in a record win in Cardiff, Ireland were unable to sign off in style, instead allowing Italy to dream of victory up until the closing stages.\nIreland's title hopes end despite bonus-point win in Italy\nIreland 'trying a bit too hard' in Italy win - Easterby\nThis video can not be played\nSheehan shines as Ireland hold off Italy in Rome\nThe World Cup was seen as Ireland's big chance. A year removed from a historic series success in New Zealand and six months on from completing the Grand Slam on home soil, it felt as though the squad were peaking at the right time. \nIt proved a false dawn. Johnny Sexton, the heartbeat of Irish rugby, was denied a fairytale ending to his Test career. Eighteen months on, three of his long-time team-mates - Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray - bow out amid a feeling of what might have been. \nAnd the curtain closing on three more illustrious careers in green brings into focus the need for Ireland to evolve. \nEven before the France game, Paul O'Connell admitted the squad will encounter \"days when we struggle\" given the experience drain. \nAnd while striking a more positive note, Caelan Doris hammered home the need for improvement on the road ahead as he recapped his first Six Nations as captain on Saturday. \n\"There are obviously lots of things we can learn and grow from over the last couple of weeks and I hope that it will be a springboard for us as a group to go on and continue to evolve, and a bit of a realisation that there's still a lot of work to be done and a lot in us,\" said the Irish skipper. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders\nFor the first time in 14 years, O'Mahony will not be part of that work. \nHaving poured his lot into the Irish cause over a career that yielded 114 caps and five Six Nations titles - including one as captain - the Munster great is looking forward to watching games from the stands with his family. \nAnd as he bows out, O'Mahony - as well-placed as anyone to comment on the health of Irish rugby - insists the team is still in \"incredible shape\" despite a third-place finish, considering where they have come from. \nO'Mahony, of course, was one of the last links to the darker days, pointing to the famous 2013 loss to Italy in Rome. \nIreland finished fifth that year, but rebuilt impressively under Joe Schmidt after Declan Kidney's departure, capturing back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015 before the Grand Slam three years later.\n\"Now the expectation of everyone in Ireland when we take to the pitch is that we win,\" said O'Mahony, who received a rapturous ovation when he replaced Josh van der Flier after 51 minutes against Italy.\n\"The expectation when we start the Six Nations is that we win the Six Nations. That's down to the hard work of the players. We've gone from hoping to expecting. Over the space of a decade or so, we've changed the mindset of players and supporters to expect nothing but wins from Ireland. \n\"That group is one of the most talented you'll ever come across from an Irish point of view. I look at the younger players I've been lucky enough to play alongside over the past eight weeks, it's getting better and better. \n\"It gives me a huge amount of pride, Cian [Healy] spoke inside about leaving a mark on the younger players and if I've made a little difference or shown them a few things not to do, I'd be a happy man.\"\nProp Jack Boyle was the only Ireland debutant during this year's Six Nations\nThe pain of relinquishing their Six Nations crown will be acute in the days ahead, but Ireland have much to look forward to in the remainder of 2025. \nHowever, before a Chicago rematch against the All Blacks and mouthwatering Dublin Tests against Australia and South Africa in November, interim boss Simon Easterby will oversee a summer tour. \nWhile the details have not been confirmed, matches against Georgia, Romania and Portugal have been mooted. \nRegardless of the opponents, though, it will be a crucial period as Easterby looks to future-proof the squad and introduce new talent to the international game while his frontline players are on the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. \nSince last year's Six Nations triumph, Ireland have blooded Jamie Osborne, Tom Clarkson, Sam Prendergast, Cormac Izuchukwu, Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle. \nBut outside of the retiring O'Mahony and Conor Murray, 10 of Ireland's 23 against Italy are at least 30 years of age, highlighting the need for squad progression. \nSummer tours on Lions years have in the past been fertile ground for Ireland. The 2017 tour to Japan, for example, marked the emergence of Jacob Stockdale, Andrew Porter and James Ryan. \nWhether or not Ireland uncover a similar calibre of player this year remains to be seen, but there appears an acknowledgement of the need to deepen the squad before Andy Farrell's return from Lions duty. \nNow the work must start.",

Musk says first mission to Mars will launch next year2 days agoShareSaveSeher AsafBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesSpaceX founder Elon Musk has said his Starship rocket will head to Mars by the end of next year, as the company investigates several recent explosions in flight tests.Human landings could begin as early as 2029 if initial missions go well, though \"2031 was more likely\", he added in a post on his social media platform X. Starship -  the largest rocket ever created standing at 123m -  is crucial to Musk's ambitions to colonise the planet Mars.However it has suffered multiple failures in tests - one of the rockets exploded minutes after it was launched from Texas as part of a test last week, the second failure this year after a similar \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" in January.SpaceX said it would review data \"to better understand [the] root cause\" of the most recent explosion and noted it happened after the loss of \"several\" engines.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the company would be required to conduct an investigation before it could fly again.Nasa hopes to use a modified version of the spaceship as a human lunar lander for its Artemis missions to return to the Moon.ReutersDebris was seen falling from the Bahamas after the rocket exploded last week. In 2024, he said he would launch the first Starships to Mars in 2026, with plans to send crewed flights in four years. The tech billionaire has grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humans to the Moon, and then on to Mars, making humans \"multi-planetary\".Musk has long targeted a trip to Mars.",

        "article_text": "We are surrounded by an invisible killer. One so common that we barely notice it shortening our lives.\nIt's causing heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and studies now even link it to dementia.\nWhat do you think it could be?\nThe answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing.\n\"It is a public health crisis, we've got huge numbers of people exposed in their everyday life,\" says Prof Charlotte Clark, from St George's, University of London.\nIt's just a crisis we don't talk about.\nSo I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world.\nI started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch.\nIt's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats.\nYou can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel.\nThe one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam.\nAnd the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more.\n\"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared.\nOnly the joyful sounds of the playground have a calming effect on my body. The dogs barking and the neighbour's party in the early hours lead to a negative response.\nBut why is sound changing my body?\n\"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark.\nSound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.\nThis is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.\n\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.\nAll of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.\n\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.\nInsidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.\n\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.\nNoise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes \u2013 are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise.\nI meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de Gr\u00e0cia area of Barcelona, Spain.\nThere's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie.\nFrom the balcony you can see the city's famous basilica, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave.\n\"It's extremely noisy\u2026 it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks.\nShe gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate.\nHer home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\".\nShe has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says.\nIn Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization.\nAcross Europe noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health.\nI meet Dr Foraster at a caf\u00e9 that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here.\nWe can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume.\nThe crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.\n\"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster.\nAnd that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says.\nAlthough it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise.\nDr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend.\n\"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says.\nA loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise.\nThe sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.\nDr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road \u2013 my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels \u2013 and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s.\nBut there is something different about this street \u2013 it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old crossroads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly.\nRemember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body.\n\"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says. \nThe initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together.\nDr Mueller performed the research projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits.\nBut in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment.\nThe dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities.\nDhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns.\nArtist Mominur Rahman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem.\nFor about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance.\nHe took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says.\n\"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\"\nBut here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise.\nThere is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.\nShe said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"\nThe solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.\nWhat I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".\nLOUD was produced by Gerry Holt.

        "article_text": "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill. \nThe focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.\nThat bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.\nBut this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.\nAnd charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.\nThere are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:\nBBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.\nThe working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.\nThat would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.\nBy 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.\nThe other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.\nOne straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year.\n\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nFreezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.\nBut you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.\nAlso, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.\nUnder previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.\nAnd from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.\nSo cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.\nRather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.\nFor instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.\nBut it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.\nPIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.\nPIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.\nYet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).\nAnother attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.\nThe reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.\nOfficial decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around two-thirds are ultimately decided in the challenger's favour at an independent tribunal.\n\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.\nAnother way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.\nAround 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.\nOne potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.\nThe fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.\nHowever, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.\nThe OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).\nAnother potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.\nSome advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.\nThere have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.\nEvaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.\nHowever, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.\nThat implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.\nNevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.\n\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.\nCorrection 17 March: an earlier version of this article wrongly stated the percentage of claimants' appeals upheld, based on DWP appeals.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump says \"many elements\" of a peace agreement in Ukraine have been agreed with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, ahead of their much anticipated phone call.\nTrump posted on Truth Social that he will speak with Putin on Tuesday morning.\nHe said that while there have been agreements, \"much remains\" to be worked upon.\n\"Each week brings 2,500 soldier deaths, from both sides, and it must end NOW. I look very much forward to the call with President Putin,\" Trump wrote.\nHe earlier told reporters that \"we're going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace, and I think we'll be able to do it\".\nIn his nightly address on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Putin of prolonging the war.\n\"This proposal could have been implemented long ago,\" he said, adding that \"every day in wartime means human lives\".\nThere have been inconsistencies from within the Trump administration over how advanced the ceasefire talks are. \nSpeaking after his meeting in Jeddah with Ukrainian officials, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the \"bulk\" of the conversation had been \"what a negotiation process would look like\" and not \"the specific conditions\".\nUS envoy Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin on Thursday in Moscow, has also struck a more measured tone. \nMeanwhile, the UK and France have urged Putin to prove he wants a peace deal with Ukraine.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron hailed the \"courage\" of Zelenksy in agreeing to a ceasefire proposal, and challenged Russia to do the same.\n\"Enough deaths. Enough lives destroyed. Enough destruction. The guns must fall silent,\" Macron said in a post on X.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Putin should agree to a \"full and unconditional ceasefire now\", telling MPs he had seen \"no sign\" that Putin was serious about a peace deal.\nHe warned that the UK and its allies have \"more cards that we can play\" to help force Russia to negotiate \"seriously\".\nThe White House sounded a more upbeat note on the eve of the Trump-Putin talks, which will take place by phone, saying peace in Ukraine has \"never been closer\".\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that Trump was \"determined\" to secure the peace deal.\nOn what the talks might cover, she said: \"There's a power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine that was up for discussion with the Ukrainians, and he will address it in his call with Putin tomorrow.\"\nThe facility is likely to be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, and fears of a nuclear accident have persisted due to fighting in the area.\nAsked on Sunday what concessions were being considered in the ceasefire negotiations, Trump said: \"We'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants [...] We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.\"\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on what the leaders would discuss, responding, \"we never do that\". \nWhile Putin has previously said he supports a ceasefire, he also set out a list of conditions for achieving peace.\nOne of the areas of contention is Russia's Western Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory.\nRussia had pushed to recapture it in recent weeks, and Putin now claims it is fully back in control of Kursk.\nHe has also raised numerous questions about how a ceasefire could be monitored and policed along the frontline in the east, and has said he would not accept Nato troops on the territory.\nThe peace proposal on the table was discussed by Ukrainian and American delegates in Saudi Arabia last week.\nAfter hours locked away in a room, they announced proposals for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine said it was ready to accept.\nFrance's President Macron and newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who met on Tuesday, stressed their nations would continue their  \"unwavering\" support of Ukraine and demand \"clear commitments\" from Russia.

        "article_text": "The live-action version of the classic fairy-tale animation sounded like a surefire hit. But even before it's reached cinemas, the response to it has been loud and often hostile.\nYou wouldn't think that the war in Gaza would have much impact on a Disney remake. But the live-action Snow White, a revamped version of the 1937 animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, has become a flashpoint for social and political divisions, even before its global release next week. \u00a0\nThere was some backlash to the casting of Rachel Zegler, of Colombian descent, as the heroine. More recently, there has been blowback both about Zegler's pro-Palestinian comments and about pro-Israel comments by Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen. And there is an ongoing debate about whether there should have been dwarfs at all, live or CGI. The film's director, Marc Webb, said in Disney's official production notes, \"I think all good stories evolve over time. They become reflections of the world that we live in\". He has likely got more than he bargained for, as reactions to Snow White inadvertently reflect the most polarised aspects of the world today. Like political rhetoric in countries around the world, responses to the film's production have been loud, irate and sometimes ugly.\nSnow White has been in the works since 2019, and began in earnest with Zegler's casting in 2021. Since then attacks on its so-called \"wokeness\" have proliferated, making the film a lightning rod for opinions that have little to do with the fairy tale it is based on. A recent Hollywood Reporter article asked, \"Have some PR missteps combined with anti-woke outrage turned marketing the film into a poisoned apple?\" And alongside such measured reporting there have been heated responses in the media. The editorial board of the New York Post \u2013 owned by Rupert Murdoch, the conservative mogul whose company also owns Fox News \u2013 weighed in this week, declaring the film a financial disaster before it has opened, writing: \"Disney 'Snow White' controversy proves it again: Go woke, go broke!\"\nThe original film needed an update if it was going to be remade at all. In its day it set a high bar for Disney's future animated films, but it also introduced the song Someday My Prince Will Come, blighting the expectations of generations of girls by setting them up to wait for a Prince Charming to make their lives complete. Meanwhile, Snow White happily sweeps the floor for the dwarfs until he shows up to rescue her with a kiss after she bites the Queen's poisoned apple. Soon after her casting announcement, Zegler told the television show Extra that in the old Snow White \"there was a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her\". In fact, the original film states that he \"searched far and wide\" to find her after falling in love at first sight, and he disappears for most of the film, so no need to take that comment too seriously. Zegler was excited and laughing when she said it. But in an early sign of the blinkered reactions to come, social media posts complained that she was anti-love.\nSome people also rejected the idea that a Latina actress could play a character called Snow White; alongside criticisms of such non-traditional casting, Zegler was subject to racist trolling. This was a similar reaction to that experienced by the black actress Halle Bailey when she was cast as Ariel in 2023's The Little Mermaid.\nThe film stumbled into more trouble simply because its lead actresses expressed political opinions. On X in August 2024, Zegler thanked fans for the response to the Snow White trailer, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".\nGadot has posted her support for Israel on social media, and especially since the 7 October attacks by Hamas has been outspoken in defence of her country and against anti-semitism. That led to some short-lived calls by pro-Palestinian social media users to boycott the film simply because she is in it.\nThe fallout on the film intensified after the 2024 US presidential election. Zegler posted on Instagram that she was \"heartbroken\" and fearful, and that she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\". In response Megyn Kelly, the former Fox news personality, attacked Zegler, saying on her radio show, \"This woman is a pig,\" and that Disney was going to have to recast the role. Zegler apologised to Trump voters, saying \"I let my emotions get the best of me\".\nEven when people reacting to the film have agreed on a basic principle, like more opportunities for actors who have dwarfism, they have disagreed on how to get there. Peter Dinklage, perhaps the world's most well-known actor with dwarfism, questioned the entire project before many details were known, calling the 1937 film \"a backwards story of seven dwarfs living in a cave together\". Disney announced the next day, \"To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters.\"\nAs it turned out, the seven characters are CGI, and Disney has reclassifed them as \"magical creatures\", not dwarfs. What do they look like? Even a glimpse at the trailer reveals that they look exactly like CGI dwarfs. They are still named Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful and Dopey.\nThe changes have caused a backlash from some people with dwarfism, who have rebutted Dinklage and accused Disney of depriving them of acting roles. As recently as this week, one told the Daily Mail, \"I think Disney is trying too hard to be politically correct, but in doing so it's damaging our careers and opportunities.\" \nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 of the best films to watch this March\n\u2022\u00a0The real meaning of Wicked\n\u2022\u00a0Why Disney had a hard centenary year\nAmidst this swirl of controversies, Disney altered the traditional red-carpet treatment it would usually give such a major film. The premiere took place in Spain on 12 March, and the Los Angeles premiere is due to take place today at an unusual, afternoon hour. The regular red-carpet journalists have not been invited, even though as a group they are not known to ask hard-hitting questions.\nTrying to avoid more political and social discord isn't Disney's only Snow White problem, though. There is much online speculation that the film might just be bad. The first full trailer was greeted with a rush of complaints about the underwhelming CGI, with The Guardian calling the trailer \"the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\". The film has new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the team behind La La Land, but the one released as a video, Waiting On a Wish, has a bland, generic Disney style. Box-office tracking predicts an opening weekend of around $50m (\u00a339m), solid but at the low end for a would-be blockbuster that reportedly cost over $200m (\u00a3155m) to make.\nOf course, given the Disney juggernaut \u2013 the recent Moana 2 has made more than $1bn (\u00a3773m) and Mufasa: The Lion King, which had a slow start, more than $712m (\u00a3550m) \u2013 the debacle leading up to Snow White's opening may not hurt it at the box office at all. Or the film may become the victim of its moment, a fairy-tale princess covered in mud.\u00a0\nSnow White is released internationally on March 21\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

Dupont magic leads to first try of Six Nations\nThere were a couple of moments during the championship that reminded everyone of France scrum-half Antoine Dupont's fallibility.\nAgainst Wales, he booted prime ball straight into the Stade de France stands.  Against England, he juggled and dropped a relatively simple pass, with the line at his mercy.\nThe knee ligament injury he suffered against Ireland, buckling under Beirne's weight at the breakdown, reminded us of his mortality.\nBut there were plenty of glimpses of his greatness as well, the things that, for all deputy Maxime Lucu's speed of pass and territorial kicking, were lost to France in his absence.\nDupont's use of the kick-pass to circumvent a defence that has pinched in tight against France's power gives them another dimension.\nIn France's tournament opener, after their heavy brigade had bashed away at a stubborn Wales defence for 12 phases, Dupont picked up the ball and dawdled sideways and backwards off the back of the breakdown.\nFor most coaches, that is a cardinal sin. But it drew the Welsh defence forwards and when Dupont chipped to the far wing, Josh Adams was wrong-footed and unable to stop Theo Attissogbe gathering and scoring the first of 30 French tries in the tournament.\nIn Dupont's absence, France were even deploying the tactic in defence, with Louis Bielle-Biarrey punting wide to opposite wing Damian Penaud during an audacious exit against Ireland.\nNo other team deployed the tactic as accurately.\nThis video can not be played\nScotland survive late Wales comeback to win\nScotland finished fourth in the final table, but if there were backline style marks to hand out they would have come top of the scorecards.\nThey carried the ball more and further than any other team by a distance and also threw the most passes., external\nThe absence of injured captain Sione Tuipulotu at centre might have forced them to play with more width than they had originally intended, but it made for some scintillating scores.\nPerhaps the best illustration of what they can do from deep was their second try in their win over Wales.\nFrom a breakdown on the left touchline, a narrow forward charge proved to be a decoy with Finn Russell instead throwing a long pass to Blair Kinghorn, giving up territory, but opening up opportunities.\nWhile Darcy Graham's dancing feet threaten on one wing, it was Duhan van der Merwe's power that shrugged off Ellis Mee on the other, creating space for Huw Jones on the outside.\nSupport flooded through on the inside with Tom Jordan taking the pass and scoring.\nScotland lack the depth and heft up front of other nations, but their athleticism, creativity and understanding in open space can slice though any team.\nThis video can not be played\nDominant France win to end Ireland's grand slam hopes\nIreland may have finished third, but their meeting with France in round four was the headlining heavyweight contest on the Six Nations card.\nThere are many deep, structural reasons behind France's victory \u2013 a successful youth development system that pulls in players from different areas and background, their powerhouse clubs falling into line behind the national team and coach Fabien Galthie's adoption of forward-heavy replacements bench are among them.\nBut you also need gut feel; the instinct to read a situation and grab a moment, all in milliseconds.\nAs Ireland, 35-13 down, but a man up, pressed up to the France 5m line late on, full-back Thomas Ramos did just that.\nFly-half Sam Prendergast had men outside, a one or two-strong overlap, but Ramos didn't drift to try and contain Ireland.

The referee, whether influenced or not, instructed Russell to take his unsuccessful kick from a slightly tighter angle.\nBritish and Irish Lions coach Farrell was in attendance at the Principality Stadium to watch Itoje again make another persuasive case as Wales full-back Blair Murray had a try chalked off with team-mate Tomos Williams being offside.\nThe 2017 Lions series decider in New Zealand pivoted on a similar incident \u2013 Ken Owens picking up the ball after a knock-on by fellow Welshman Liam Williams late in the third Test.\nIs Itoje the captain the Lions of 2025 need to make their case?\nThis video can not be played\nItoje 'frontrunner' for Lions captaincy - Warburton\nFive talking points from final round of Six Nations",

She received a fourth call, also from the clinic. \nThe sheriff's office noted it never reported an official date of death for her and said that initially they'd stated that Arakawa's last known activity was on 11 February. Authorities say she'd exchanged emails with a massage therapist and visited a grocery store, pharmacy and a pet store. Garage clicker data showed she returned home around 5:15 p.m. that day. \nDr Josiah Child, who leads Cloudberry Health, told the BBC that while the clinic had never treated Hackman or Arakawa, she had reached out for medical advice.\n\n\"She called and described some congestion but didn't mention any respiratory distress, shortness of breath, or chest pain,\" he said.\nArakawa initially had scheduled an appointment for 12 February but cancelled on 10 February, explaining that she needed to care for her husband, Dr Child said. \nOn the morning of 12 February, she called again seeking treatment but because no doctor-patient relationship had been established, the clinic told her she needed to be seen in person.\n\"There were a couple calls back and forth to just schedule that appointment for the afternoon, but she never showed up,\" Dr Child explained. \"Our office called back several times and never got an answer.\" \nThe couple were both found dead on 26 February.\nChief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell stated that \"based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that [Betsy] passed away first.\"\nThe Santa Fe medical examiner determined she died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne respiratory disease.\nAuthorities believe Hackman died on 18 February - the date of his last recorded pacemaker activity, which showed an abnormal rhythm of atrial fibrillation.\nHis cause of death was severe heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease listed as a contributing factor. Experts believe his Alzheimer's may have prevented him from realising his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.\nIf he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.\nA necropsy report also revealed that one of the couple's three dogs, which had been crated while recovering from surgery, died from starvation and dehydration.\nAs the investigation continues, representatives for Hackman and Arakawa's estate have taken legal action to block the release of body camera footage and other visual evidence from their home when their remains were discovered. \nA New Mexico judge has issued a temporary restraining order that prevents their release, with a hearing set for March 31.",

Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sport Extra.\nCraig Bellamy's eyes widen with excitement when he is asked about his favourite World Cup memories.\nHe launches into an impassioned monologue charting everything from Maradona's 1986 heroics to Roberto Baggio's emergence four years later and the tactical pragmatism of Brazil in 1994.\nThat tournament in the United States lit a fire in Bellamy the teenager, convincing him that he wanted to become a professional footballer.\nHe realised that ambition with a stellar playing career that included spells at Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle United - but he never represented his country at a major tournament.\nNext year, the World Cup returns to the United States, co-hosts along with Canada and Mexico, as Wales aim to qualify for a second time in succession.\nSo as Wales prepare for their opening qualifier at home to Kazakhstan on Saturday, would taking his country to a major tournament as head coach make up for Bellamy's inability to do so as a player?\n\"No, come on! That's going to hurt me forever,\" he says with a laugh that suggests he is not entirely joking.\n\"I want the players to qualify. Do I want to coach at a World Cup? Yeah, but is it the most important? I'm OK, trust me.\n\"Do I want the money that can come back to help us invest, to help us keep improving this game of ours? That's all I get motivated for. I need that money so we've got more pitches, we build more infrastructure.\n\"I'm going to come and go\u2026 but I want a legacy. I want to be able to say, 'in his period he did this'. The more I do, I'm always thinking this is serious, this is full-time. This is not a part-time role. People in Wales deserve that.\"\nWales name teenager Andrews, but suffer Ramsey blow\nWales men's internationals to be shown live on BBC\nBellamy's 'unrealistic' aim? To make Wales a top team\nBellamy has enjoyed an excellent start to his first senior managerial tenure.\nHe is unbeaten in his six matches to date, leading Wales to promotion to the Nations League's top division last year by winning their group, which also effectively guaranteed them at least a play-off for World Cup qualification.\nThe aim is to seal their place in the tournament automatically. After Saturday's match against Kazakhstan, Wales visit North Macedonia on Tuesday, while Belgium and Liechtenstein also lie in wait.\nWales qualified for their first World Cup in 64 years in 2022 but were desperately disappointing as they exited at the group stage in Qatar.\nBellamy has set his players the target of not only qualifying for the 2026 World Cup but giving a better account of themselves when they get there \u2013 to add their names to the pantheon of greats who have graced this hallowed competition.\n\"I remember the 1986 World Cup massively. I think the first game I remember was England against Poland and [Gary] Lineker scored a hat-trick,\" Bellamy, 45, recalls.\n\"We used to go to Spain and I had a Lineker shirt. I pulled away from that because I always wanted an Argentina one with Maradona.\n\"1990 I really enjoyed, but it wasn't a great World Cup. We saw the emergence of Roberto Baggio, but then Toto Schillaci took over like an unknown. There was also the emergence of Cameroon. I would say that was a good World Cup but the most important one for me was 1994 in the USA.\n\"It was amazing because I wanted an Italy-Brazil final. There was something about Romario. I just thought it would be his World Cup. I watched Brazil every game. They were more conservative than other Brazilian teams, but I still think they had that quality.\n\"That World Cup, at the time as a kid, I wasn't sure which way I wanted to go. Did I want to be with my friends mostly? I knew that path wasn't going to take me to being a footballer. I think spending a month watching nearly every game. It was 'give me that, I want to be a footballer'.\"\nBellamy went on to reach the top of the club game but, despite counting the likes of Ryan Giggs and Gareth Bale as international team-mates, Wales never got close to reaching a World Cup during his career.\n\"I've got to be honest, we weren't good enough to qualify,\" he says. \"I never thought we were ever a team that was going to be able to qualify. Even if we had all the luck in the world, we still didn't have enough quality, I don't feel.\"\nFortunately, Bellamy feels differently about the current squad.\n\"I see a lot more, and they proved that they've done it before. That helps because they've got experience of qualifying,\" he adds.\n\"I just want to win this group but I can't look that far ahead. I know you would love me to be able to say that but, I think if I live in the real world, it's one step at a time. It really is that because otherwise you get so overwhelmed and you can miss the point of what this is. Kazakhstan is most important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nEngland's powerful physicality 'obliterated' Wales\nThere was a moment, about 15 minutes in at the Principality Stadium, when you thought you knew what you were getting.\nA scrum collapsed. Tom Curry shoved Nicky Smith. Aaron Wainwright shoved Curry. Ollie Chessum shoved Wainwright.\nAnd finally a grinning Dafydd Jenkins grabbed a fistful of Chessum's shirt, pulling it up over the England lock's mouth like a parent dabbing at a toddler's grubby face.\nTit-for-tat, toe-to-toe, close quarters and tight margins.\nWales were 14 points down, but, having had a Blair Murray try chalked off, their chins were still up. They believed. They had been down by similar margins against Ireland and Scotland and carried the fight right back.\nAgainst England - the rivals against whom both history and enmity run deepest - it is always tight. \nOnly twice in the previous 11 Six Nations meetings at the Principality - Wales' wins in 2013 and 2021 - had the two teams been separated by more than 10 points. \nThis felt like a contest. Like it always does.\nAnd then, very quickly, it didn't.\nThis video can not be played\nEngland run in 10 tries in record-breaking win\nThree tries in the space of six minutes, just before the break, did the damage.\nTommy Freeman, Chandler Cunningham-South and Will Stuart crossed for 19 unanswered points and England trotted down the tunnel 33-7 up.\nThe match was done. The desecration, though, had only just begun.\nAs England pounded Wales to a powder in the second half, the life seeped out of Cardiff's sporting cathedral.\nDaffodils wilted, dragons drooped and decibels dropped to the quiet hubbub of a cricket crowd.\nEngland didn't care about that. \nAfter a run of narrow defeats at Twickenham in the autumn, they have felt pain aplenty on their home turf. \nThey exorcised those ghosts, pummelling away with gainline dominance and ambition out the back and out wide.\nThe numbers spelled it out.\nThis 68-14 win was the most points England have ever scored against Wales, surpassing the 62 they ran in in a 2007 Rugby World Cup warm-up.\nThe 54-point margin of victory was the biggest any team has managed against Wales in not just the Six Nations, but the tournament in its Five and Home Nations guises too - a history going back to 1883.\nA raft of novices set new benchmarks.\nTom Roebuck, physical in the tackle, a threat in the air, strong in contact, was superb on his first Test start. \nHis Sale team-mate Ben Curry, winning his 11th cap, was a dervish, winning turnovers and collisions alike. \nFin Smith is making the 10 shirt his own. Henry Pollock lived up to the hype, zipping past deflated Welsh defenders for two late scores.\nEstablished names also buffed up their Lions credentials.\nTommy Freeman thundered around in midfield to great effect, having been shifted in off the wing. Ellis Genge showed the heavy-duty carrying that some feared had gone out of his game. \nMaro Itoje's captaincy chops are in evidence, making a persuasive case to the referee for Murray's disallowed try. George Ford's passing picked more holes in a gaping Welsh defence towards the end.\nTen-try England rout Wales but title bid falls short\nWelsh rugby reaches record low as England run riot \nEngland celebrate 'special' win as Wales suffer 'dark day'  - reaction & clips\nEngland's boss was more than happy.\n\"I wanted the players to play big and fast, aggressive with the ball and that's exactly what they did,\" said head coach Steve Borthwick.\n\"That's a sign that this young team just embraces challenges and it is growing and developing fast.\n\"We were just falling short before of getting those actual wins but the team has stuck to the process.\"\nThis Wales team - a pale imitation of the giants of the past - helped England look good. But a campaign featuring four wins from five games, reportedly the expectation the Rugby Football Union had set for Borthwick, doesn't offer much scope for criticism.\nEngland undoubtedly got lucky at times.\nThey lacked dimensions at others, reverting too often to the boot.\nBut a tour to Argentina and the United States this summer, where the absence of Lions tourists will open up space to blood more youngsters, is a great chance to carry some momentum and develop tactics and players.\nHaving ransacked the Principality, England were briefly set to return for a victory lap.\nWith Scotland only three points adrift at half-time in Paris, having had a try chalked off on the final play before the interval, it seemed like France might cough up the Six Nations trophy.\nA replica awaited in the bowels of Wales' stadium to be handed over to England in a ceremony behind closed doors, but in front of the television cameras.\nAs it was, Les Bleus ran away with the game at the Stade de France and England's bus into town headed instead for a more private city-centre celebration.\nIt will be more than six months until England are back together at full strength. \nBut the memories of turning a fortress into a funhouse in Cardiff will last far longer - and fuel them to further feats.\nThis video can not be played\nIt's a privilege to coach England - Borthwick",

        "article_text": "Made in Canada.\nThree words that are now a common presence on Canadian shelves, after Donald Trump's tariffs sparked a trade war with the US's northern neighbour.\nIn Canada the economic measures against it have been met with a wave of patriotism, with some consumers and businesses boycotting American products. \nOthers with operations in the US face a choice - ride out the uncertainty or bring their enterprise back home.\n\"Right now, I'm a little angry. I don't want to invest in American companies,\" says Joanna Goodman, owner of Au Lit Fine Linens, a Toronto-based bedding and nightwear company.\n\"It's about having your eggs in one basket. And right now, that basket is very reckless and very precarious,\" she continues.\nOn a tour around one of her firm's two stores, housed in a giant warehouse, Ms Goodman highlights elegantly made-up beds, mannequins in silk pyjamas, and shelves full of sweet-smelling candles \u2013 most of it made in Canada.\nBut one fifth of the stock currently comes from the US. Ms Goodman is quick to point out, \"you see how big the store is, so even 20% is a lot\".\n\"I have a lot of inventory here of American brands that I've had relationships with for 20 years. I'm not going to throw it away,\" she says. \"The question is, will I reorder?\"\nTo show Au Lit Fine Linens' commitment to Canadian manufacturers, its stores now highlight everything that is Canadian made. This is mirrored on its website, which has a \"shop all made in Canada\" section, and says \"made right here at home\".\nFrom Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, to the Ukraine war, global events in recent years have given rise to a more recent phenomenon \u2013 reshoring.\nBringing business operations back to home shores, it is the reversal of offshoring.\nBusiness leader and recently-appointed new member of Canada's Senate, Sandra Pupatello, says that reshoring is \"really obvious\" to support.\nPupatello, who had previously been Ontario's Minister of Economic Development and Trade, points to the Covid-19 pandemic, when rules of trade \"went right out the window\".\nShe specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.\nIn that moment Pupatello thought: \"We've got to be prepared for the worst\".\nShortly after, she established Reshoring Canada, a non-partisan group advocating for a more resilient supply chain in Canada.\nPupatello tells the BBC: \"If the going gets tough, Canada is on its own. And if we know that's the case, let us plan for it.\"\nA Canadian government report from last year found that there had \"not been signs of either large-scale or any notable increased reshoring by businesses\", but things could now be changing.\nRay Brougham has been trying to make inroads into the Canadian car manufacturing sector since establishing his company Rainhouse Manufacturing Canada in 2001. Based in British Columbia, it manufactures parts for a number of industries.\nThe North American car industry's integrated supply chains can see parts crossing the borders between the US, Mexico, and Canada multiple times before a vehicle is finally assembled.\nUS President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare US carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect in March.\nBut in the shadow of a trade war, Mr Brougham says he has had \"good communications\" with a large Canadian auto parts company for the first time ever. \"All of a sudden they are interested in working closer with other Canadian companies.\"\nFor Mr Brougham and others, the benefits of reshoring are clear. From giving a leg up to small companies that have struggled to compete with manufacturers overseas, to ensuring fair wages, and the environmental benefits of importing and exporting fewer goods.\nOthers, including Graham Markham, director of a food sector supplier, believe it's about adding value to products Canada already produces.\nHis Canadian firm New Protein International is currently constructing Canada's first soy protein manufacturing plant in southwest Ontario, just miles from the US border.\nCanada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of the crop, but most of it is processed overseas.\n\"We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,\" says Mr Markham.\nFrom critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change.\n\"Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically.\"\nSo, could manufacturing start coming back to Canada?  Economist Randall Bartlett says it is too early to tell.\n\"There's a lot more smoke than there is fire when it comes to actual reorganisation of supply chains and moving them domestically,\" says Mr Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Quebec-based Desjardins.\n\"I think there has been some movement toward reshoring, but I think there's a lot more narrative around it than there is actual re-establishing of manufacturing capacity.\"\nThere are major hurdles too.\nThe highly-integrated auto industry, for example, would take years to untangle. Reshoring it would require \"many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in both private and public sector investment to make happen\", according to Mr Bartlett.\nThen there's the reality of global trade.\n\"Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,\" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.\nHe says that Canada should focus on \"those industries where we have a comparative advantage\", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.\nBack at Au Lit Fine Linens in Toronto, Joanna Goodman steps into a vast stockroom, filled with the sound of carboard boxes being packed.\n\"We're shipping orders to the US that came in pre-tariffs,\" she explains, before pausing.  \"We did get an order the day of the tariffs starting, and it was a very decent-sized order.\"\nShe says that she doesn't know whether the US buyer understands that tariffs will now apply. \"He has to ask Mr Trump [why]\".\nAs for what comes next?  \"These tariffs could be gone any day. Let's see how it all unfolds, then we'll start making decisions,\" says Ms Goodman.\nLike many Canadian businesses, she's waiting for the dust to settle before deciding where to buy, where to sell, and what Made in Canada really means for the future.",
